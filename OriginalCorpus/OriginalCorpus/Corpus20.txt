  the young llanero a story of war and wild life in venezuela by w h g |kingston  kingston seems to be quite good at writing about south america | one wonders why he is so anti spanish but as he was brought up living in portugal this may have something to do with the matter | we are taken on a tour round venezuela that's the country on the north of south america that has lots of oil and whose main waterway is the orinoco | so there is a change of location from new granada and peru but we have the same problems with indians spanish troops boa constrictors and other flora and fauna | there are also the usual friendly priest and ditto doctor | there were 44 engravings in the book most of which are very nice indeed and their quality can be seen in the pdf we have produced for the book | we try to produce a pdf for every book we scan as a first task even before we start to ocr the text | it's a pity that because of the size of these pdfs we can't easily make them available on the website | we hope you will enjoy the book as much as i have enjoyed making it for you | chapter one | the home of my childhood in south america my father's history sent to school in england life at school summoned back to america voyage with my uncle to jamaica sail for venezuela chased by a spanish man of war cross the bar of the magdalena river driven on shore by a storm boat nearly wrecked our night encampment repair boat a deer shot disturbed by goahira indians flight pursued reach the port of cervanos meet tim molloy his delight at seeing us hospitably received by the commandant but very inhospitably by the mosquitoes | i should like to draw a picture though i may succeed but imperfectly of the grand scenery amid which i passed my childhood's days | far in the west rose upwards in the intense blue sky the snow capped peaks of the cordilleras or andes of south america with range beyond range of lofty mountains intervening the more distant rugged and barren the nearer clothed to their summits with trees glittering cascades leaping down their side | from rock to rock while here and there could be seen the openings of deep glens at the bottom of which copious streams came rushing forth forming the headwaters of the mighty orinoco | palms and other tropical trees surrounded our house which stood on a slightly elevated plateau below which appeared a shining lake of considerable dimensions fed by the mountain streams its waters finding an outlet at one end and from whence they flowed in a more gentle current towards the western branch of the great river | far to the east and north extended a vast plain in some parts covered with dense forests in others presenting an arid desert while beyond were to be found the wide stretching llanos of venezuela bordered on the south by the orinoco | the region i have described will be seen marked on the map in the more northern part of the south american continent | it is indeed a grand country abounding in valuable trees of various descriptions and wild animals and game of all sorts jaguars pumas tapirs and peccaries reptiles innumerable alligators anacondas rattlesnakes and birds of various species from the majestic condor and towering eagle down to the diminutive humming bird | but as i shall have to describe all sorts of curious adventures in which they and other animals played conspicuous parts i will not further particularise them at present | as i was born in the country it may be concluded that my father and mother resided there | when a very young man scarcely eighteen years of age being a friend of thomas addis emmett and lord edward fitzgerald though his family were firm protestants and carried away by mistaken patriotism he had been induced to take a part in the lamentable irish rebellion of 1798 which stained their beloved country with blood and left her in a far more deplorable condition than she had previously been | young as he was my father had been actively engaged in the various skirmishes and battles which occurred between the insurgent forces and the royal troops | he was present at arklow ross and vinegar hill where he was wounded and had it not been for the resolute courage of a devoted follower tim molloy he would have fallen into the hands of the victors | carried off the field of battle he was concealed for many weeks in a mud hut by the faithful tim who when a price was set on his head went forth nightly to obtain provisions and finally assisted him to reach the coast | he there accompanied by tim embarked on board a vessel bound for the west indies but unable to remain with safety in any of the english islands after long wanderings they landed on the shores of venezuela then belonging to the spaniards | tim fearing that should his beloved master remain at any of their ports the spanish authorities might deliver him up to the english government urged him to push farther inland | at length they reached the region i have described where their wanderings were over for my father here found a fellow exile mr denis concannan who had some years before arrived in the country and married the daughter of a spanish hidalgo of considerable wealth | he was cordially received by mr concannan and his wife who had several sons and daughters one of whom in the course of time became my father's wife and my mother | his friends at home to whom he at length divulged the place of his retreat might probably have obtained a pardon for him on the plea of his youth but though still entertaining a warm affection for his native land he had become much attached to the country of his adoption which my mother also was unwilling to leave | my uncles moreover had been sent to england for their education where one of them continued to reside and my family thus kept up communication with the old country | when i was old enough to go to school my father determined to send me also to the care of my uncle denis | as we had always spoken english in our family i did not feel myself completely a stranger in a strange land and brought up among english boys i imbibed their ideas and assumed their manners and was indeed more of an englishman than an irishman and certainly more of either than of a spaniard | i need not mention any of the incidents of my school life | they were much like those other boys meet with nothing extraordinary | i made a good many friends and fought two or three battles | one was on the occasion of tom rudge a big fellow calling me an irish rebel and saying that my father had been hanged | i gave him the lie direct and replied that if he had been shot he would have died the death of a gentleman which was more than rudge himself was but that he had neither been shot nor hanged for he was alive and well and that i hoped to see him again before many years were over | i thereon planted my fist between rudge's eyes which drew fire from them and left them both swollen and blackened | we then set to and i was getting the best of it driving my antagonist backwards when one of the ushers appeared and seizing hold of me carried me up to the doctor | i pleaded that i had been grossly insulted | he replied that it was my duty to forgive insult and asked what tom rudge had said to me | i told him |  i thought that you were an orphan he observed the son of mr concannan's sister and that your father was dead |  mr concannan is my uncle sir i replied but my father is alive and well i hope in south america | the expression of surprise which passed over the master's countenance made me fear that i had said something imprudent |  if your father were dead that would only have aggravated rudge's fault he said |  i do not excuse him i will see what he has to say for himself | rudge was sent for and appeared with his two black eyes | the doctor looked at him sternly and reprimanded him for the language he had made use of |  he has been punished i see he observed and i will therefore remit the flogging he deserves and which you master desmond are liable to for fighting | now shake hands and remember that the next time you take to your fists i shall be compelled to punish you both | we shook hands as directed and were sent back to the playground and neither did rudge nor any one else again make any reflection on my family | how he had found out that my father had been engaged in the irish rebellion i could not discover | he after this for some time fought very shy of me though from that day forth he gave up bullying and we became very good friends | indeed by the wise management of the head master our school was really a very happy one though fights occasionally took place in spite of the punishment which we knew would be inflicted were we discovered infringing its laws | i had been there rather more than four years and was now nearly sixteen years of age when one day the doctor sent for me |  i am sorry that i am going to lose you desmond he said |  i have just received a letter from your uncle desiring me to send you up to town immediately as he wishes you to accompany him to south america for which country he purposes forthwith setting out | i feel it my duty to advise you as to your future conduct | the native inhabitants have i understand for some years been engaged in a fearful struggle with the spaniards to become independent of the mother country and by the last advices i see that it still continues | you may very probably be tempted to take part with the insurgents but i would urge you to remain neutral | i do not enter into the point as to whether people have a right to fight for their independence and from what i know of the spaniards i fear their rule of their american provinces has been a most tyrannical and unjust one but i do know that those who draw the sword are liable to perish by the sword and i should be very sorry to hear that such has been your fate |  i am much obliged to you sir for your kind wishes i answered and i felt the blood mantling my brow as i spoke but i cannot promise to sit at home among the women and children when those i love are hazarding their lives on the field of battle | i have heard enough of the way the spaniards have treated the inhabitants of venezuela and new granada to make my heart burn with indignation and a desire to emancipate the country my father has adopted from the cruel yoke pressing on it and if i am called on to fight in the cause i cannot refuse through fear of risking my life | the doctor smiled looking on me still as a boy |  i suspect desmond that the reason you have been sent for is that you may assist in protecting your mother and sisters should the older members of your family be engaged elsewhere | such i gather from the tenor of your uncle's letter | however remember what i have said i beg of you and may a blessing accompany you wherever you go as assuredly my prayers will follow you | i heartily thanked the kind doctor and that very day having said good bye to my school fellows including rudge who all heartily expressed their hopes that i should not get shot or be swallowed by an anaconda or eaten by a jaguar and who regarded me with some little jealousy on hearing that i was going to a country where i should meet with all sorts of adventures i set off for london | my uncle i found had already engaged a passage on board a vessel bound for jamaica whence he intended proceeding to the coast of venezuela | i had but little time to get an outfit for two days afterwards we were dropping down the thames on board the good ship betsy bound out to kingston in jamaica to bring back a cargo of sugar | next morning when i awoke i could scarcely believe my senses | it seemed but an hour since i had been at school and i at first expected to hear the morning bell ring to call the boys up | i quickly dressed and went on deck when i found that we were already at sea and under all sail doubling the north foreland | but i remembered enough of my former voyage to be perfectly at home and i felt as happy as a bird let out of a cage as it spreads its wings and soars into the free air | i told uncle denis what the doctor had said | he looked rather grave |  i must leave you to be guided by your father he said at length |  perhaps by the time we reach home the spaniards may have been driven out of the country and the blessings of peace secured | we shall know more about the matter when we get there | and he dropped the subject | on the voyage however when it was calm uncle denis gave me instruction in the use of firearms | we aimed at bottles thrown overboard as marks and sometimes had a target rigged out at the end of a studdingsail boom so i soon became a good shot both with rifle and pistol |  now barry said my uncle let us try what we can do with the sword | and producing some sword sticks he made me take one | somewhat to my surprise i found that he was an expert swordsman | he quickly initiated me into the mysteries of attack and defence which gave us plenty of occupation as it was seldom so rough that we could not practise with our weapons and many of the other passengers followed our example | i did not however altogether forget my books and employed myself in studying spanish grammatically | altogether we had a pleasant voyage and arrived safely at port royal | leaving the ship we took up our abode at kingston which i thought a remarkably hot and unpleasant place | my uncle laughed at my complaints of the heat |  you'll find your native land much hotter my boy he observed |  you've been so long getting cooled down in england that you forget what heat is | i suppose that i had done so though my father's house being on elevated ground the atmosphere round it was much cooler than in the low plains | we had to wait for some time till my uncle could secure a passage on board a schooner the flying fish captain longswill bound for the coast of venezuela | she was a fast rakish craft carrying four long guns and a parti coloured crew of determined looking fellows | soon after we got on board she made sail out of the harbour and stood away for her destination |  you should know how to load and work a gun said my uncle denis to me after we had got clear of the land you may some day have to use one in earnest | i of course was perfectly ready to be instructed and the captain directing three of the crew to assist us we cast the gun loose loaded it and fired it off | this we did several times uncle denis desiring me to watch carefully how each movement was made | i worked away with him till my arms and back ached | by that time i began to feel myself an accomplished gunner | we then ran in the gun and secured it | we performed the same operation the next day the whole crew being also exercised at the guns | we then took a turn at rifle shooting and sword exercise | in 1832 he published a series of articles on roman history entitled the c sars | it was in july 1837 that the revolt of the tartars appeared in 1840 his critical paper upon the essenes | meanwhile de quincey had begun contributions to tait's magazine another edinburgh publication and it was in that periodical that the sketches of life and manners from the autobiography of an english opium eater began to appear in 1834 running on through several years | these sketches include the chapters on wordsworth coleridge lamb and southey as well as those autobiographic sketches which form such a charming and illuminating portion of his complete works | the family life was sadly broken in 1837 by the death of de quincey's wife | he who was now left as guardian of the little household of six children was himself so helpless in all practical matters that it seemed as though he were in their childish care rather than protector of them | scores of anecdotes are related of his odd and unpractical behavior | one of his curious habits had been the multiplication of lodgings as books and manuscripts accumulated about him so that there remained room for no more he would turn the key upon his possessions and migrate elsewhere to repeat the performance later on | it is known that as many as four separate rents were at one and the same time being paid by this odd shy little man rather than allow the disturbance or contraction of his domain | sometimes an anxious journey in search of a manuscript had to be made by author and publisher in conjunction before the missing paper could be located | the home life of this eccentric yet lovable man of genius seems to have been always affectionate and tender in spite even of his bondage to opium it was especially beautiful and childlike in his latest years | his eldest daughter margaret assumed quietly the place of headship and with a discretion equal to her devotion she watched over her father's welfare | with reference to de quincey's circumstances at this time his biographer mr masson says: very soon if left to himself he would have taken possession of every room in the house one after another and 'snowed up' each with his papers but that having been gently prevented he had one room to work in all day and all night to his heart's content |  but if the spaniards were to come on board what harm could they do us | i asked |  they might find articles they would object to among the cargo and the captain has no wish to have the vessel searched he answered | uncle denis was perfectly composed and seemed to take the matter as nothing unusual | i felt as i had never felt before for i fully expected before many minutes were over to be engaged in a desperate fight | the schooner had all her sails set though at present they were useless but on looking over the side i observed cat's paws playing on the surface of the ocean | now they appeared now they vanished but as yet we had not felt the slightest breath of wind | presently however i saw the dog vane rise and flutter slightly again it drooped | the corvette meantime was stealing up and the boats were getting nearer and nearer | a shot from the headmost one could now have reached us but she appeared to be waiting for the other to get up with her | captain longswill every now and then took a glance astern to watch them | suddenly in a cheery voice he ordered the crew to trim sails and our canvas bulging out slightly the schooner began to glide slowly through the water | just then i saw a puff of smoke issue from one of the boats and a shot came ricochetting over the water passing close to our quarter | the captain laughed |  you're a little too late my boys he observed you should have pulled harder than you did if you wished to get up with us | the shot now came flying towards us as fast as the spaniards could load their guns but they all either dropped into the water astern or went whizzing by on either side | though a gun had been slewed round and pointed through one of the after ports we had not fired a shot |  we might probably knock the boat to pieces but there is no object in so doing if we can escape them with our heels observed uncle denis |  you see barry we are peaceably disposed though we don't wish to be interfered with | i now suspected what i afterwards found to be the case that the flying fish had arms and stores on board for the insurgents which she was to land at any port in their possession or else at a part of the coast where some of their troops could collect to receive them | the difficulty was to ascertain the places in the hands of the republicans for they might have possession of a town one day and it might be taken from them the next | i was perfectly ready to fight but i had no special wish to do so if it could be avoided and i was therefore glad to see our sails fill out with the steady breeze and to find that we were dropping the boats astern | the corvette was still coming on but she no longer gained on us and the wind still further increasing we found that the flying fish was much the faster craft | we were compelled however to haul our wind and stand off the coast and soon after noon had run the corvette out of sight | this adventure delayed us | after standing off for some days we hove to keeping a sharp look out | the next morning having a good breeze we again stood in towards the coast | no sail like the corvette appearing we stood on till we reached the mouth of the magnificent river magdalena inferior only in size to the orinoco and amazon on that part of the continent | after forming numerous lakes it empties itself by three mouths into the caribbean sea | off one of these mouths we brought up my uncle proposing to land with our property and ascertain the places held by the republicans at which the flying fish could safely discharge her cargo | we were afterwards to ascend the stream as far as it was navigable a voyage which would occupy us some weeks | the spot where we were to leave the river was about three days' journey by land from santa fe de bogota the capital of the province of new granada | after the boat had put us on shore she was to return to the schooner with the information we could obtain | wishing good bye to our friends who gave us three cheers we shoved off the captain crying out be smart my lads and be back as soon as possible i don't quite like the look of the weather |  ay ay sir | was the answer and we pulled away towards the passage which led into one of the large lakes through which the river magdalena passes | there was some sea on the bar but not sufficient to make us hesitate to attempt it | on we pulled the water foaming and leaping up | as we approached the more dangerous part i saw my uncle looking astern at a large roller roaring up after us |  pull for your lives my lads | he shouted | the men gave way and though the water rushed over the quarter and half filled the boat the stern lifted and shooting forward in another minute we were on the calm surface of the lake | we pulled up keeping towards its western shore | it was fringed with a broad belt of mangrove trees standing on numberless branching roots which extended far into the water | so dense and tall were these trees that the view beyond them was completely shut out while not a spot of dry ground appeared which would have afforded us a landing place had we wished to get on shore | the scenery indeed was altogether unattractive and gloomy very different from that which i had expected to see | we had not gone far when the weather as the captain had predicted suddenly changed | dark clouds chased each other at a rapid rate across the hitherto blue sky the wind came in fitful gusts increasing every instant and the water before so calm rose in foaming waves with extraordinary suddenness the cause of which my uncle observed was the shallowness of the lake | still we continued our course hoping to get to the village of cervanos where we could procure a bongo or native canoe in which we could perform our voyage of eight hundred miles up the magdalena and where also should it as we hoped be in the hands of the republicans we might obtain the information we required to send back to the schooner | the fury of the wind which now shifting blew partly across and partly down the lake made it impossible for us to proceed in the direction we desired and an opening among the mangrove trees which my uncle hoped might prove the mouth of a stream appearing he steered towards it | scarcely had we got the boat's head round when the gale came down upon us with redoubled fury and sent her flying along with only two oars out at a furious speed | a small palm branch which floating by my uncle picked up was almost blown out of his hands as he held it in the air | we were fortunately right in conjecturing that we were entering the mouth of a stream so we went on some distance with unabated speed when a crash was heard and the water came rushing into the boat | we had run against a sunken log or projecting root | still we ran on while the man in the bows attempted to stop the leak with his jacket and the boat's sail and my uncle and i bailed as fast we could with our hats | every moment we expected the boat to fill but presently we saw a narrow opening through which we rushed with only space sufficient for the oars on each side to avoid the roots of the mangrove trees while the dense foliage formed a wall of verdure high above our heads | we had no provisions with us and we could not tell whether the region into which we were penetrating was inhabited by hostile indians or wild beasts and venomous serpents | after going some way however the stream widened and at the same time became shallower and the mangrove trees ceasing we found ourselves in the midst of a dense forest | looking out anxiously on both sides we observed a bank which would afford us a small space on which to land so pulling up to it we hurriedly sprang on shore | in spite of all our efforts the boat was nearly half full of water | our first care was to land our baggage and especially to keep our guns and ammunition dry | we then having piled our property together by our united efforts hauled up the boat and the extent of the damage she had received was soon discovered | a hole had been made through a plank a portion of which had also been ripped off | it was a wonder the boat had not filled and gone down | we had no tools not even a marling spike to serve as a hammer with which to repair her | the crew took the matter very coolly only observing that they wished they had some grog and grub |  i will try what i can do for you in the way of getting provisions said my uncle and i hope to be able to shoot some birds or an animal of some sort but in the meantime we must endeavour to repair the boat | we can draw some nails from the seats where they are of less consequence and we must cut some canvas out of the sail if we can find no plank to fasten over the hole | encouraged by my uncle the men set to work to draw some nails out of the stern sheets with their knives and we then managed to turn the boat over | the canvas alone it was evident would not keep the water out of the boat even though backed by a piece of one of the bottom boards which was broken off | my uncle however after examining the trees in the neighbourhood found a large one with a smooth bark in this he made a hole with one of the men's knives and immediately a thick white liquid issued from it | sending for the piece of canvas he allowed the liquid to flow over it till it had formed a thick hard cake |  now my lads he said stick that plaster over the hole and nail the board tightly over it | i will answer for it that no water gets through whatever it may do round the edges | the plan succeeded but still only the most foolhardy would have attempted to recross the bar in so unseaworthy a boat indeed with our baggage on board it was very doubtful whether we could accomplish the rest of our voyage in her | we had been so busily engaged in endeavouring to repair our boat that night came suddenly down on us before we were aware of its approach and we had no time to make preparations for encamping | fortunately however we had a tinder box and matches but it was difficult to collect fuel in the dark and we were afraid when groping about that we might put our hands on a venomous snake as we knew that such creatures usually abound in the forests on level ground near the water | i could not help recollecting the tales i had heard in my childhood from my good nurse josefa and i thought it more than probable that a jaguar or puma might attack us while asleep or an alligator come out of the stream and make his supper off one of us or that an anaconda might come crawling by and swallow the whole party at a gulp | still it was important that we should have a fire and my uncle suggested that we should kindle a small one the light from which would enable us to obtain fuel with greater ease | we followed his advice and in a short time had collected dried branches sufficient as we hoped to keep the fire burning during the night | the men then began to cry out for something to eat when uncle denis remembered that he had a tin of biscuits and a case of wine which he had brought for emergencies | we had a tin cup and a small breaker but the men supposing that they would not be long absent from the schooner had neglected to fill it with water while that in the stream as the tide was then rising was brackish | they continued grumbling for some time till uncle denis produced the biscuits and a bottle of wine which he divided among them and ourselves | our scanty supper being finished the men threw themselves down by the side of the fire hoping that the smoke would keep off the mosquitoes which swarmed round us in myriads |  hallo my lads | observed uncle denis you take things too easily | we must set a watch or our fire will go out and by the morning some one among us may have lost the number of his mess | this hint aroused them and they agreed that we should each keep watch for two hours at a time and draw lots who should keep the first watch | the lot fell upon me | so while the rest of the party lay down i stuck a brace of pistols in my belt took a fowling piece in my hand and prepared to do the duty of a sentry | the scene to me was strange and novel | the dark forest towering above our heads the flickering flames casting an uncertain light on the giant trunks and the tracery of sepos or twisting vines which interlaced the branches and hung down in festoons and ropelike lines to the ground along which they ran often assuming the appearance of huge serpents indeed more than once as i paced up and down i could not help fancying that an anaconda or boa constrictor or rattlesnake was creeping towards us | in the centre of the small open space was the fire with my companions sleeping round it near them the pile of baggage and the overturned boat while the dark stream flowed by with a murmuring sound | beyond though we were sheltered from the wind i could see the lofty summits of the trees waving in the gale which howled amid their branches making them rattle and creak while from the depths of the forest came strange unearthly cries | at first they seemed almost supernatural and a feeling of awe somewhat allied to alarm crept over me till i recollected that they were probably produced by howling monkeys and other wild animals | i kept as may be supposed a very sharp look out with my eyes constantly turned to one side or the other generally towards the forest | every now and then i threw a few sticks on the fire to keep up a bright blaze so that i might not be caught unawares | still every moment i half expected to see a jaguar or serpent or perhaps a band of wild indians creeping amid the trees towards us | all the time the detestable mosquitoes were buzzing about my head effectually preventing me from going to sleep and i wondered how my companions could contrive to do so | at length at the end of two hours my uncle awoke and told me to lie down | he was to take the next watch | i wrapped my face in a handkerchief and in spite of my apprehensions was soon fast asleep | when morning broke the gale was still blowing as hard as ever as we saw by the way the tree tops moved | we were unable therefore to continue our voyage | we could not help also feeling some anxiety about the fate of the schooner till the men observed that as the wind was off the shore she would probably have run out to sea or might have remained safely at anchor | matters were now growing unpleasant if not serious | my uncle told me that he was more apprehensive of an attack from indians than from wild beasts as a large and savage tribe the goahiras inhabited the whole region bordering the coast and should any wandering party discover us and suppose that we were republicans they would certainly attack us and put us to death as they had been induced to side with the spaniards | we accordingly launched our boat but found the water leak in so rapidly that it was evident it would not do to put the baggage on board till the last moment | as we had no more nails we could not expect effectually to stop the leak | we had now exhausted all the biscuits and were again very hungry | uncle denis and i accordingly took our fowling pieces and endeavoured to make our way through the forest in the hope of shooting some birds or monkeys indeed any creature with flesh on its bones would have been welcome | it was only with the greatest difficulty that we could advance even a few steps in consequence of the numberless creepers | now and then we caught a glimpse of gay plumaged birds amid the few openings between the branches but to shoot them was impossible and we heard the monkeys chattering and nuts and broken twigs came rattling down on our heads as the nimble creatures leaped from tree to tree | we dared not venture far into the forest for fear of losing our way besides which it was necessary to proceed very cautiously lest we should be surprised by a jaguar or tread on any venomous serpent | we neither of us at that time it must be remembered had any experience of tropical forests or we might have been more successful | at length we were making our way back to the river when just as we got in sight of it we heard a rustling among the foliage | my uncle signed to me to stop and i fully expected to see a jaguar springing towards us | he advanced cautiously a few paces then stopped a moment and fired | at the same instant i saw a good sized deer which had been going towards the water to drink | the animal made one spring and then fell over dead | with an exulting shout of satisfaction my uncle dashed forward and i followed him while the men hearing our voices came running up and quickly bore the deer to our camp | while uncle denis and i relighted our fire which had gone out the men skinned and cut up the animal and we soon had some slices roasting on forked sticks |  if we had had some nails this deer skin would have assisted famously to patch up our boat observed one of the men |  though we have no nails we may secure it under her bottom with ropes and perhaps it will answer as well said my uncle | his suggestion was acted on and again hauling up the boat we covered the hairy side of the skin thickly with mud and then lashed it to the bows bringing one end up above water | on once more launching the boat we found that the plan succeeded beyond our expectations but little water leaking in | our patience was still to be tried: as yet the gale gave no signs of abating | as we had a good supply of food we had no cause to complain except on account of the delay | no one expected us at cervanos and the captain of the schooner knew well that his boat could not cross the bar | our principal cause of anxiety was that the goahira indians might discover us and perhaps commence an attack before we had time to let them know that we were english | uncle denis thought it prudent therefore to reload the boat that we might be ready to shove off at a moment's notice | we accordingly prepared everything for a start but as the wind was still violent there was but little chance of our getting away that evening | we therefore before dark collected a good supply of fuel so that we had enough to maintain a blazing fire during the hours of darkness | every hour gave additional evidence that the gates of the continent were closing upon the english soldier | influence impression publicity were the prizes of a political career | i saw all other names fade before the great senatorial names of england | i saw men of humble extraction filling the world with their fame | i saw a succession of individuals who if their profession had been arms or if their birth place had been the continent would have lived and died in the routine of obscure service here rising to the height of national homage lustres of their generation and guiding by their opinions the courts of europe | whether i should ever take my place among those illustrious names scarcely entered into my thoughts | but i was determined never to waste my life in conscious indolence | scarcely knowing what faculties i might possess i had fully resolved on trying their utmost strength and grown almost indifferent to the ordinary pursuits of human indulgence i looked with something of a melancholy yet proud hope to the enjoyment which was to be found in giving myself up to the solitary and stern toil of living for a great cause and leaving a name behind me that should not be forgotten | on that very day the intelligence arrived that the british troops had marched towards the north of germany that the royal duke had returned to england and that the allies had by common consent abandoned the invasion of france | my habits were always prompt | before the hour was over in which the gazette appeared i waited on my ministerial friend and expressed my full acquiescence in his proposal | i pass by the process of getting into parliament | it was then a simpler matter than it has since become | a treasury borough was then the gate through which all the leading names of the country had entered the legislature and i merely followed the path of all but the lords of acres | every man who will make himself master of an occupation must serve an apprenticeship | they had got out the oars and i was in the act of stepping on board when a fearful yell rent the air | at the same moment a number of half naked savages armed with bows and spears tall feathers ornamenting their heads and the skins of wild beasts floating from their shoulders dashed out of the forest | my uncle took the helm and the seamen gave way with might and main | the current was strong and the savages had some distance to traverse before they could reach the margin of the stream | as they saw us escaping they let fly a shower of arrows but from the uncertain light for the dawn was only just breaking their aim was fortunately bad and by the time they reached the edge of the water we had got some way down the stream | we did not relax our exertions for they might possibly follow us along the banks and as the river took two or three turns cut us off at some narrow part | their arrows my uncle afterwards told me he believed were poisoned | the indians shot another flight several of which dropped unpleasantly close astern of us but they now saw that we were beyond their reach though their fierce shouts and cries still followed us | the wind had by this time completely fallen | we made rapid way down the stream happily escaping any sunken logs and once more saw the broad surface of the lake extended before us | still there was no time to be lost as the indians might possibly have canoes concealed along the banks and might follow us though unless they had the agility of monkeys there was little probability of their making their way among the mangrove trees |  if they do come we must try and keep them at bay observed my uncle |  none of them appear to have firearms and our guns will tell upon them before they can get us within reach of their arrows | the men having no wish to fight where nothing was to be gained pulled away as fast as they could lay their backs to the oars and we soon shot through the narrow opening and rounding the extreme point of the bay into which the stream emptied itself we steered for the village for which we were bound | we had a long pull before us but fortunately the deer skin kept the water out very well and we had only occasionally to bail to keep her clear | i could not refrain from giving a glance astern every now and then to ascertain if the indians were coming but we saw nothing more of them | we had brought away a supply of the cooked venison and after rowing some distance the oars were laid in and we turned to to breakfast | my uncle served out a cup of wine to each of the men it was the only liquid we had as the water of the lake was salt | we would gladly have exchanged the wine for a cup of tea or even fresh water as the rays of the sun striking down from a cloudless sky made us suffer greatly from thirst the men especially who had to row felt the want of water | we at length some time past noon came in sight of the village which stood close to the edge of the lake | part of it consisted of indian huts scattered about without much order | at the further end on slightly elevated ground was a sort of fortification surrounded by a mud wall with loopholes for musketry high palisades and a chevaux de frise while above it floated the republican flag | we saw sentries posted at each angle who were evidently keeping a sharp look out | we steered for a landing place under the fort | just before we reached it a large native boat which had apparently come down the stream had arrived and the passengers were landing from her | among them was a middle aged man from his complexion even when i saw him at a distance i guessed that he was a european | he stopped when he saw our boat touch the shore and came slowly forward eyeing us narrowly | the peculiarity of his features and costume and the thick stick he carried in his hand showed unmistakably that he was an irishman | he now stopped and looked first at my uncle and then at me then giving a flourish of his shillelagh and two or three wild leaps he shouted erin go bragh shure it's the young masther and misther denis themselves and no other and came bounding towards us | i at once recognised my father's faithful follower tim molloy who in spite of his age had lost none of his youthful spirits or activity |  shure it's wonderful isn't it misther denis that i should fall in with you the very moment i had come expecting to have to wait many a month maybe before my old eyes would be gladdened with the sight of you he exclaimed after we had got on shore |  and as the look of the place isn't altogether over pleasant shure you'll be willing to start away again up the river without spending any time down here | uncle denis said he should be ready to commence our voyage the following day but one as he hoped by that time to have got through some business he had to transact at cervanos on hearing which tim expressed his satisfaction | we immediately as may be supposed made inquiries about all at home |  as to health the masther and misthress and the childher are all mighty well replied tim and misthress nora is as bright and blooming as a may morning in the old country ' and as tall almost as you masther barry not a young lady in the land to equal her | and masther gerald is as fine a boy as you can set eyes on for his age in any part of the country: he can handle a rifle or paddle a canoe as well as any indian | and the rest who were mere babies when you went away are now grown into fine hearty childher | but to tell you the truth i would rather see the masther wear a more cheerful countenance than he does | he's throubled about the times which are unquiet enough it must be owned though we have never yet had a visit from the spanish troops it's more than we can say when they may be upon us | tim gave us much more information about the state of affairs at home than i need here repeat and answered numerous questions which uncle denis put to him after we had reached our quarters | we found about a hundred and fifty soldiers garrisoning the fort the commandant of which received us very civilly and offered us a room in the house he inhabited while tim took charge of our baggage and saw it safely stowed away | uncle denis wished to have the boat properly repaired before she returned although the crew declared that she was quite fit to make the passage back to the schooner | as soon as my uncle had gained the information he required and had written his despatches to the captain they put off with such provisions as we were able to obtain for them having also filled their breaker with water | whether they got back we could not ascertain but i know that the schooner landed her cargo which was much wanted by the patriots | it was not till long after this that i again heard of captain longswill when he rendered me an essential service as i shall narrate in due course | tim lost no time in seeking a boat and crew and making other preparations for our long river voyage | we spent the evening with the commandant who gave us many interesting accounts of the war which had long been raging in the country | on the whole the patriots had been successful though the forces of the king of spain were better drilled and were well supplied with arms and ammunition | the spaniards had also made an alliance with numerous indian tribes and by spreading among them false reports regarding the objects of the patriots the goahira indians whose territory was at no great distance from cervanos had been induced to side with the royalists | several severe encounters had already taken place between them and the patriots and it was expected that they would before long attack the fort itself | our friend the commandant described them as a peculiarly savage and warlike race possessing more than the usual intelligence of the native tribes and able to bring several thousand men into the field |  i hope that they may not be induced to attack cervanos observed my uncle though i doubt not that your soldiers would fight bravely it is but a small place to resist so powerful a force |  we shall give a good account of them if they venture to come answered the commandant gaily we fear neither them nor any troops the spaniards can bring against us | we have scouts out in all directions to give due notice of their approach and are not likely to be taken by surprise | some of the scouts are indians others sambos or whites but we depend most on the indians who know the habits of their people and are likely to bring us the most correct intelligence of their movements | after further conversation we retired to our room i cannot say to our couches for with the utmost wish to be hospitable the commandant could supply us with neither bedsteads nor bedding | our saddles which were to be used in our overland journey served us for pillows and some horse cloths and cloaks answered the purpose of mattresses and coverlets | notwithstanding this we should have slept soundly enough had it not been for the mosquitoes which hummed round our ears all night darting down and running their trunks into every spot they could find exposed | it was a severe lesson and reminded us that we must obtain mosquito curtains to surround out beds at night or we should be eaten up before we had performed half our voyage | chapter two | alligator or shark a shooting expedition we witness the death of a scout make our escape preparations for our voyage up the river night aroused by an attack on the fort indians enter it escape to the boat followed by the doctor voyage across the lakes camp on the shore of the lake the doctor shoots an alligator pursued by indians enter the magdalena beautiful scenery magnificent trees gay flowers gorgeous plumage of birds the doctor catches an alligator voyage continued mountains in sight a tempest at night end of voyage we part with the doctor | as soon as morning came i got up and sauntered out into the fort | the sentries were at their posts but no one else was astir | both within and without the fort a perfect silence reigned broken only now and then by the cries of water fowl as they rose from the bank or the screaming of parrots as they flew out of the neighbouring forest from whence also proceeded the suppressed chattering of a tribe of monkeys | i was on my way to the gate intending to go to the landing place and take a bath when a stranger approached me | he wore a large broad brimmed straw hat with a republican cockade a short tunic of blue and white striped cotton light blue trousers jack boots with immense spurs a long french dragoon sword with brass basket hilt fastened to his waist belt was dangling at his side while a powder horn was slung over his shoulders and he carried in his hand an enormous old french silver mounted gun | his hair was light and so would have been his complexion had it not been burned red by exposure to the hot sun of the tropics | his beard was carefully trimmed to a point | i may further say that he had prominent black eyes an aquiline nose of considerable dimensions a mouth not very small a long face with a sharp chin while i judged by his features that he was german | such i found was the case when he addressed me and introduced himself as dr rudolph stutterheim | after wishing me good morning he inquired where i was going | i told him |  then you will be gobbled up by either one alligator or one shark he replied for though the water is brackish the alligators come down here to pick up any morsels they can find and the sharks come for the same purpose | i thanked him for his warning but still felt rather doubtful if he was right | to convince me he procured two pieces of offal which he carried at the end of his stick and accompanied me down to the landing place a rough stone pier which projected into the lake | taking a piece he jerked it some distance into the water when in an instant a huge pair of jaws with rows of sharp teeth rose above the surface and snapped it up | he then took the other piece and threw it in an opposite direction when just as it reached the water another pair of jaws the lower part of silvery whiteness rose above the water and the meat was gone |  you see my young friend you can have your choice he said but i don't think you will wish just now to bathe in this place | i assured him i did not and he having lighted a big meerschaum pipe which he drew from his pocket we returned to the fort | i inquired whether he was the surgeon of the forces stationed there |  such an occupation would not suit my fancy he answered shrugging his shoulders though while i am here i willingly cooper up those who require my services | i am a traveller and naturalist desirous of seeing the country and the strange creatures it contains and in search of adventures which i may perhaps some day narrate for the enlightenment of the world | i of course replied that i hoped he would do so as i should like to read the work of one who had rendered me so essential a service and i added that i felt deeply grateful to him as he had certainly saved my life by preventing me from venturing into the water |  it was at no great cost to myself he answered but i should have grieved to see one so young swallowed by a saurian and who is at all events capable of becoming food for powder if for nothing else eh | what do you say my young friend | somewhat uncertain whether or not the doctor was quizzing me i replied that i hoped i might some day become fit for a better fate than he suggested |  yet such has been the lot of many a fine man with a head on his shoulders who has run it into a quarrel not his own he observed |  i know what war is a horrible detestable affair at the best | take my advice: have nothing to do with it | both parties now striving for the mastery are savages | you will find that out before long though do not tell the commandant what i say or he may chance to order me out to be shot as a traitor to the cause of liberty | bah there is only liberty where good laws exist which all obey | here the only laws obeyed are those administered at the point of the bayonet | but don't repeat this he added putting his finger to his lips and turning away | after parting from the doctor i returned to the house of the commandant whom with my uncle i found at breakfast | i at once made inquiries about my friend of the morning |  he is a wonderful man a genius a philosopher a professor of astrology a magician answered the commandant shrugging his shoulders |  more i cannot say he is a wonder a mystery but he understands the art of brewing punch to perfection and that is something in his favour | i had not long taken my seat when dr stutterheim appeared at the door | what  still at breakfast gentlemen | he exclaimed with a look of surprise |  you must have been up early to have had the advantage of us observed the commandant |  except in the matter of obtaining an appetite i cannot acknowledge that such is the case said the doctor advancing farther into the room towards a vacant chair |  sit down then said the commandant and satisfy your hunger my friend |  ten thousand thanks answered the doctor gliding into the chair |  as in duty bound i willingly obey your orders and he forthwith began shovelling scraped salt beef fried eggs and plantains of which our breakfast was composed at a rapid rate into his capacious mouth adding half a basketful of tropical fruits and washing the whole down with a bowl of thick chocolate |  i follow the advice of a great philosopher who insists that no men can be considered wise who fail when they have an opportunity early in the day to lay in a store of provision lest they should be unable to secure a further supply he observed | turning to my uncle he inquired whether he purposed remaining any length of time at cervanos and on hearing that he did not intend to start till the following morning invited me to accompany him on a shooting excursion along the shores of the lake |  i go for two reasons he said: to increase my knowledge of the natural history of the country and likewise to fill my pot | senor commandante i shall have the honour of presenting you with the result of our sport | i was naturally eager to accept the invitation of my new friend and my uncle making no objections i agreed to accompany him | after smoking his meerschaum for the best part of an hour he declared himself ready to start | when i went to get my gun tim said that he would go too not that he distrusted the doctor but that as i was unaccustomed to sporting in that region he might assist me | i might by chance be pounced upon by a jaguar or should i venture into the water in search of wild fowl be carried off by an alligator | we at once set out with our guns and game bags accompanied by the doctor's dog jumbo who was almost as curious looking as was his master a perfect nondescript but the doctor boasted that he had not his equal was afraid of neither quadruped nor biped and would face a jaguar a bear or a tamanoir the large ant eater while he would stand to his point till he died of starvation provided the bird chose to stay and be pointed at | we were now to try his powers | we had intended to go along the bank of the lake for the sake of more easily finding our way back but the ground was so marshy that we were compelled to strike inland | we were tolerably successful having before long killed seven large birds of the plover species two ground doves of a beautiful plumage three parrots and a monkey which the doctor said he preferred to any members of the feathered tribe | we were making our way through the forest when between the trunks of the tall trees i saw tim who was some distance ahead turn round and make a sign to us | it seemed to me that he intended to signify that we should go back but instead of doing so the doctor advanced treading very cautiously and making jumbo follow at his heels | tim put his finger to his lips to indicate that we must keep silence while he pointed ahead | in front of us was a thick low mass of wood over a portion of which we could look our heads being concealed by the branches above it and we soon saw what had caused his anxiety | at some distance in an open spot of uneven ground with their backs turned towards us were a party of indians armed with bows and arrows while farther on at a distance of thirty yards or so was a single indian bound by his arms to the trunk of a tree and in front of him several indian squaws their eyes intently fixed on his countenance | i felt my blood freeze in my veins as i observed what was about to take place for of their intentions there could be no doubt they were on the point of putting to death the unfortunate man bound to the tree | to interfere would have been madness it was a question indeed whether we could retreat without being discovered | still we stood rivetted to the spot | tim made signs that he knew the man and whispered in my ear that he was one of the indian spies who had been sent out from the fort to gain intelligence and had now fallen into the hands of the goahiras | not a sound did he utter but with indian stoicism prepared to meet his fate | all hope of escape must have deserted him | the indians stood watching him to see if he would show any sign of fear while the squaws advanced closer and closer shrieking and jeering and making hideous faces to induce him to speak | at length three of the indians stepped before the rest and in an instant one shot his arrow which went quivering into the breast of the victim | still the man did not utter a cry | after waiting a minute another shot an arrow which also pierced the body of the unhappy wretch | after a third shot i saw that he was still alive | the first indians now retired to the main body when i heard a groan escape from the scout's tortured frame on which the squaws set up a loud jeering laugh | the doctor who had with difficulty been able to keep back jumbo now began carefully to retreat beckoning to tim and me to do likewise | it was the best opportunity while the savages were engaged in their butchery | still i much regretted that we had not boldly rushed forward and endeavoured to save the man's life | we might by surprising the indians have succeeded as they would probably have fancied that we were followed by a larger party and have taken to flight | we continued our course without speaking carefully endeavouring to make no noise and as rapidly and cautiously as possible | the doctor led the way taking huge strides over the ground i followed and tim brought up the rear | not for an instant did he stop to say a word even after we had got to a considerable distance and our voices could not possibly have been heard by the foe | i had great difficulty in keeping up with him at the rate he went but not till we got within sight of the fort did he slacken his pace and allow me to come up with him | i then told him that i wished we had tried to save the scout |  we should probably have had our scalps hanging at the end of their spears long ere this had we made the attempt he answered you've run a narrow chance a second time this day of losing your life young gentleman and you should be thankful | it is as well however that we caught sight of the indians depend on it they are in force at no great distance and we may expect an attack from them before many days are over perhaps before many hours are past and we must lose no time in warning the commandant | on entering the fort the commandant who happened to be near the gate and saw our game bags full greeted us warmly and invited the doctor to dinner |  very happy to do myself that honour he answered |  and perhaps senor commandante you will allow me to present you with these birds some of which it may be as well to cook forthwith and in the meantime i will relate to you our adventures and you can form your own conclusion | the doctor then described our having seen the scout shot by the indians and expressed his belief that the place would be attacked ere long | the commandant took the information very coolly | he prided himself i observed on his dignified behaviour on all occasions for though he had joined the republicans he could still boast that the bluest of blue blood of the ancient hidalgoes of castille flowed in his veins |  care shall be taken that the sentries keep their eyes open he replied and we will be prepared for the savages | the news we brought very soon spread through the fort and i observed that the sentries were doubled but otherwise the people occupied themselves as before in smoking gambling and cock fighting which seemed especially to interest all classes | my uncle listened attentively to the account i gave him |  possibly the enemy may not approach the fort for several days and we shall lose the opportunity of assisting to defend it for i cannot possibly delay beyond to morrow he remarked |  i hope however that our friends will be successful | my uncle had made arrangements i found for starting at daybreak the next morning and tim was busily employed in getting the bongo the boat we had engaged ready for the voyage and having our luggage conveyed on board | finding that we were really about to start the doctor asked leave to accompany us a part of the distance observing that he liked good society and that he hoped by his agreeable conversation to repay us for our kindness | tim had procured some mosquito curtains which we were to take with us on our voyage when we should require them even more than at cervanos | we accordingly lay down within them at an early hour | it was pleasant to hear our abominable tormentors of the previous night humming about outside and trying in vain to get at us but we had to be very quick in closing the opening or a host would otherwise have made their way in in spite of us | having wished my uncle good night and ascertained that not a living mosquito was inside the curtain i closed my eyes and was in another instant asleep | tim was to call us half an hour before daybreak that we might take some chocolate before starting | i had been asleep for some time when i was awakened by the report of a musket rapidly followed by several others and the next instant the air was rent by the most terrific shrieks and yells which seemed to come from all directions round the fort while the voices of the officers shouting out their orders and the tramp of the soldiers were heard as they rushed to the ramparts |  what can be the matter | i exclaimed as i crept from under my mosquito curtain |  the fort has been attacked and i much fear that the sentries have been surprised answered my uncle who had at the same instant jumped up and was hurriedly putting on his clothes | i followed his example and we were thus engaged when tim burst into the room |  quick quick masther concannan quick masther barry dear | and just come along with me he exclaimed |  there's not a moment to be lost the indians are getting the best of it and climbing over the walls in thousands like so many imps and the soldiers do all they can can't stop them |  we must go and assist our friends cried my uncle buckling on his sword and seizing his rifle |  oh masther denis now don't exclaimed tim you'll be kilt entirely if you do that same | come with me now it's all up with the garrison but we may have still time to get on board the boat and shove off into the lake | it's wiser to live and fight another day than get knocked on the head by an indian tomahawk and that's sure to be the lot of one and all of us if we stop | tim wrung his hands and leaped about in his agitation while speaking and then apparently doubting whether his arguments would prevail with my uncle he seized my arm with one hand while he picked up my gun and various other articles with the other and dragged me along determined at all events to try and save my life though he might not induce my uncle to make his escape | the din had by this time greatly increased the roar of the heavy guns the rattle of musketry and the clashing of steel were heard amid the shrieks and shouts of the combatants | at first the reports of firearms gave me hope that the garrison were driving back their assailants but suddenly the sound of the musketry ceased | looking back i was thankful to see my uncle following carrying his portmanteau on his shoulder and my carpet bag in his hand | tim took the way to the part of the fortifications nearest the landing place | we quickly scrambled over the intrenchments and my uncle throwing his burdens to us speedily followed | it was the only spot not assailed by the indians for what reason i could not tell as they might have got in with little more difficulty than we had found in getting out | the triumphant yells of the indians and the shrieks of the hapless garrison sounding in our ears showed us too plainly what would have been the consequence of delay | we rushed down to the landing place and reached it just at the moment when the terrified crew of the bongo were shoving off intending to leave us to our fate | tim springing forward seized the gunwale of the boat and hauled her back tumbling me in with an energy which almost sent me over on the other side |  jump in masther denis jump in here come a whole host of indians he exclaimed and they'll be after scalping every mother's son of us if we stop a moment longer | my uncle sprang into the boat and tim following was giving her a shove off when as i gazed through the darkness i saw a number of figures brandishing their tomahawks and rushing towards us | in front of them came a person evidently flying for his life |  stop my friends stop he cried out or the fellows at my heels will have me scalped | i recognised the voice of dr stutterheim | he sprang after us but his foot failing to reach the boat heavily laden as he was with his gun and various articles he fell into the water | tim however leant over the bows and caught his hand before he sank: and my uncle and i assisting we hauled him with all his traps on board while the crew were paddling with might and main to escape from his pursuers who in another minute would have been up with us | the doctor was too much exhausted to speak and threw himself down in the bottom of the boat | before the indians had time to stop and draw their bows we were some distance from the shore but that another minute's delay would have been fatal was proved by the flight of arrows which followed us | our black brown and swarthy rowers however did not cease their exertions till we had got far enough off to be invisible from the shore | my uncle now gave the crew orders to cease paddling that he might judge from the sounds what was taking place in the fort | musketry shots were still heard and the roar from several heavy guns proved that the garrison were still holding out in some part of the fort the war whoops of the indians which continually rent the air giving us hopes that though fighting desperately they had not succeeded in mastering the place | my uncle expressed his regret that he had come away so suddenly and feared that he should be accused of cowardice in not having afforded more assistance to his friends |  set your mind at rest on that score observed the doctor had you remained you would now have been numbered with the dead | depend on it the garrison have retreated to the citadel and are there holding out but as no reinforcements are likely to appear they must ultimately yield and be cut to pieces which is sure to be their fate as no one in this war thinks of asking or giving quarter | we may then congratulate ourselves on our escape |  this is the third time young gentleman in as many days that you have run the risk of losing your life he observed turning to me | i acknowledged that he was right and felt that i ought to return thanks to heaven for my having been so mercifully preserved | still my uncle wished to go back but the crew positively refused to obey him tim and the doctor siding with them |  let us be wise mr concannan observed the latter it is useless running our noses into danger when it can be avoided | and even if we were to go back we could not save the lives of the commandant and the garrison | let us console ourselves with the reflection that should they be killed they have died doing their duty | at length my uncle yielded to the doctor's advice and directed the crew to paddle on towards the upper part of the lake | as there were several narrow passages to be passed leading from one lake into another it was important that we should get through them before the indians could reach the shore whence they could pick us off with their arrows | it was satisfactory to know that they had no canoes in which to follow us else our chances of escape would have been small indeed | it was still dark when we reached the first passage | not a word was spoken and we hoped even if our enemies were on the shore that we should get through without being perceived | still i could not help keeping an anxious watch on the banks expecting every instant to see a party of indians start out from behind the trees and send a flight of arrows after us | i breathed more freely when emerging from the channel we were once more making our way across a broad expanse | here daylight burst on us | there would probably be less risk in passing the next channel as the indians would not have had time to get so far from cervanos but it was possible that a party might have been despatched before the attack was made to prevent any boats going up or down | still as our four guns would hold in check a strong party armed only with bows and arrows we had not much cause to fear | the crew laid in their paddles to breakfast that they might paddle with greater vigour through the channel and we at the same time took our morning meal washing it down with some water from the lake which was here perfectly fresh | while i was dipping my cup in the water a long dark snout darted towards it and i had barely time to withdraw my hand letting the cup slip when a pair of hideous jaws closed on it | they were those of a monstrous alligator | a blow from a paddle and the shouts of the men made the brute disappear but i took good care not again to put my hand overboard while the boat was motionless | several others rose a few feet from us though none came so near the boat as the first had done and as soon as the men began to move their paddles the monsters who are arrant cowards kept their distance | a short time after this we entered the channel leading to a yet more southern lake | we eagerly peered among the trees on both sides but no indians could be seen so we had reason to hope that we had completely distanced them | among the numberless shrubs which adorned the shores were wild plantains and fig trees decked with flowers of brilliant and beautiful colours which grew on the creepers festooning the boughs and often hanging down in long lines into the water | birds of all sorts and of magnificent plumage flew amid the branches or stood on the fallen trunks floating near the margin beautiful milk white herons scarlet spoonbills flamingoes and various other water fowl | we were paddling on when i caught sight of several figures moving among the trees |  are those indians | i exclaimed getting my gun ready to fire should they prove to be enemies |  save your powdher masther barry answered tim shure they're only monkeys | we shall hear them howling loud enough at night time you might then fancy that they were a whole troop of indians coming down to scalp us | the animals at which we were looking were of considerable size with a reddish tinge on their rough hair | the spaniards called them monas coloradas but they are generally known as howling monkeys | we saw many more among the trees as we paddled forward | having performed a long distance before night approached it was considered that we might with safety land and sleep on shore our bongo affording us no room to stretch our legs | we accordingly landed at the end of a canal through which we had been passing and a space was quickly cleared for an encampment | having the channel on one side and the lake on the other we had only two sides to guard | a fire was soon lighted and tim set to work to cook our supper while we put up our mosquito curtains and collected some dry leaves to form our couches | the mosquito curtains i should say were supported on four short poles stuck in the ground on which rested four others so that the whole arrangement looked like a long narrow box covered with fine muslin | without these contrivances it is utterly impossible to sleep with any degree of comfort on the banks of the magdalena or indeed of most of the rivers in that part of the country | there is only one opening through which the person must creep and then close it tightly on the inside | to prevent surprise we agreed to keep a vigilant watch | the first turn fell to me | i wondered that anybody could go to sleep with the terrific noises which came out of the forest | the howling monkeys were the most vociferous now uttering loud groans now yells of laughter and other strange sounds truly making night hideous | nearer at hand i could hear the alligators snapping their jaws as they caught some unfortunate fish or wild fowl while their snorts as they chased each other came from all sides | i kept my eye on the bank for i had heard that the savage creatures often climb out of the water and carry away the first person they can find | the doctor's dog seemed to be well aware of this for he crouched down close to the fire with one of his eyes always open either at the water or towards the forest from whence a jaguar might spring and carry him off | i soon got accustomed to the sounds of the howling monkeys the cries of the night birds and any other noises which came out of the forest but i never could feel comfortable while i heard that horrible snapping and crunching made by the alligators | while on the watch there was no chance of becoming drowsy for the mosquitoes all the time made the most determined assaults on my face and i had to keep my handkerchief constantly on the move to prevent them from settling | fortunately they cannot bite till then but when once they have settled it is better to allow them to suck their fill for otherwise the inflammation is far worse | the doctor was to follow me so after two hours i called him and remarked on the number of alligators i had heard near us |  to morrow morning we will put a stop to the snapping of some of them he answered |  i shall awake before dawn as i always do and will call you if you wish to exercise your skill on some of them | i begged that he would do so and having placed my gun safely under the curtains i crept in and closed them | two or three mosquitoes had managed to follow me but the light from the fire streaming through enabled me to catch them and kill them and in a few moments i was fast asleep | i felt unwilling to get up when i heard the doctor's voice till i remembered that we were to make war on the alligators | the feeling of utter detestation with which those creatures are regarded is not surprising when it is recollected what a scourge they are to the people inhabiting the banks of the rivers and lakes of that part of the country | i was soon on foot and having loaded my gun with ball i accompanied the doctor to a little creek which ran at no great distance from the camp | jumbo went with us | he knew exactly what to do | first he went to the shore of the lake and barked several times then ran along barking occasionally till he reached the entrance of the creek along the bank of which he ran | soon after he barked several long snouts appeared above the surface but jumbo was wide awake never for a moment withdrawing his eyes from the water so that should an alligator make a dash at him he might bound off out of harm's way | after some time we saw a huge monster appear who quickly put the other alligators to flight and then came swimming up the creek towards jumbo | the dog barked and then bounded off close to where the doctor and i lay hid | once more jumbo showed his nose among the weeds when the alligator opening his immense jaws made a dash at him | at the same moment the doctor starting up fired down the creature's throat and stopped him in mid career | his head and shoulders rose above the surface and then he rolled over dead | i shouted with satisfaction and jumbo barked his approval |  we have not yet finished our sport said the doctor we must kill half a dozen before breakfast | go good jumbo and entice a few more up here | jumbo understood his master and was proceeding to execute his orders when we heard my uncle's voice shouting to us to return in tones which showed that he had good reason for doing so | making our way through the tangled forest we soon reached the camp where we found every one astir our mosquito curtains and sleeping rugs packed up and the men busy loading the boat |  jump on board and i'll tell you all about it afterwards said my uncle | we obeyed him jumbo leaping in after us when the men shoving the boat off with their poles began to paddle rapidly across the lake |  i will now tell you the reason why i was in a hurry to be off said my uncle |  one of our crew choco a quick witted fellow going to the further end of yonder point observed a canoe with several indians in her coming along the canal | as soon as they saw him they paddled back at a rapid rate but he was convinced that the canoe was one of several in pursuit of us and that the indians have gone back to summon their companions believing that they will find us sitting at breakfast | he may have been mistaken but discretion is the better part of valour and though we might beat them off it would be unwise to run the risk of a fight when it can be avoided |  you are a wise man mr concannan observed the doctor |  why should people spend their lives in fighting when they would be so much happier living at peace with each other | it appears to me that the world is full of great fools and that they are its rulers |  i hope you don't include us in the category | said my uncle |  if one set of people will attack another what are the peaceably disposed to do |  they must fight to defend themselves i own answered the doctor and that proves to me that the fools rule the world for they compel the wise who must of necessity love peace to go to war | the world will never be at rest till not only the great majority but the whole have become wise and as i never expect to see that i believe it will continue to the end the same troublous unhappy world it is | the doctor i thought took matters very coolly | i very frequently looked out astern expecting to see a fleet of canoes full of indian warriors emerging from the canal but as none appeared i began to suppose that senor choco had made a mistake | we had still another narrow passage or canal to pass through before we could enter the main branch of the river and the doctor urged the men to make good speed across the lake as he was excessively hungry and wanted his breakfast | he amused us in the meantime by recounting some of his adventures with alligators | he had the most unbounded antipathy towards the monsters which arose he said from once seeing a poor girl who was stooping down to fill her pitcher with water at a river's brink seized by one of them | the horrible saurian darting out of the water and grasping her arm dragged her off before he could go to her rescue | he fired but his bullet glanced off the scaly head of the creature which in an instant carried the unfortunate female who was shrieking loudly under the surface |  there lay her pitcher on the river's brink said the doctor but she whom i had just before seen full of health and strength and singing gleefully was nowhere visible | i thereupon vowed vengeance against the whole race and have never lost an opportunity of slaughtering them | the alligators and jaguars the doctor told us are mortal enemies | the latter wages perpetual war against the former | whenever a jaguar can find an alligator asleep on a hot sand bank it attacks the saurian under the tail which being soft and fat is the most vulnerable part and such is the alligator's alarm that it will scarcely move or make the slightest resistance | if however it gets its enemy into the water its more peculiar element then the tables are turned and the jaguar is in most instances drowned and devoured | the jaguar being well aware of its inferiority to the saurian in the proper element of the latter when it has to cross a river it sets up a tremendous howl on the bank previous to entering the water in the hope of scaring the alligator to a distance | the native villages on the banks of a river in which alligators abound are guarded by strong palisades to prevent the monsters from creeping on shore which they will frequently do when pressed by hunger and will carry off any persons or animals they may encounter | an alligator has been known to dash into the midst of a crowd collected on the shore and carry off a strong man in spite of every effort made to rescue the poor fellow | scarcely a year passes in the neighbourhood of places frequented by them without two or three women being thus destroyed | the doctor mentioned a remarkable instance of intrepidity and presence of mind exhibited by a young girl who on going to the margin of the river to fetch water felt one of her hands suddenly seized in the jaws of a huge alligator | knowing that death must be her inevitable fate should she not find means to rescue herself she plunged her fingers into the eyes of the animal with such violence that the pain compelled it to let her go though not however till it had bitten off the lower part of her arm | notwithstanding the enormous quantity of blood which flowed from the fearful wound the girl struck out swimming with the hand that still remained to her and happily reached the shore where her friends received her and her wound being bound up and the flow of blood stopped she ultimately recovered | alligators swim rapidly against the strongest current and when they reach the shore they dart forward with the quickness of an arrow towards the object at which they aim when excited either by rage or hunger | though it generally moves in a straight line it can change its direction both in the water and on shore |  jumbo there hates alligators as much as i do continued the doctor |  he was once very nearly caught by one but he knows the ways of the hateful creatures | i was crossing a river in a canoe when he unwisely took to the water | i had reached the shore when i saw a huge alligator swimming towards him | jumbo saw it too and made way down the stream the alligator following and rapidly gaining on him | in an instant i thought my poor dog would be in the creature's jaws when jumbo suddenly turned and made way up the stream | it took the alligator a considerable time to come about and before it was able to dart forward towards its expected prey jumbo had safely reached the shore | the doctor declared that the female alligator at the period of hatching her eggs devours all her young ones which do not run into the river the immediate use of their legs being the only means of saving their lives |  i cannot fancy such monsters having any maternal affection i exclaimed | these and similar anecdotes occupied the time we took in crossing the lake | we now entered the last channel which was to conduct us into the magdalena | lofty trees grew on both sides of the channel among which we saw numerous large green parrots and several kinds of monkeys the howling species being the most numerous | there were also some large birds which stood looking at us and which the doctor called vultures of the lake | they had long red and very strong legs with their backs and breasts black and grey and curved spurs sharp at the point and about an inch in length on the first joint of each wing | as we had seen nothing of our supposed enemies the indians the crew declared that they were too hungry to proceed farther without breakfasting and a tolerably open space between the trees affording us room to light a fire we landed and having cleared the ground soon had our pots boiling | our crew put all their food consisting of rice plantain and salt beef into one large pot and boiled them together | the mess was then emptied out into wooden basins from which they fed themselves with their fingers long cakes of sugar serving as dessert | by the doctor's advice we imitated their example in one respect by boiling fowls ham vegetables and flour together which when well seasoned made an excellent dish only we made use of spoons and knives and forks to eat it | after the meal was finished the men lay on the ground to rest while the doctor produced his huge meerschaum and commenced smoking surrounding his visage with such dense clouds that not a mosquito ventured to approach him while my uncle and i had to keep our handkerchiefs moving rapidly to drive off the detestable little insects | we were thus enjoying ourselves if enjoyment it could be called when looking along the channel in the direction we had come i caught sight of the bow of a canoe just rounding a point |  on board on board | shouted the padrone or captain and the men jumping up tumbled the cooking things pots and pans into the boat tim following with our breakfast set which he had just before packed up | on our taking our seats the crew shoved off and began to paddle at a rapid rate up the stream | the canoe we had seen had now come full into view and at first appeared to be gaining on us | this made our padrone excite his men to fresh exertions | should our pursuer be an enemy and overtake us they would as certainly be put to death as we should supposing that we were unable effectually to defend ourselves | we got our firearms ready however having no intention of yielding as long as we were able to resist and the doctor having put fresh powder into the pan of his rifle now knelt down in the stern of the boat prepared to take good aim should our pursuers exhibit any hostile intentions |  why doctor i thought you said just now that only fools were eager to fight i could not help observing |  and you are right young gentleman he answered |  i am only preparing to defend myself and i hope that the people in yonder canoe will have the wisdom not to attack us | still in case they should do so we should lack wisdom if we were not prepared for their reception | while the doctor was speaking i was watching the canoe which was now joined by several others but for some reason or other the fastest remained for the slower ones and thus we managed to keep well ahead | the water hissed and bubbled under the bows as our boat clove her way through it | my uncle sat as calm as usual and had i judged by his countenance i should not have supposed that we were in the slightest danger | the captain and crew however showed by their eagerness that they were very unwilling to be overtaken while the doctor in spite of his professed pacific feelings was full of fight and prepared for the worst | such good use did the crew make of their paddles however that on seeing that we were distancing them our pursuers began to shout and shriek from disappointment as we supposed | but their cries only made our men redouble their efforts and utter every now and then a derisive shout in return | it was echoed by the chattering of the monkeys and the loud squalls of the parrots from the neighbouring woods jumbo occasionally adding to the chorus by barking furiously | at length on rounding a point we lost sight of the hostile canoes but our men did not relax their efforts for we expected them every instant to reappear | i kept watching the point but no canoe could be discovered coming round it so i began to hope that the indians had given up the chase | our men behaved admirably and not for a moment did they complain of the severe exertion they were going through | still we were too well acquainted with the treacherous character of the indians not to know that they might very possibly keep out of sight to deceive us and then come on during the night in the expectation of finding us encamped on shore and thus take us by surprise | this neither my uncle nor the doctor had any intention of allowing them to do and by promising a reward to the crew my uncle induced them to continue paddling on as fast as at first | they shouted after their fashion when emerging from the narrow channel we entered the broad waters of the magdalena | a breeze was setting up the stream the mast was now stepped and the sail hoisted and along we flew at a rapid rate | we had no longer any fear of being overtaken though we knew that we had many dangers to encounter on the voyage | the inhabitants of the banks were generally in favour of the republican cause but we might possibly unless we took care land at a spot occupied by spanish troops or by indians fighting for the king of spain | i must pass rapidly over our river voyage interesting as it was | the banks were in numerous places exceedingly beautiful from the profusion of scarlet and lilac coloured flowers of the convolvulus kind which covered the trees and bushes some growing on them others the produce of the numberless creepers which hang to the boughs | in some places we saw the wild cotton tree hanging over the banks of the river with pods full of cotton ripe and bursting | among other creepers was the vanilla entwining itself round the trees and producing a pleasing effect | the doctor told me that it is used as a spice to flavour chocolate and various dishes | after sailing on for some days we came to a part of the river full of islands covered with lofty trees and a variety of shrubs the mimosa being among the most beautiful | of the many creepers we observed one called the bejuco is so strong and tough that the natives use it to fasten together the rafters of their houses and the bamboos forming the covering of the long flat bottomed boats called champans with which they navigate the upper part of the river magdalena | birds of all kinds of the most gorgeous plumage flitted among the trees or flew over our heads large scarlet macaws in great numbers two and two went squalling by their brilliant plumage shining in the bright sun large black wild turkeys occupied the lower branches of the trees | we frequently saw the scarlet heads of the macaws peeping out of holes in the trees in which they make their nests while flights of gaily coloured parrots and green parrakeets were flying backwards and forwards across the river | small fish too were in such vast shoals in the shallows that the bongo appeared in one place to cut through them | the finny tribe must however enjoy a hazardous existence for close to the spot we counted no less than thirty alligators swimming within a few hundred yards of our boat their heads generally appearing only above water and we frequently saw the fish leaping above the surface evidently endeavouring to escape from their persecutors | on several occasions we saw the monsters' carcasses lying on the banks probably killed by the jaguars | some were reduced to perfect skeletons every particle of flesh having been eaten off by armadilloes or ants | at one of the villages where we landed we found a poor mulatto woman in great tribulation and on our inquiring what was the matter she told us that her daughter had that morning been seized by an alligator while in the act of filling her pitcher in the river and carried away | the rest of the villagers were also in a state of alarm as they declared that the alligators when once they have tasted human flesh become particularly fond of it and are especially bold and fierce in their attacks on people approaching their haunts |  i will try what i can do for you said the doctor |  i have been sent opportunely to your relief | know me as the renowned slayer of caymans | the villagers on this gazed on him with great respect and eagerly showed him the part of the river frequented by their foe | obtaining a bar of iron about a foot and a half in length the ends sharply pointed he fixed it in a float which he surrounded with a large mass of putrid pork | this he fastened to a long rope the part nearest the bait being of an open texture which the alligator's teeth could not bite through | the bait was allowed to float off into the river while the end of the rope was secured to the trunk of a tree | jumbo was then sent to bark along the bank of the river in order to attract the monster | its snout before long appeared above the surface when jumbo aware of the rush it would make scampered off up the steep bank to a safe distance | the sagacious dog knew well the danger of manoeuvring on ground raised only a little above the level of the water for the alligator could easily land and make its way over it with great speed | the monster disappointed in obtaining the delicate morsel jumbo would have afforded at last caught sight of the bait and making a dash at it immediately found its jaws pierced by the iron spike and began to haul away at the rope with a force which threatened to snap it if it did not pull down the tree | the doctor now called the villagers and ordered them to haul away at the rope | at first they seemed very unwilling to undertake the task but we setting them the example they laid hold of it and casting the end loose from the tree hauled away lustily | in spite of its struggles the vast monster was dragged up to the bank and feeling its feet touch the shore it made the most terrific efforts to back off | the men hauled away with such good will that it was compelled to move along the ground for some distance on its knees | suddenly getting on its feet however it made a desperate rush at its captors |  pull away | pull away | shouted the doctor who was prepared for the emergency and the villagers pulled with all their might till two or three tumbling down the rest scampered off | my uncle tim and i had sprung on one side and got ready our rifles but before we could fire the monster would have been upon the fallen men when the doctor stepping forward fired his rifle almost down its throat | it instantly stopped and after another attempt to dash forward fell over on its side | the villagers on this slackened the rope when the creature recovering made another desperate attempt to reach them |  pull ye villains pull | shouted tim his words being echoed by the doctor who in his excitement as another great naturalist asserts that he himself did leaped on the alligator's back and flourished his rifle which he had reloaded above his head then quickly lowering it he presented it towards the creature's ear | the natives now emboldened by witnessing his performance hauled away as he directed them | the wounded alligator was evidently becoming weaker and the doctor fearing that it might roll over him and finding his seat not the most comfortable in the world leaped off then running some way ahead he again fired into the creature's mouth | the last shot proved an effectual quietus to the saurian which after making a few convulsive struggles rolled over and lay perfectly still | the natives on seeing their enemy dead shouted and danced with delight and insisted on carrying us all back on their shoulders to the village in triumph | they told us that the monster had already carried off several dogs which had gone down to the water to drink | they urged us to remain that we might kill a few more alligators and were much disappointed when we told them that we were compelled to continue our voyage | as we frequently had to bring up sometimes before dark we had opportunities of shooting a variety of birds and animals in the forest | the doctor killed several monkeys one a large red fellow with a beard as long and rough as that of a capuchin friar and several others of a smaller species one called the titti a pretty little creature with a grey back and chocolate coloured breast the face without any hair | i was sorry to see the small creature put to death it seemed like unnecessary cruelty but the doctor did not participate in my feelings and i must confess that the monkey made an excellent fricassee | we generally spent our nights on the dry sandbanks | at first i was under the unpleasant apprehension that we might be attacked by alligators but we were assured that they seldom come out of the water at night and unless very hungry are not likely to carry anybody off | among other valuable vegetable productions of the country we saw the guava tree from the fruit of which the jelly of that name is made | at last we arrived at the town of mompox which we happily found in the hands of the republicans | we had here to exchange our bongo for a flat bottomed boat called a champan with which alone the upper part of the river can from its numerous shallows be navigated | it is exactly the same in shape and construction as the boats made by the indians before the conquest of the country by the spaniards | they are of all sizes | a large one costs a considerable sum as much we were told as three thousand dollars | the larger are about sixty feet in length by seven feet in beam and the gunwale is two feet from the water's edge | in the centre is a cabin with a convex roof between six and seven feet high made of strong and flexible bamboos covered with palm leaves and fastened together with the bejuco the creeper i have before described | the crew consists of a padrone or captain a pilot who steers with a large paddle and about twenty two men who urge the boat on with long poles some standing in the bow and others on the top of the cabin | the champan we engaged however was of a much smaller size | the news we received at mompox that the spanish forces were moving out of the fortified towns they had for some time occupied and were traversing the country made my uncle anxious to continue our voyage | we passed several plantations of the cocoa tree from the seed of which chocolate is made | the cocoa pod resembles a small rough melon and is of a dark red colour full of small beans | we had now in view in the distance ranges of mountains which appeared to be of vast height a sign that we were approaching a region very different from that which we had hitherto traversed | the second or third night of our voyage in the champan we brought up alongside a narrow sand bank backed by lofty trees and after we had lighted our fire and just as we were preparing for our evening meal on looking up i saw a number of comical little faces grinning down upon us | as we did not move their monkey owners became bolder and advanced towards the ends of the boughs playing all sorts of gambols such as hanging by their tails and swinging backwards and forwards | many of them had young ones on their backs who in spite of the leaps made by their parents clung fast even when they were swinging by their tails with their heads downwards | an old monkey led the way followed by the others with flankers and a rear guard | sometimes as a variety they played a regular game of follow the leader and amused us much | they were succeeded by vast flights of parrots and parrakeets which came to rest in couples on some wild fig trees which grew near and indulged in a vociferous concert till the shades of night crept over the river | at times the air was full of them coming from all directions but notwithstanding the din they made we allowed them to enjoy their repose undisturbed | as the interior of the toldo or cabin of the champan was excessively close and infested by mosquitoes we formed a sort of tent of the boat's sail which we stretched on four uprights leaving room below for the air to circulate | under this covering we spread our bedding trusting to the bogos as the boatmen are called to keep a proper watch and still more to the vigilance of the doctor's dog jumbo who always lay at his master's feet | we had been so accustomed to hear of alligators jaguars and huge serpents without having hitherto suffered from them that all anxiety on the subject had vanished | when we went out shooting in the woods we of course kept a sharp look out on either side and took care where we stepped that we might not be putting our feet on a venomous serpent or allow a jaguar to steal towards us unperceived and as for the alligators we had arrived at the opinion that they had more to fear from us than we from them | thus we were all sleeping tranquilly that night when about four or five hours after sunset i was startled by a bright light which i saw through my closed eyelids followed almost immediately by a tremendous roar which seemed to shake the very earth |  what's the matter | i shouted out starting to my feet scarcely understanding what was about to happen |  a thunderstorm has broken answered the doctor we shall have the wind down upon us before long and then we shall see what we shall see | scarcely had he spoken when i was thrown flat on my face by a tremendous gust which in an instant tore away from the posts the sail which formed our tent and sent it fluttering in the air | the trees bent before the furious blast while whole branches which were torn off went flying to a distance and we felt masses of sticks and leaves come rattling down on our heads | for some moments we were in total darkness then a flash of lightning of extreme vividness burst from the clouds showing to me the rest of the party lying down as i was and involuntarily attempting to shield their heads with their hands while all around the lofty palm trees were yielding to the gale which was tearing their feathery heads into fragments | every instant i expected some of the trees to come down and crush us | we were utterly helpless for had we attempted to push off in the champan we might have been driven against the points of the sunken trees to the destruction of the boat or have been stranded on the beach | the champan it was to be hoped was securely moored | i shouted to the crew who had remained on board but the uproar made by the howling of the wind and the crashing boughs and the dashing of the water against the banks completely drowned my voice | all we could do therefore was to remain where we were | a jaguar might have picked us off without difficulty but i trusted that they were as unable to move as we were or what was probable were terrified by the fierceness of the tempest which has the effect of overcoming the most savage natures | i groped about till i got hold of my rifle which as usual i had placed by my side when i went to sleep | at length there came a lull when i heard the doctor's voice shouting out barry my boy where are you | mr concannan tim tim speak and tell me if you are alive |  shure it's alive i am answered tim though almost kilt by a big bough which came down just now on my back | i saw him by another flash of lightning which just then darted from the sky creeping out from beneath a huge branch which had happily formed an arch over him | i was thankful too to hear my uncle's voice |  stay where you are tim cried the doctor and we'll join you | providence has formed a hut for us and into that hut we will creep as we shall be safer there than elsewhere | we followed his advice and were joined by jumbo who followed his master under the shelter and the huge bough effectually guarded us from the numerous other branches which came hurtling through the air | as we could now hear each other's voices my uncle expressed his fears about the champan | i told him that i had seen her safe during one of the flashes of lightning and that i hoped she was still secured to the bank | hour after hour it seemed went by the wind howling the thunder roaring the lightning flashing through the air darting amid the trees and running in fiery lines along the ground with a brightness which so dazzled my eyes that for the next moment i felt as if struck by blindness leaving the forest dark as erebus though i could still see the trees waving backwards and forwards against the sky | how thankful i felt when at length the thunder rolled away the lightning ceased and the wind almost immediately afterwards fell till it became perfectly calm | in a short time the fire flies darted out from their hiding places and filled the air with their soft light but we were not inclined to contemplate their beauty just then or to attend to anything else except endeavouring to make ourselves tolerably snug for the remainder of the night | we had escaped a great danger moreover of which we at first had not thought | our fire had gone out before the tempest broke on us or the flames might have set the grass and dry shrubs around on fire and though the forest itself was too green to burn it might have rendered the spot untenable | groping about we found the sail sticking in the bushes and dragging it over the bough which protected us we again secured it | in the meantime tim had been engaged in relighting the fire for which the storm had supplied us with an abundance of fuel | on hailing the champan we were answered by the padrone who to our satisfaction informed us that she had escaped injury though some of the crew had received pretty severe blows from falling branches | as we could not trust to the crew tim undertook to keep watch while my uncle the doctor and i slept | the storm had done us one great service too it had blown away the mosquitoes and other biting insects besides having materially cooled the air | the next morning we continued our voyage the greater portion of which was performed by the men shoving on the champan with their long poles sometimes among trunks of trees at others amid rocks but occasionally they had to go on shore and tow the boat along through the whirlpools and rapids which we met with | the scenery was often very beautiful consisting of magnificent ranges of mountains their bases rising abruptly out of the river covered with umbrageous trees and flowering shrubs of various hues | at length we reached the neighbourhood of honda where our voyage terminated and from thence we were to travel over the mountains for upwards of two hundred miles | we here parted with our friend the doctor who was bound for santa fe de bogota where he told us he hoped to get employment | he wished us good bye with real heartiness and i believe was grateful to my uncle for having brought him thus far on his journey | i was much obliged to him for the interesting information he had given me and i told him that should he ever come our way i was sure that my father would be happy to see him at our house |  perhaps i may come my young friend he answered it is possible that the inhabitants of bogota may not appreciate my talents | mounted on a stout mule and carrying the whole of his property in his saddle bags he took his way eastward over the mountains towards the capital of new granada while we followed a more southerly course across a wild and mountainous region | chapter three | journey over the mountains lose our way we find padre pacheco enjoying a bath invited to his house fresh guests arrive a patriot general a lovely heroine a supper at the padre's i am invited to join the patriot cause anecdotes of generals bolivar and paez general bermudez the guests depart candela comes as our guide the general's history attacked by indians we wound and capture their chief carry him with us our journey continued | our journey was performed on mule back but i had expected to be provided with a good horse to ride |  you would soon have wished yourself mounted on your present steady sure footed animal observed my uncle the roads we shall have to traverse are such as no horse could pass over in safety with a rider on its back | i soon found that he was right | the country we travelled over was wild and rugged in the extreme | dark rocks of varied forms rose in lofty perpendicular walls on one hand while torrents dashed down the mountain sides on the other | frequently we had to ascend by a succession of rough steps cut in the rock and then to descend by a similar description of path with a precipice on each side of it down which had a mule made a false step its rider would have been thrown many hundred feet into the abyss below | i soon got accustomed to the sagacious animal i rode and taking my uncle's advice i left the bridle loose on its neck allowing it to pick its own way which it did in a sensible manner following most patiently the windings of the paths | our mules had been well trained to ascend and descend these precipitous mountains and as they proceeded they fixed their small feet with caution and firmness in the holes made in the ground by the constant passing and repassing of other travellers | for some distance we proceeded almost parallel with the river magdalena of which through openings in the rocks we got fine views as it rushed onwards foaming and eddying amid the huge boulders in its course | then leaving it on the right we continued along the bed of a small stream for a league or so till we reached a shallow lake which runs in and out amid the precipitous cliffs rising to an immense height above it while over its whole extent were scattered huge masses of rock which had been hurled down by the convulsions of nature from the summit of the mountains | not a canoe floated on its bosom no human being bird or animal was visible | it was one of the wildest and most desolate scenes i had ever beheld and contrasted strongly with the fertile region through which we had passed teeming with human and animal life | i was very glad then when crossing another rugged height we reached a small valley | but i must not stop to describe the various incidents of our journey or attempt to portray the scenery of the country we traversed | it varied greatly sometimes being grand and beautiful at others monotonous | sometimes we slept at the cottages of the natives at others we bivouacked in the woods or under the shelter of lofty rocks | we each carried a net hammock at the cruppers of our mules so that we had it ready to hang up between a couple of trees or in a hut whenever we stopped either for our noonday rest or at night | on crossing a wide elevated plain we passed through several forests of date trees and had a few arabs with their camels been moving about among them the whole scene would have borne a truly african appearance | the journey appeared a very long one though we pushed on each day as fast as our mules could travel but we had to make frequent detours to avoid places held by the spaniards who though often defeated still had considerable forces in the field | my uncle and i having been born in the country would have been looked upon as spanish subjects and as all the members of our family were known to hold liberal opinions we might be detained and compelled to serve in the spanish ranks | at all events my uncle thought it prudent to keep out of the way of the royalists as well as of those indians who were known to side with them | whenever we passed through a village or came to a halt for the night we endeavoured to gain information of the movements of the troops and in the course of three days we came in sight of as many spots where villages had once stood which now only presented blackened walls and devastated fields the sad result of civil war | when able we obtained a guide to conduct us over the mountain paths but we were not always successful and sometimes had to make our way alone | we were now approaching our home but my uncle had been so long absent from the country that he was unacquainted with the road and even tim had to confess that he did not sufficiently recollect the appearance of the scenery to guide us | we had descended to a lower level and after passing through a thick tropical forest were proceeding along the margin of a river looking for an open spot to encamp when the sun disappeared behind the mountains on our right | there is little or no twilight it will be remembered in that latitude and before we were aware of it darkness came down upon us |  shure we can camp aisy enough observed tim but about the provender i'm afraid our canteen is well nigh empty | such proved to be the case and we had every prospect of going without our supper | we had two mulatto boys to look after our mules but they were of little use for any other purpose and though we heard some parrots and other birds uttering various notes in the trees it was too dark to see them | still as it could not be helped we were about to make our usual preparations for spending the night when tim exclaimed that he saw a light some distance ahead and as it probably proceeded from a hut or perhaps from a habitation of more importance he proposed that we should ride forward towards it | my uncle with his usual wariness was unwilling to allow this fearing that it might proceed from the camp of a party of spaniards or indians | i offered therefore to make my way to it and ascertain whether we were likely to meet with a friendly reception | to this he consented provided i took care not to be discovered | carrying my rifle in one hand and a stick with which to feel my way in the other i directed my steps towards the light | as i approached it i crept forward slowly concealing myself behind the shrubs which grew thickly around | as i advanced i saw that there were several lights and i heard voices with now and then the sound of laughter |  if they are enemies they are jolly ones i said to myself there is nothing very dreadful here i suspect | creeping on a few paces and looking over the bushes i saw in an open spot surrounded by trees at a short distance from the river's brink four indians clothed in jackets and trousers each holding a torch in his hand and in their centre the head and shoulders of a jovial friar for that he was a friar i knew by his shorn crown just rising above a huge cask sunk in the ground | the friar was evidently enjoying a bath though he was taking it in a somewhat curious fashion as i at once guessed to avoid any risk of being carried off by an alligator | now he sank himself up to his chin in the refreshing fluid now up he popped again like a jack in the box now down he went and then up he came again holding on by the edge of the cask his indian attendants meanwhile watching him as grave as judges | at first i doubted whether i ought to intrude on the bather but as he showed no inclination to get out i thought that i might venture to pay my respects to him and at the same time ask him to afford us shelter in his house which i knew could not be far off | i accordingly advanced and taking off my hat saluted him with a polite bow | the indians who were crouching down in front of him looking out towards the river apparently to watch that no hungry alligator or jaguar should pounce out upon their master upon this sprang to their feet and looked very much inclined to run away |  who are you and whence do you come | inquired the padre |  i am travelling with my uncle senor denis concannan and a servant towards our home not far from hence and having no guide we have lost our way i replied |  my father is senor barry desmond perhaps he is known to your reverence |  of course he is and a dear friend answered the padre |  and you are his son | if i were not dripping wet i would give you an embrace: receive it in imagination | you and your uncle and attendants if there were fifty of them are welcome to my abode | go and bring them hither and as soon as my servant comes down with my dry clothes i will accompany you | i must own by the by that i felt well pleased to accept the padre's embrace in imagination rather than in reality and heartily thanking him for his kind reception i begged to know his name that i might tell my uncle |  the padre pedro pacheco he replied he will remember me though he has been absent so many years and will require no further assurance that he will meet with all the hospitality that i can afford him | now go young caballero and bring him here and by the time he arrives i shall be in a fit condition to set out | on this making another bow i set off to return by the way i had come | i had not gone far when i met tim who ever careful about my safety had followed me | hurrah  shure it's all right if it's the padre pacheco he exclaimed |  i know his riverence well and there isn't a praste like him in all the country round though to tell you the truth misther barry he isn't much in favour with the spaniards or monks up in the towns for he's a mighty great liberal and is as ready to fight as to pray for the cause of the republicans | tim gave me this information as we were making our way back to where we had left my uncle and the mules | we were not long in saddling the animals and replacing their packs and by the time we got back to the padre's bathing place we found him standing ready to receive us clothed in dry garments | he greeted my uncle as cordially as he had done me and taking our arms two of the indians with torches leading the way we proceeded by a path through the forest to his house which stood on a slight elevation above the river | it was a thatched one storied building with a walled in courtyard on one side and surrounded by a garden of considerable extent as far as i could judge by the torchlight | he at once ushered us into a good sized room furnished with a large table and benches and a ponderous arm chair at one end | the table was covered with various substantial viands as well as delicacies and fruits of all sorts showing that the padre was given to hospitality and that he was at all times prepared for the unexpected arrival of guests |  i sent up to order supper to be got ready for you and i see that my people have not been dilatory he observed as we entered the room |  perhaps we shall have other guests and i only hope they may be such as we desire to see | sometimes the spaniards come this way and i am compelled though much against the grain to be civil to them | however before you sit down you may desire to wash the dust off your hands and faces and if you will accompany me i will show you where you can do so here candela bring a torch and towels for the caballeros | as he spoke an intelligent looking black servant led the way into the courtyard where we saw a fountain falling into a stone basin the water afterwards serving to irrigate the garden | we quickly performed our ablutions especially refreshing after the heat of the day and then returned with the padre into the supper room | we were on the point of sitting down when the sound of horses' hoofs coming along the path from the southward reached our ears |  grant heaven that they are friends | said the padre looking grave |  should they be royalists you will guide your conversation accordingly senor concannan he observed here candela go out and welcome the cavaliers whoever they may be | the black relighting his torch hurried out and soon we heard his voice calling to the other servants to hold the cavaliers' horses and in a loud voice welcoming the travellers | one of them spoke a few words in return whereupon the padre started up and rushed out to the front of the house | i followed him and saw him clasping the hand of a tall cavalier who had just dismounted from a powerful horse which one of the servants was holding | on another steed of more delicate proportions sat a lady who as the light of the torch fell on her countenance appeared to be young and unusually beautiful | at the same moment several other persons came up and the tall cavalier having now assisted the lady to dismount advanced towards the house the rest of the party throwing themselves from their horses following | on entering the cavalier cast a suspicious glance at my uncle and me |  who are these | he asked of padre pacheco in a low voice |  they are english friends to the cause you can trust them answered the padre and he mentioned our names | on this the new comer advanced towards my uncle and taking his hand shook it warmly afterwards doing me the same favour |  the english are always my friends he said a noble nation who love liberty and especially are you so gentlemen who belong to such an esteemed family | would that we had many more like them | but our cause will triumph everywhere the tyrant gothos are yielding to our arms whenever we can catch them in the open country and as hornets are burned out of their nests we must expel them from the cities in which they have taken refuge and then not sheathe the sword till we have cut them to pieces or driven them before us into the ocean say i not well donna paola | he added turning to the young lady | a rich colour mounted to her brow as with kindling eye she replied heaven will favour the righteous cause and aid you general bermudez and your brave followers in the glorious undertaking | she spoke in a firm yet sweet and melodious voice and i at once saw that she was an enthusiast in the cause | my uncle regarded her with a look of surprise and admiration and bowing said i have often heard of you donna paola salabriata and rejoice to have the opportunity of meeting you | donna paola smiled and bowed gracefully and the padre who had been giving directions to his servants then appearing requested her to take possession of the only private room in his house which he could offer though he added it is unworthy of one to whom is due all the honour we can pay | the young lady smiled |  i am accustomed to rough lodging she answered and will gratefully accept your kindness senor padre | i judged from the appearance and manners of the other persons who entered that they were officers on the staff of general bermudez | two however appeared to be of rank and one i soon discovered to be an irishman from the rich brogue in which he addressed me on hearing my name | he had been long in the service but had not forgotten his native tongue he assured me an assertion not in the slightest degree necessary | he at once launched forth in praise of general bermudez whom he asserted to be next to bolivar the best and bravest man and truest patriot in the country and from what i afterwards heard of the general i am convinced that he was right | after a short time the whole party collected in the supper room but did not take the seats which the padre requested them to occupy | their eyes i saw were frequently turned towards the door | at length it opened and donna paola entered the room with that grace which spanish women so generally possess | she looked even more beautiful than at first her raven hair secured by a circlet of gold contrasting with the delicate colour of her complexion which was fairer than that of spanish women generally | her figure was slight and she appeared scarcely so tall as i had supposed when i had first seen her in her riding habit | she was followed by a black damsel her constant attendant i found who stood behind the chair she occupied on the right of the general | he desired my uncle and me to take the seats on the other side | i confess that interested though i had been i had become very hungry and was glad to fall to on the viands which the good padre had provided | there were a variety of dishes: fish and fowl predominating an olla podrida omelets and puddings | there was flesh too some small animals which i strongly suspected were monkeys | the party were evidently too much interested in talking of affairs of importance to pay much attention to the nature of the provisions set before them | the young and handsome officer a colonel i judged by his uniform sat next to donna paola and from the tender way in which he addressed her and the looks she gave him in return i suspected that her patriotic enthusiasm had not steeled her heart against all softer influences | such i afterwards found to be the case | she had promised to marry the colonel as soon as the patriots had triumphed and the liberties they had been struggling for had been established | it was important to gain exact information as to the intended movements of the royalists and donna paola i found had undertaken the hazardous duty of visiting bogota and other cities and from thence transmitting intelligence to the patriot leaders | the young colonel looked grave when the subject was mentioned and from what he said would willingly have dissuaded her from the attempt |  if we fear to run a risk for the purpose of obtaining an important end that end may never be gained she answered and the time you look for enrico must be postponed she added playfully tapping him with her fan on the arm for heroine as she was she carried one | what woman indeed with spanish blood in her veins would be without so useful an implement | the party were to continue for some days together and then to separate in various directions general bermudez to return to the plains and take command of his guerilla forces which had already proved so terrible a scourge to the spaniards | had they known how close he was to them with only a small band of followers they would eagerly have despatched a force to effect his capture | the conversation at the supper table was animated in the extreme padre pacheco taking an active part in it | after some time the general turned to me |  you have heard young gentleman of the glorious cause in which we are engaged he said |  many of the patriot leaders drew their swords when younger than you are | we want every one with honesty and courage to join us and we claim you as a compatriot | judging by your looks you will soon become expert in all the exercises required for a leader and i shall be glad to offer you a command in one of the brave bands serving under me when you have gained sufficient experience | i felt highly flattered at this address though i scarcely knew what to answer |  i shall be ready whenever called upon to do my duty towards the country of my birth i answered at length but i am under my father's orders to whom my first duty is due and i dare not pledge myself till i have consulted him |  well spoken young senor remarked the general |  knowing his sentiments i feel assured that he will not deny your request and that i may count upon you ere long as a follower |  surely the young englishman will feel it the highest privilege he can possess to fight in so glorious a cause observed donna paola looking across the table at me with her beautiful eyes |  say at once my dear young friend that with your father's permission you will devote yourself to the liberation of your native land | for what nobler task can a human being live or die if needs be | for my part i am ready to sacrifice all i hold dear in life and life itself so that i may but afford the feeble aid a woman can give in forwarding the great object | i had found some difficulty in answering the general i found it still more trying to reply to the beautiful donna paola | i remembered too well the advice given me by my sensible schoolmaster yet as i listened to the enthusiastic conversation of those into whose company i was so unexpectedly thrown and heard of the atrocities of the spaniards and the gallant exploits of the patriot leaders i was naturally carried away and soon forgot all my prudent resolutions in spite of the remarks made by my uncle to prevent me from committing myself |  whenever summoned you will find me ready general i exclaimed and i call my friends here to witness my promise |  well spoken my young patriot cried the general stretching across the table to take my hand while donna paola smiled her approval |  remember barry that your promise is but conditional whispered my uncle your father may have other work for you | during the time we sat at table i heard anecdotes of most of the chief leaders of the patriot as also of the royalist forces | of the former the two principal men were don simon bolivar a man of good birth and education and jose paez who belonging to the humblest rank of life had been brought up among the hardy llaneros of the apure | bolivar was born in the city of caraccas in the neighbourhood of which his father don juan vicente bolivar had large possessions and was of noble rank | at an early age he was sent to madrid for his education on completing which he made the tour of europe visiting england among other countries | when only nineteen he married a beautiful girl the daughter of a nobleman and for a short time lived in the enjoyment of domestic life until he was deprived of his wife by death | to alleviate his grief he again visited europe and the united states where he imbibed those liberal principles which induced him to take a prominent part in fighting for the freedom of his native country | in 1811 when general miranda the commander of the patriot army cut down and destroyed the spanish standard and hoisted the tricolour in its stead simon bolivar joined him and was immediately appointed to a command in the independent army | after a long and desperate struggle venezuela again fell into the hands of the royalists who retaliated on those who had opposed them and the whole country was reduced to a frightful state of misery | the spanish troops treated the people with the most revolting ferocity plundering and murdering in all directions on the most trifling pretexts | old men women and children even were arrested and often cruelly maimed and massacred as rebels | these barbarous proceedings aroused the indignation of bolivar who had escaped from the country and uniting with a relative ribas he proceeded from the island of curacoa to venezuela where he speedily raised a small force | attacking the spanish garrison of the town of teneriffe on the river magdalena he drove them out proceeding southward to bogota then in the hands of the patriots | the spanish generals at this time were boves rosette and morales | they were joined by morillo who was sent in 1815 with a powerful army from spain | bolivar had again to fly but once more returning in 1817 he defeated morillo in several battles and in 1819 he had become president of the venezuelan republic the congress of which had been installed at angostura on the orinoco | from his finished education his knowledge of the world and his military talents he was well fitted as he showed for the important position he held | very different was the career of general paez who was born at araure | when but seventeen years old the priest of that place who was his uncle sent him with a considerable sum of money to be delivered to another padre residing at a distance | that he might perform the journey in safety he was provided with a mule an old pistol and a rusty sword | it was fortunate that he was thus armed for on the road he was attacked by three men who demanded his treasure | young paez instead of giving it up threw himself from his mule with his pistol cocked and his weapon for a wonder going off killed one of his opponents and at the same time bursting struck another in the face then drawing his sword which providentially also came out of its sheath the youthful hero charged the third robber who with his wounded companion then took to flight | not knowing what might be the consequence of having killed a man young jose after delivering the money to the padre afraid of returning home fled to the province of barenas where he obtained employment on a large cattle farm | the overseer was a black man who conceiving a dislike for the youth compelled him to perform all sorts of laborious duties and among others to break in the most vicious horses | he thus became a first rate horseman and learned also the use of the lance the weapon of the llaneros | the brutal black in order to exhibit his dislike to young paez compelled him more than once on returning home after a hard day's labour to bring a pail of water and wash his muddy feet an act which paez did not forget | on the breaking out of the revolutionary war he enlisted as a common soldier in the militia of barenas but soon proving his superiority over his companions he was able to raise and organise an independent body of cavalry with which ere long he rendered important service to the cause | his troops ever had the utmost confidence in him when charging he was sure to be the first among the ranks of the enemy his lance making terrible havoc | ever hating the spaniards with a deadly hatred on account of their cruelties he never spared them | unfortunately he was at length taken prisoner and an order was issued by the spanish general for his execution | it was the custom of the spaniards to lead their prisoners out at night to some lonely spot where they were quietly despatched with a lance or sword | paez and some of his fellow prisoners were being led out for this purpose when believing that he was merely to be taken before the general he borrowed a hat of one of his companions | the officer in charge of the party not recognising him ordered him back to be exchanged for the unfortunate owner who was supposed to be the notorious rebel captain | he thus unexpectedly obtained a respite of a day | the next night he was aroused by a loud noise in the streets and fully expected that he was about to be led out to execution instead of which it proved that the spaniards had been alarmed by the report that a large body of patriots were about to attack the town and were hurriedly preparing to evacuate it | paez took the opportunity of freeing himself from his fetters and having helped to release some of his fellow prisoners they overpowered the sentinels and made their escape | he was quickly at the head of a fresh body of insurgents and after going through numerous adventures he found himself holding the independent command of a large body of llaneros | on frequent occasions though with inferior numbers he attacked and defeated the royalists | the spaniards having regained their power in other parts of the country compelled by the fearful cruelties they practised vast numbers of men women and children to fly into the wilderness and take refuge in the camp of paez | among them were many persons of distinction and a regular system of government being established paez was chosen supreme chief with the rank of general of brigade | to supply his starving followers he at the head of his troops during the rainy season made a long march across the flooded savannahs to attack the city of barenas which abounded with all the commodities of which he stood most in need | when approaching barenas he sent a detachment to attack the small town of pedroza for the purpose of drawing the spanish forces away from the city to its relief | his ruse was successful and galloping forward he and his ragged followers were quickly in possession of the city | each man loading himself with as large an amount of provisions and stores as he could carry the troops quickly again retreated and succeeded in conveying their booty to their starving friends | on the arrival in the country of a large army under general morillo paez gave him battle on the plains of apure and by a stratagem pretending to fly induced the spanish cavalry to follow | his active horsemen then wheeling round attacked them so furiously with their lances that nearly the whole were destroyed | i heard many anecdotes related of him | on one occasion he overtook in a skirmish a spanish major of cavalry who defended himself bravely but when paez was in the act of running his lance through him he exclaimed o general | had you not been better mounted than i am i should have overmatched you |  if you think so exclaimed the gallant paez we will exchange horses and renew the fight | to this the major agreed but no sooner did he find himself on the back of the general's horse than he galloped off at full speed followed by paez who finding that he was losing ground threw his lasso over the major's neck and brought him to the ground | as the major however had defended himself bravely paez gave him quarter a favour neither he nor his llaneros were in the habit of granting to their foes | on another occasion one of his men brought in as prisoner a spanish hussar of the regiment of fernando the seventh who in order to appear more terrific wore long beards |  why did you grant him quarter | inquired paez |  because answered the llanero my conscience forbade me to despatch a capuchin friar |  he is no friar but a regular soldier | bring me no more capuchin friars said the general | on this occasion too he spared the prisoner's life and the man entering his service became much attached to him | paez ever proved himself a most indefatigable enemy to the spaniards | for weeks and months he followed the steps of morillo unceasingly clinging to him and on every opportunity dashing into his camp at night frequently with not more than a hundred and fifty or two hundred men slaughtering all he encountered and never failing to cut his way back with trifling loss | he would also when the royalists were fatigued by a harassing day's march drive off all their cattle and baggage mules leaving them frequently without provisions | the most renowned of his exploits occurred when he had formed a junction with bolivar on the plains of apure | their troops were in an almost starving condition and unless they could cross the river they would have to make a circuitous march of many leagues to obtain provisions while on the opposite bank were seen vast numbers of cattle which could not be reached for want of boats | about midway across the stream there was also a fleet of sixty flecheras or gun boats well armed and manned belonging to the enemy | bolivar stood on the shore gazing disconsolately at the enemy's fleet when paez rode up to him and inquired the cause of his disquietude |  i would give the world to have possession of the spanish flotilla for without it i can never cross the river answered bolivar |  it shall be yours in an hour replied paez |  it is impossible said bolivar |  leave that to me rejoined paez and galloped off | in a few minutes he returned at the head of a body of three hundred lancers selected for their proved bravery and strength from his llaneros and leading them to the bank he thus addressed them we must have those flecheras or die | let those who please follow tio or uncle for so his favourite troopers were accustomed to call him | saying this he dashed into the river and swam towards the flotilla | his guard followed him with their lances in their mouths now encouraging their horses to bear up against the current now swimming by their sides and patting their necks and shouting to scare away the alligators of which there were hundreds in the river | thus they proceeded till they reached the flotilla then mounting their horses headed by their leader they sprang from their backs on board the boats | a desperate struggle ensued but the llaneros were victorious and driving the unfortunate crews overboard they carried the flecheras to the bank of the river where the patriot forces were drawn up | equal to him in most respects and superior in some was the noble looking cavalier general bermudez in whose company i now so unexpectedly found myself | i could learn less about him at the time but i afterwards heard much of his interesting history | notwithstanding the difficulties and dangers with which they were surrounded the whole party seemed in high spirits and did not separate till a late hour | donna paola was the first to rise and bowing gracefully to the military officers and wishing them good night she left the room accompanied by her sable attendant | the table being then cleared our supper room was turned into a dormitory every corner of the house being likewise occupied | the padre requested my uncle and me to take possession of a small chamber near his own cell which afforded just space enough for us to stretch our legs | here with our saddles for pillows and horse cloths and cloaks for bedding we were quickly asleep | at an early hour the next morning we were astir and found an ample breakfast spread | general bermudez hurried over the meal and left the table and on going out to the front of the house soon afterwards i found him standing by his horse's head ready to mount | he presented a perfect picture of a commander of irregular troops | he was remarkably tall being considerably above six feet in height his figure well proportioned and evidently possessing great muscular power his handsome countenance showed intelligence and beamed with good nature and sincerity while the evening before i had been struck by his frank and genial manners so unlike those of the ordinary run of spaniards though he was as might be expected wanting in that polish which a constant intercourse with refined society seldom fails to give | though dexterous in the use of the lance as are all the warriors of the plain he was armed with a remarkably long gun which only a man of great strength could have used with any effect | a powder horn hung over his shoulders and a long dagger was secured by the folds of the ample scarf he wore round his waist | at a short distance off were the troopers who had formed his escort standing by their horses ready for the signal to mount | they were picked men mostly tall and stalwart and armed with lances and carbines evidently from their costume irregular cavalry and looking as if they could render as efficient service in that climate and region as any body of troops albeit clothed in more uniform fashion |  ah my young friend i am glad to have the opportunity of saying farewell he exclaimed putting out his hand you will not forget your promise of last night | and let me advise you to prepare yourself for the service you may render our beloved country | take every opportunity of perfecting yourself in horsemanship and practise the use of the lance and carbine i hope ere long to return this way and to enrol you among my troops when you will i doubt not with the practice we will be able to give you become thoroughly expert in the use of your weapons | should heaven preserve your life you must look forward to becoming a leader and consider well how you will have to act in all the circumstances in which you may be placed whether meeting the foes of our country on the plains or amid the mountains either pursuing or retreating before superior numbers endeavouring to effect a surprise or guarding against one | he proves the most successful leader who has reflected well during the quiet hours of the bivouac under the starry vault of heaven or in his silent chamber how he will conduct himself in the varied chances of warfare | brute courage is useful in the heady fight but the possessor of that only can never be a fitting leader | i was thanking the general for his advice when donna paola appeared led forth by colonel acosta the young officer i have before mentioned who had been seated next to her at supper | he pressed her hand as he assisted her to mount and by the look she gave him i saw that their affection was mutual | i trusted for both their sakes that she would be protected in the dangerous undertaking in which she was engaged | the general springing into his saddle the rest of the party followed his example | waving his adieux he led the way along the side of the mountain while padre pacheco stretching out his hands blessed him and his followers and commended them to the care of heaven | my uncle and tim had also come out prepared for a start | the hospitable padre urged us to remain longer but we were naturally anxious to reach home | on my uncle making inquiries as to the best road to take i will send candela with you said the padre he knows it well and may be of use to you should any roving bands of indians and i have noticed that there are several out seeing a small party attack you | they mostly know and respect me for though they are but poor christians they look upon me as possessing supernatural powers and when candela explains that you are friends of mine they will allow you to pass without molestation | without hesitation my uncle gladly accepted the kind padre's offer and candela was forthwith ordered to get ready | he did not require many minutes his preparations consisting in bolting a mess of porridge to enable him the better to undergo the fatigue of the journey | he was to proceed on foot with the natives who conducted our baggage mules |  you must come soon and see me again said the padre as he wished me good bye |  you are sure to find me for i never move far from home seeing i have my little flock to look after and matters of importance to attend to | but before you go let me caution you senor denis not to speak to any one about those persons you saw here | it might lead to unpleasant consequences should the tyrannical spaniards hear that my quiet abode is frequented by patriots and we never know what evil birds may carry information |  you may trust barry and me and my brother's servant though we are not likely to meet any but friends to the cause where we are going replied my uncle | the padre looked satisfied and again wishing him good bye we mounted and rode forward led by candela who with a long stick in his hand kept well ahead of us | we soon lost sight of the padre's abode | the road we took was wild and rugged across the spurs of the mountains sometimes we had to cross rocky heights again to descend into narrow valleys with streams through which we waded not without difficulty running down them | occasionally we had to pass amid thickly growing trees which concealed from view the mountain tops which might otherwise have assisted to guide us and we agreed that it was fortunate candela had come with us to show us the way | we had to encamp another night in the forest as it would have been dangerous to proceed over that kind of country in the dark but candela assured us that we might reach my father's house early the following day | we pushed forward till the gloom of evening came on when we looked about for a convenient spot for encamping | we selected one on some rocky ground just outside a wood with a deep ravine in front of us while on our left was a precipice of a hundred feet or so in height at the bottom of which flowed a rapid stream | securing the legs of our mules with their halters in the usual fashion so that they could not stray we turned them loose while we lighted our fire and placed our saddles and horse cloths ready for sleeping | a basket of provisions which the padre had secured to one of the baggage mules afforded us an ample supper so that we had only to boil our chocolate and to heat some water with which to mix the aguadiente the padre had sent prescribing a cupful as a preventive against the ill effects of the damp night air or any noxious exhalations rising from the valleys though there was not much chance of our suffering from these in the lofty position we occupied | while we were seated at supper i asked my uncle what he knew of the guerilla chief whose acquaintance we had just made |  i learned something of his history from padre pacheco this morning he answered and his career has been very similar to that of general paez | he is the son of humble parents who resided near caraccas their occupation being to convey provisions to the garrison and inhabitants in which work he assisted them | illiterate as was the old bermudez he was a devoted patriot and notwithstanding the danger he ran in doing so endeavoured to induce all the young men of his acquaintance to join the troops then being secretly levied for the independent cause by general miranda | having incautiously uttered some liberal expressions he was seized by the governor of the city monteverde | in vain young bermudez pleaded that mercy might be shown his aged parent notwithstanding his advanced age he was cruelly gibbeted his son being barbarously compelled to witness his execution | this was the fate of many others who dared to utter a word against spanish tyranny |  young bermudez managed to effect his escape and carrying with him his unhappy mother he set off over the plains of maturin where he intended to provide a shelter for her few remaining years while he entered the service of his country to revenge the murder of his father | her death from grief on the way set him free and he immediately joined as a private a body of the irregular cavalry of the plains commanded by the brave hirogas | the band from its inferiority of numbers seldom came to an open engagement but harassed the foraging parties of the spaniards never failing to come off victorious | bermudez by his determined bravery and great personal prowess in these skirmishes gained the admiration of his comrades and was speedily raised to the rank of lieutenant of a small troop at whose head he performed numberless acts of valour | from his great strength and skill in all the games in which the horsemen of the plains take delight he still further rose in the estimation of his companions while from his unassuming manners and excellent conduct he was beloved by all who served with him |  the band to which bermudez belonged in a short time amounted to four hundred men and so much injury did they inflict on the spaniards that monteverde resolved if possible to crush them | he accordingly sent out a strong detachment six hundred cavalry and an equal number of infantry in pursuit of hirogas | the forces of the guerilla chief were strongly posted on the top of a hill about fifteen leagues from the spanish headquarters | they were not men to be taken by surprise and as they saw the spaniards advancing they charged furiously down upon them | the odds were fearfully against the patriots and the brave hirogas carried by his impetuosity too far in advance fell into the hands of the enemy desperately wounded | bermudez on seeing this charged with his troop upon the spanish infantry and not only succeeded in rescuing his chief but put the enemy to flight | the spaniards left about one third of their number dead on the field and many of their horses and arms in the hands of the victorious guerillas |  hirogas dying of his wounds bermudez was unanimously chosen chief of the band and his fame spreading volunteers flocked to his standard | he had no difficulty in mounting them from the many herds of horses which roamed at large on the mountains and plains of venezuela which were easily caught with the lasso and quickly broken in at the experienced hands of his followers |  having organised his band he attacked the spanish forces laying siege to the town of maturin and in three successive encounters supplying himself with arms ammunition and every military essential | his force was then regularly enrolled by the congress as a portion of its troops and in appearance and discipline became far superior to the generality of the guerillas |  being now recognised as one of the leading patriot chiefs he united himself to general roxas and in conjunction they attacked the army under the spanish general boves | in this action roxas slew boves and nine others with his own hand and bermudez was said to have killed thirty men in the action during which he broke three lances | the patriot government in recognition of his services now created him a general of division and offered him pay but he nobly declined any remuneration observing that his object was to fight for his country's liberty without the intention of receiving reward | by his frequent forays into the plains where he collected large herds of cattle he contributed greatly to the support of the patriot army | such was the man under whom should my father give me permission i had undertaken to serve | i felt flattered that he should have thought me capable of being of any use among his hardy and experienced horsemen and i could scarcely account for the reason of his so distinguishing me | i asked my uncle what he thought about the matter |  he saw that you were a likely lad and took it for granted that your father's son was brave and intelligent | he admires the english and wishes to have a few with him to assist in civilising and disciplining his followers he answered | we talked on for some time till my uncle proposed that we should lie down and go to sleep leaving tim and candela to keep watch alternately and maintain the fire as even at that elevation we were liable to be attacked by a prowling jaguar or puma | i never slept more soundly in my life and when i was awakened by tim pulling at my arm i found that the day had already broke |  hist masther barry he whispered |  the praste's black fellow candela says there are injyuns lurking about who maybe want to steal our mules or cut our throats if they have the chance and we've sent the boys to bring in the animals and misther denis and candela have gone forward to get a look down the gorge where we think they have hidden intending to take us by surprise | i should have said that on the other side of the gorge was a ridge beyond which the ground again sloped thus enabling a party to approach within gun shot of where we were encamped | on jumping to my feet i saw my uncle and candela creeping along towards a fallen trunk which lay close above the brink of a precipice | at that instant an indian sprang up bow in hand from the other side of the trunk and shot an arrow which quivered in the ground close by my uncle's side | he rushed forward on seeing this and before the indian could fix another arrow had felled him to the earth with his sword | the next moment a large party of indians appeared on the top of the ridge and a shower of arrows fell close to us: happily none took effect and i saw my uncle drop so as to conceal himself behind a log while he levelled his rifle over it at the indians | as he saw the indians about to shoot tim pulled me behind the nearest tree and probably saved me and himself from being wounded by the arrows which as it was whistled close to our ears | before the indians could move forward my uncle fired and a tall warrior who seemed to be their chief fell wounded to the ground | this evidently disconcerted them |  now is our time cried my uncle |  barry tim call the mule boys and follow me and leaping over the log he dashed down the ravine sword in hand and rapidly climbed the opposite side | we obeyed his orders and the indians seized with a sudden panic on seeing us coming and probably believing others were to follow took to their heels leaving their chief bleeding on the ground | we fired as did my uncle who had reloaded his gun to expedite their movements and two more fell dead the rest continuing their flight |  though he is an enemy we must not let this fellow bleed to death said my uncle stooping down |  come barry we'll bind up his wound and carry him along with us perhaps he may be able to give us some important information and at all events we shall learn why he attacked us | my uncle soon stopped the flow of blood from the indian's side and the muleteers having brought the animals round by crossing the valley a little way above where we stood we placed our captive on one of them | we then guided by candela hurried forward on our journey keeping a sharp look out lest the fugitive indians should return | chapter four | approach my home a welcome my sister norah the indian's wound dressed he takes his medicine from norah his gratitude my family a happy evening candela leaves us our relative don fernando serrano gerald and i pay him a visit the barawa indians our cousins donna isabella monterola i practise with the lance win donna isabella's approval we take our departure swim across a river put to flight by a boa constrictor travel along the borders of a lake see dr stutterheim he accompanies us home takes kanimapo in hand the fate of donna paola salabriata start on a shooting expedition with the doctor encounter a huge anaconda i shoot it and save the doctor carry off the skin in triumph | we were now approaching my father's house and i recognised several points in the surrounding scenery | the northern end of the lake came into view bordered by lofty palms and other graceful trees and i remembered well the shape of the mountains which rose above it | tim kept a watchful eye on our prisoner who though badly wounded might still he thought it probable attempt to make his escape | he had not spoken as yet but i observed his dark eye wandering on every side either in the hope of rescue or as if considering in what direction he should fly should he be able to free himself from the thongs by which he was secured to the mule | i was surprised that his followers should have deserted him in the cowardly way they had done | he was a fine looking savage with features more refined and regular than those of the indians i had hitherto seen | but his countenance was sullen and from his resolute aspect he probably expected that he would meet with the fate the spaniards invariably inflicted on their captives and be immediately put to death on our arrival at our destination | i suspect that he was in ignorance as to who we were and supposed that we belonged to a party of patriots and if so he must have been surprised on discovering the smallness of our numbers | tim led his mule constantly looking back to assure himself that he had not succeeded in loosening the thongs which secured his arms and legs | at the same time tim continued talking to me and pointing out various objects which i thought i remembered | at length he exclaimed sure masther barry there's the masther's house and mighty glad they'll all be to see you safe and he pointed to a good sized house with a broad verandah in front shaded by trees and standing in the midst of a large well irrigated garden | though smaller than i had supposed i at once knew the house to be that in which i was born |  and beyond it there higher up the hill you see mr concannan's mansion castle concannan we call it you'll remember and a pretty dacent castle it is with its high thick walls and courtyard it would take a pretty strong earthquake to shake it down | he has made it stronger still by blocking up some of the lower windows | in our eagerness to reach home we pushed on as rapidly as our mules could move | we were yet at a little distance when riding on ahead i caught sight of the figure of a black woman holding up a chubby little boy in her arms | i felt sure that he must be my youngest brother the baby as he was called whom i had never seen and that the woman must be our nurse josefa | she gazed at me doubting whether the tall young man she saw approaching could be the little boy who had gone away but a few years before | the baby who was a good bouncing one shook his rattle and seemed satisfied that i was some one he ought to expect | josefa knew me the moment i uttered her name and as i sprang from my mule she and little denis who was named after our uncle threw their arms round my neck | we then hastened on towards the front gate josefa shrieking out in her delight they are come | they are come | it is senor barry | her voice was heard at the house and my father and mother with my sister norah and the rest of the family guessing who we were hurried out to welcome us | our first greetings over my father expressed his satisfaction at my appearance |  you have benefited greatly by your stay in the old country barry he said and your journey here seems to have done you no harm | my mother pressed me to her heart and my sweet sister norah kissed my cheek again and again gazing at me as sisters are apt to do at a brother of whom they are proud | i am sure i felt proud of her and wondered that all the young men in the neighbourhood were not dying with love for her but perhaps they had too much to do in fighting for the liberty of their country | as may be supposed my father soon made inquiries about our captive | uncle denis explained how we had caught him and suggested that he should be placed in a strong room under a proper guard where his wound could be tended without the risk of his making his escape | my father observed that he had a small unoccupied room at the back of the house which would serve as a prison and to this our captive was at once conducted | as there was no surgeon either english or spanish living within many miles my uncle undertook to dress the indian's wound and to do his best to cure him | a bed was brought into the room on which he was placed | uncle denis then commenced his operations | after gently washing the wound he discovered to his satisfaction that the ball had passed through the indian's body and that he should therefore not have to attempt its extraction | this greatly facilitated his task | my mother having brought some linen bandages and a healing salve the wound was carefully bound up | the indian who did not once wince though he must have been suffering great pain gazed with a look of surprise at my uncle and the other bystanders and was evidently wondering why so much care was taken of him | my sister norah then brought in a cooling draught which she offered to him and speaking first in spanish and then in the language generally used by the indians in the neighbourhood advised him to take it assuring him that it would be beneficial | he without hesitation swallowed the draught and now speaking for the first time expressed his gratitude for the attention bestowed on him |  we are sorry that you were wounded and our wish is that you may recover said norah in a pitying tone |  you must rest now and if you will give your word that you will not attempt to escape or to injure those who are guarding you your arms will be left at liberty | the indian hesitated and was apparently considering the consequences which might ensue should he give the promise required |  tell him that we intend to keep him a prisoner only till his wound is healed and that we will not now trouble him with questions but we shall by and by wish to learn who he is and why he attacked your uncle and barry said my father | norah repeated this for having learned the indian tongue from her nurse she spoke it better than any one else in the house no one indeed would have been so likely to calm the suspicions of our captive and to gain his confidence as she was |  we do not wish you to speak now she added but to morrow or next day when you are stronger you will tell us what we seek to know | and now will you give me the promise we ask | it will be for your benefit and you know how you would have been treated had you fallen into the hands of the spaniards |  i promise to remain quiet as a child on its mother's breast answered the indian |  kanimapo never breaks his word and to you who have treated him so mercifully he will be faithful | on this assurance in which my father and uncle believed that they could trust the indian's limbs were left unfettered but at the same time they thought it prudent to place a man well armed with pistols and a dagger at the door and carefully to bar the window on the outside so that the captive even in possession of his full strength would have been unable to make his escape | my father with norah always accompanied by another person visited him several times during the evening | notwithstanding all the care bestowed on him he appeared to be suffering much though indianlike he endeavoured not to exhibit his feelings but his eye brightened whenever it fell on norah and he seemed to look upon her as his good genius | each time he showed his gratitude by a few words or by the expression of his countenance when unable to speak from pain | we had a very happy evening | my parents were glad to have me back safe and as may be supposed we had a great deal to talk about | my young brother gerald was fully as fine a little fellow as tim had described him | he constantly came up to my side and brought various articles to show me stuffed birds and the skins of animals he had shot and as soon as he could he dragged me away to exhibit his gun and his canoe and several animals he had tamed | kathleen my second sister was like norah but on a smaller scale and mary the third was a jolly little girl fat and chubby as a rosy apple in spite of the climate in which she was born while the baby denis was a merry chap who took to me at once though he might not exactly have comprehended our relationship | our uncle remained with us during the night that he might attend to our wounded prisoner though anxious to proceed to his brother's house | he was also unwilling to let candela go back alone lest the indians who attacked us might be still prowling about and should murder him |  i have no fear on that score senor he answered i know the country better than they do and can easily make my way without being discovered | they would not either willingly attack the senor padre's servant and so by daybreak to morrow i will depart as my master will be anxious to hear of your arrival | we sent many messages to the kind padre and my father especially invited him to come to our house should he at any time find himself threatened by the spaniards on account of his liberal principles | his cloth certainly would not save him as they had already shot several padres who had sided with the patriots the greater number of the priests however professed to be loyal subjects of the king of spain and supported his cause | one might have supposed that the spaniards after all they had suffered at the hands of napoleon's generals would have been inclined to treat their fellow countrymen in their colonies with leniency but on the contrary the only lesson they appeared to have learned had taught them to be more cruel and tyrannical than their conquerors | among the various friends about whom my uncle made inquiries was our relative don fernando serrano whose estate was a few leagues off though it abutted upon that of mr concannan which extended a considerable distance to the southward | properties in that country are of great extent and a visitor to don serrano's house had to travel a dozen leagues through his estate before reaching it | he was not only a wealthy man but greatly esteemed by all who knew him | he was supposed to entertain strong liberal principles but on account of his age and health had taken no part in the struggle going forward | my mother's and uncle denis's father i may remark had married his sister he was therefore my great uncle and his children were my cousins | our families too had always been on the most friendly terms and my father and mother had paid frequent visits at his house | his eldest son don carlos who was married and had a large family lived with him | two of don carlos' sons and one of his brothers had joined the insurgents but not to commit don fernando had assumed different names though we knew that both don fernando and don carlos afforded much pecuniary assistance to the liberals | from the precautions they had taken they believed that they were not suspected by the royalists and at all events they had escaped being molested | their chief cause of anxiety arose however from the hostile behaviour of a tribe of indians the barawas who inhabited the shores of the river guaviare falling into the orinoco | they belonged to the great carib family and had many years before been driven by their white invaders from their native territory on the coast to the eastward and had here settled themselves retaining however their warlike disposition and many of their ancient manners and customs | barawa is a carib name for the sea and they consequently took it as was supposed from their ancestors having lived on the borders of the ocean or having crossed it from the lands they once inhabited | we had little doubt that our prisoner belonged to that tribe and was probably a chief among them | my father told us of a report he had heard of spanish emissaries having visited them for the purpose of inducing them to take up arms against the republicans and should such be the case the capture of our prisoner kanimapo might prove a fortunate circumstance as we should hold him as a hostage for their good behaviour | the next morning however there appeared great probability that our hopes would be disappointed for on my uncle's visiting him he found him much worse | as the day advanced uncle denis expressed his fears that the indian would die notwithstanding all the care bestowed on him | day after day however the wounded man lingered on | my father and norah were assiduous in their attentions to him and he refused to take such medicines as we possessed from any other hands but my sister's | there was now no chance of his escaping for he was too weak to walk indeed he could scarcely sit up in his bed | still the indians possess wonderful vitality and endurance which enable them to recover from wounds of the body but they succumb very quickly to european diseases | though apparently growing weaker kanimapo still clung to existence | he seemed grateful too for the attentions shown him but except having mentioned his name he had not told us who he was nor had he given any reason for attacking our party | uncle denis had gone home and soon after gerald and i paid a visit at his house | we then went on to that of our relation don fernando serrano where we were received by him and my cousins with the greatest kindness | they were interested in hearing of all my adventures and especially in the accounts i gave them of our capturing the indian but they were unable to conjecture who he was | i was delighted with all the family they were so gentle and loving to each other and so kind to me | what also surprised me much was to find that don serrano regularly read the bible and had prayers with his family | such a thing was at that time probably unheard of in south america | they did not speak unkindly of the nearest padre who occasionally visited them but they evidently held him in no respect |  he is a poor ignorant man observed don carlos a blind leader of the blind he expressed his horror at finding we read the bible and urged us to give up the practice as one most dangerous to our souls | now it is very evident to me that from the bible alone do we know anything about god or how he desires men to live and therefore unless we read the bible we must remain ignorant of him and his will or obtain the knowledge second hand from one who might make grievous mistakes in interpreting it as padre bobo would most certainly do | i suspected from this what i afterwards found to be the case that my relatives were really protestants though they did not openly declare themselves to be so that their family had held these opinions from the time when many of the noblest in spain had espoused them | their ancestor had providentially escaped the doom which the horrible inquisition had inflicted on the greater number of those who had become protestants: having made his way to america with his wife he had settled in this then remote region but dreading persecution he had not attempted to promulgate his opinions beyond his own family | my maternal grandfather when he married donna teresina serrano had through her instruction become a protestant | thus in the heart of south america those principles were cherished which as was fondly hoped would spread around them when liberty should be established among the population | i suspect it was owing to the machinations of the priests that the barawa indians had proved so hostile to one whose wish and aim was always to benefit them | that such was the case don fernando could not clearly ascertain but it was known that padre bobo had made several visits to the indians for the purpose as he professed of converting them to christianity | he had managed indeed to induce some of them to allow him to baptise their children but they remained as utterly ignorant of the truth as before |  what i have here mentioned i heard from my own family before gerald and i set off to visit our friends | as is often the case in spanish families of wealth there were three generations living in harmony together and i was somewhat puzzled at first to distinguish between my numerous relatives | gerald who knew them all helped me but still i was frequently making mistakes | among them was a very beautiful girl whom i at first took to be one of my cousins and whom i addressed accordingly but after i had been there a couple of days she laughingly told me that though she should be very happy to be a relative she was not so in reality: that her name was isabella monterola and that she was a ward of don fernando | then suddenly changing her tone from gay to grave she said i am happy here and they are all very kind but i cannot forget my poor father who was murdered by the cruel spaniards because he loved liberty and hated tyranny and alas | my mother who was compelled to witness his execution died of grief | they would have shot her too had she lived as they did other women without remorse and me perhaps because i was their child had i not been so young but i was rescued from prison by juan serrano and brought here secretly | the spaniards did not know who carried me off and therefore could not send to bring me back or they would have done so | you have not been long enough in the country to have heard one tenth part of the horrible cruelties those gothos have inflicted on our people |  but you donna isabella are spanish and so are all our friends here i said after having expressed my horror of the atrocities which had been committed in the country |  i am a child of venezuela she answered proudly |  i disown the name of spaniard do not senor barry ever call me one again | we speak the language of spain it is true and boast our descent from noble ancestors who conquered the country in which we live but we have for ever severed our connection with the land from which we came because spaniards desire to enslave us | i had considered donna paola a heroine but as i listened to donna isabella i thought her a still more interesting one and she was equally anxious to enlist recruits in the cause of liberty | i had not forgotten the advice general bermudez had given me and i found my young cousins were in the habit of exercising themselves daily in the use of the lance as well as with firearms and swords | every morning they went out for some hours on horseback and practised on a level meadow at some little distance from the house and i soon became as expert as any of them | the ends of our lances were not only headless but covered with a soft pad so that we could charge at each other without much risk of serious injury and one day in a sham fight i unhorsed all my opponents in succession | as i rode up to where the ladies who had come out to witness our sports were standing they greeted me with loud applause and donna isabella especially showed her satisfaction by the bright smile she gave me and the eagerness with which she waved her scarf | we had occasionally also real sport in hunting wild boars in the part of the forest frequented by those animals | the first day i went out i killed a boar after narrowly escaping by a dexterous turn of my horse being killed myself | we killed a bear too and a puma or south american lion which next to the jaguar is the most savage animal in that continent and i had the satisfaction of presenting the skin to donna isabella | but our visit was at last to come to an end | very unwillingly so far as i was concerned did we bid our friends good bye and mount our horses to commence our journey |  i shall expect to hear great things of you senor barry said donna isabella as i bade her farewell |  the next campaign undertaken by bolivar will it is hoped complete the overthrow of the spaniards i am told |  the noble sentiments you hold will inspire me donna isabella i answered and if you will give me that feather from your hat i will ever wear it in battle and promise that it shall never be seen in flight | she smiling instantly gave it me and i fixed it securely in my hat | we were very young and i had of late become more romantic than i had ever before been | at last we had to ride forward two of our cousins accompanying us to the borders of the estate | as we were well mounted instead of taking the rougher but shorter road across the spurs of the mountains we had settled to strike down into the plain where we could gallop for a considerable distance and then keeping by the borders of a long lake return towards our own home | gerald who knew the way well said there were no insuperable difficulties to overcome though we might have to swim a stream or two |  but that as he observed is nothing when one is accustomed to it and you barry will have many a river to cross and many a marsh to wade through as well as mountains to climb and hundreds of miles to gallop over the prairie when you take service with general bermudez | he was right and i was glad to gain some experience as to the varieties of country i might have ere long to traverse | we were armed with pistols carbines and lances though gerald's arm was not strong enough to wield the latter with much effect but he could skilfully use his carbine when going at full gallop | we trusted however to the speed of our horses should we come in sight of any marauding party of the enemy and gerald declared that three or even four or five horsemen would not dare to attack us | he was indeed the most spirited little fellow i ever met and utterly fearless | as we galloped along we kept a look out over the plain for any horsemen who might appear |  i only wish two or three would come | cried gerald |  we would soon make the survivors turn to the right about for i am pretty sure we should kill a couple at least |  i hope that we shall not have anything of the sort to do i answered |  i am perfectly ready to fight when necessary in a right cause such as i believe that to be in which our friends are engaged but it is dreadful to contemplate killing people unless stern necessity compels us | warfare is terrible work at the best and the butcheries of which i have heard in this country show too well what men are capable of when their passions are excited | for my part though i have seen but little of fighting as yet i wish that peace were established |  oh you wouldn't do for a guerilla | exclaimed gerald in a somewhat contemptuous tone |  i shall not fight with less determination because i wish for peace i continued not minding him |  the only way to secure it is to beat our enemies and that i will do my best to accomplish when i have the opportunity |  that i am sure you will | exclaimed gerald sorry for his remark for though impulsive and in the habit of blurting out anything that came uppermost he was ever ready to acknowledge himself in the wrong | we galloped on for some leagues stopping occasionally to give our horses breath and then reached the borders of the lake i spoke of which extended for some distance parallel with the foot of the mountains and was fed by several streams which flowed from them | it was also connected by another stream with the smaller lake below our father's house | out of it likewise flowed a river of some size towards the east | we had forded two of these smaller streams without difficulty when we came to a wider and deeper one |  we shall have to swim for a little distance said gerald but our horses will perhaps carry us over on their backs | however if we find that our weight is too much for them we must slip off only we must remember to hold on tight by their manes and keep at their shoulders to avoid the unpleasant pats they might otherwise give us with their fore hoofs | and by the by it will be as well while we are on their backs to keep our feet as high up as we can lest an alligator should take a fancy to our toes though as the brutes are of no great size we haven't much to fear from them | i thought gerald was joking but he was perfectly in earnest though the danger we were to run did not in the slightest degree trouble him | i followed his advice when after wading a short distance my horse began to swim | shortly afterwards as its body was completely immersed i slipped off its back taking care to hold on to its mane near the crupper with one hand while i struck out with the other | gerald himself being so much lighter stuck on and guiding his horse to a shelving part of the bank regained the firm ground | i was still in the water when looking up the stream he shouted out to me make haste make haste barry | for here comes an ugly looking customer it would be as well not to encounter in the water | as may be supposed i was making all the haste i could for i had no fancy to remain in the river longer than necessary with the possibility of being seized by an alligator even though it might be one not large enough to swallow me at a gulp | i saw that gerald was more excited than usual: as he held his horse's bridle he kept stamping and moving about in his eagerness | i exerted myself to the utmost and at length had the satisfaction of finding my horse's feet touch the shore when i immediately scrambled on its back and rode up the bank |  look there | cried gerald that brute would be a more unpleasant opponent than even a big alligator | he pointed as he spoke to a huge serpent which i concluded was a boa constrictor coiled round the broken stem of a palm tree and with head erect floating leisurely down the river |  i only wish it would come nearer | exclaimed gerald |  i think i could manage to hit it and blow its head off | he fired as he spoke but missed and the serpent turning its head gave a hiss at us though it did not attempt to quit its raft | from the way it moved its tail which served as a rudder i believe that it could easily have guided itself to the shore and as it was big enough to have crushed not only one of us but either of our horses in its powerful folds i felt especially anxious to avoid it | gerald quickly reloaded his weapon |  fire barry fire | he cried out and if you miss i'll have another shot | as the snake though it was not likely to attack us might injure other people or destroy some cattle i took aim and fired but i merely grazed its head for it was a small mark to hit with a carbine | the creature then gave a hiss as if it did not like such treatment and whisking its tail urged its float towards the bank |  i say barry the brute's coming towards us cried gerald |  i'll have one more shot and if i miss we'd better gallop off for these snakes move with fearful rapidity through the grass and this one might catch hold of us in a way we shouldn't like | i was glad to find that gerald was as cautious as he was brave and considering his advice good i agreed to take to flight rather than risk an encounter with the serpent on dry land | i might transfix it with my lance as saint george did the dragon but i had no wish to engage in combat with the terrible beast | while i was reloading my carbine gerald fired |  missed again | he shouted now let's gallop for it the brute's in earnest and will have us if he can | we turned our horses' heads and digging our spurs into their flanks left the serpent should it land to search for us in vain | after going some distance we pulled rein and looked back but as we could nowhere see it we concluded that not discovering us on the shore it had continued its voyage to wherever it was bound |  i don't care for human foes or for any wild animals but these snakes are my detestation said gerald |  the boa and anaconda and the big tree snake are bad enough but there are others which on account of their bite are still worse | there is one called the aques seldom more than eight or ten feet long which is the most savage creature imaginable and its fangs are so deadly that a person seldom lives more than a few hours after being bitten | not only will the creature spring out upon a passer by but it will follow him to a considerable distance and then fly at his throat and kill him unless he has a long stick to defend himself | the indians and blacks are with good reason mortally afraid of the aques | i have often seen them but never had a fight with one though i shouldn't care about it provided i was armed with a long tough stick | i confessed that i should not wish to make the near acquaintance of so terrible a reptile but young as he was gerald had shot a jaguar and a puma on each occasion while quite alone and several smaller wild animals such as black bears boars peccaries and tiger cats | he had numerous trophies of his skill to exhibit | no wonder that tim was proud of him | he had greatly the advantage of me as a sportsman but though our father and mother had done their best to instruct him he was sadly behind hand in general knowledge and book learning such as i had had the opportunity of gaining at school | notwithstanding this we got on very well together and there was no fear i hoped of our ever falling out | he looked up to me as superior to him in many points and i regarded him with admiration for his courage and hardihood and excellent temper | we had proceeded for some way along the banks of the lake when we caught sight of a boat in the distance apparently crossing to reach a point ahead of us | we could distinguish four people in the boat which came on rather slowly | this was accounted for when we made out several horses swimming in the water astern | the lake was bordered by a fringe of reeds which in some places grew some distance into the water over which water fowl of various species winged their flight while we observed several pink tinted flamingoes stalking with long legs in the shallows: and as we were watching the boat a large flight of these beautiful birds came swooping along through the air | being curious to know who was in the boat we rode slowly on towards the landing place from whence gerald told me the road led past the end of the lake to our house | as we reached the spot the boat approached and looking at the only passenger it contained i at once recognised the countenance of dr stutterheim while his canine friend jumbo was standing in the bow of the boat |  what doctor | is that you | i shouted out |  ah my young friend i am very glad to see you he exclaimed standing up and waving his hand |  i am coming to take advantage of your invitation | but i will tell you all about it when i get on shore | in another minute the boat touched the bank when the doctor leaping on dry ground dragged two of his horses out of the water by the long reins which secured them a black man whom i found to be his attendant leading the third | shaking hands warmly with the doctor i introduced gerald while jumbo acknowledged me as an acquaintance by leaping up and energetically whisking his tail | the boatmen then assisted in loading the baggage animals with several chests the doctor had brought and having paid the men he dismissed them and mounted his horse |  now heliogabalus follow me and see that none of the baggage falls off you black villain said the doctor | the black having examined the thongs which secured the baggage climbed up on the back of one of the animals and followed us as we rode on |  i sometimes call him heliogabalus said the doctor but he is generally known by the name of gab which is a more convenient appellation for ordinary use | i picked him up on the road to santa fe | i have no great faith in his honesty but as i wanted an attendant i engaged him though i strongly suspect he is a runaway and very likely may be reclaimed by his owner |  i don't admire him for his beauty i answered |  now tell me doctor to what happy circumstance are we indebted for the pleasure of seeing you so soon |  simply because i found it dangerous to remain longer in santa fe he answered |  i got no practice or rather no payment from my patients and i thought it very probable that i should be led out and shot by the spaniards on suspicion of being a liberal as was the case with many unfortunate people while i was there | i determined therefore to continue my journey through the country and gain a further knowledge of its natural history and productions keeping if possible out of the way of the combatants | i should have preferred travelling in more peaceable times but as life is short i might not have an opportunity were i to defer my travels till the spaniards are driven out of the country and peace is restored | of course i told him that under any circumstances we were very glad to see him and it at once occurred to me that should our captive indian be still alive the doctor might by his superior skill assist to cure him |  i have a grand remedy which if he has still some breath in his body is almost sure to succeed he answered |  what is it | i asked |  to let nature take its course he replied |  perhaps your friends have been doctoring him overmuch but i shall judge when i see him | it was late when we reached our house and my father to whom i had before described the doctor gave him a hearty welcome | i was thankful to hear that the indian was still alive though in a very weak state so the doctor was at once taken in to see him | having examined his wound and felt his pulse he observed i see all about it | we will give him stimulants which will set the machine agoing | you have been afraid of fever and have kept him too low | i will answer for it that in a few days he will be ready to perform his war dance and flourish his scalping knife with as much energy as ever | norah who heard this remark assured the doctor that she believed his patient had become perfectly civilised mild and gentle |  oh yes while he is in this house and in your presence young lady but let him get back to his old haunts among his savage companions and he will cut throats with as much zest as ever replied the doctor | at the supper table my father inquired what news the doctor brought from bogota |  judging from the cruelties inflicted on their prisoners the spaniards know that they are losing ground he answered |  it is bad enough when they shoot men taken in arms but the day before i left i witnessed a sight which made my blood boil with indignation and i am not apt to feel such sensations i assure you | a young lady it appears residing in the city was accused of favouring the patriot cause and of giving information to its leaders of being a spy in fact | a letter she had written to bolivar was stopped and the bearer confessed that it had been intrusted to him to deliver by her | she was immediately arrested and brought before the judge | she was young and beautiful very beautiful indeed i assure you and i should have thought that her appearance alone would have softened the heart of the greatest tyrant | i expected to hear her plead her innocence with tears in her eyes imploring for mercy but instead she stood calm and unmoved and boldly acknowledged herself a patriot and ready to die if required so that she might know her beloved country would gain its freedom | not one among those collected at the trial dared to utter a word in her favour: she was condemned to die and was forthwith led out to undergo the sentence just pronounced | she bowed her head proudly not a limb trembling not a tear dropping from her eye | it was granted her as a favour that she should be shot on account of her rank and the high estimation in which she was held | a priest was sent for but she refused his services observing that she had counted the cost and had made full preparation for the fate which awaited her should she be discovered her only regret being that she could no longer serve the cause in which she gloried |  do you leave no one behind you who will mourn your loss '| asked her military judge with cruel irony in his tone for it was known that she was engaged to marry a young and handsome colonel of the republican army |  who was she | i exclaimed eagerly my heart sinking as i heard the doctor say this what was her name |  donna paola salabriata he answered |  without being allowed to take a last farewell of her friends or to communicate with any one she was led out into the great square followed by a party of soldiers continued the doctor not observing my agitation |  she entreated as a favour that her eyes might not be bound and facing her executioners she stood with her arms crossed on her fair bosom without for a moment exhibiting the slightest fear | i could not have believed that any woman would have shown courage so undaunted and yet be so gentle and modest in all her actions | stoical and indifferent as i am i could scarcely refrain from shouting to the rescue '| and rushing forward to preserve her but i remembered in time that i should certainly be shot did i make the attempt | and so rooted to the spot and feeling as if i were turning into stone i waited till the fatal word should be given | could any being in the form of man as he beheld that young creature in all her maiden beauty utter that word | could those swarthy soldiers savage as they looked pull a trigger to deprive her of life |yes  and the officer who perhaps was a husband perhaps a father in a loud voice which sounded to me like the shriek of a demon gave the order to fire | then came the rattle of musketry and a cloud of smoke and the fair young girl pierced by a dozen wounds sank lifeless on the ground | the officer advanced to ascertain that she was dead followed by the soldiers to plunge their bayonets into her had she shown any signs of life | but death had been merciful and the still lovely corpse for not a shot had struck her countenance was placed on a bier and carried away for interment | as the doctor finished his thrilling narrative unable longer to restrain myself i burst into tears at the thought of one so young so lovely and so devoted to a noble cause having been thus cruelly put to death | my heart bled too for young colonel acosta | i reflected on the agony he must endure the bitter desire for vengeance which must animate his bosom | i little fancied at the time that he was my cousin and that i should be by his side on the field of battle when in the hour of victory he cast his last fond look at the miniature of the lovely girl whom he had hoped one day to make his bride ere she was foully murdered by those who were now about to be driven for ever from the land | but i anticipate events | the account we had heard excited feelings of grief and indignation in all our family | norah was weeping bitterly she had known donna paola | even had she not known her she would have wept at the tale and wished as i did to aid in driving our tyrants from the land | i suspect that had my worthy schoolmaster been present his sympathies would have been with us and he would not have advised me to remain neutral in the struggle | but i must quit the subject i cannot even at the present day speak of it without a choking sensation rising in my bosom | the doctor looked surprised at the effect his narrative had produced and he expressed his regret that he should have spoken of her when i told him that i had but lately met donna paola |  now we will talk of something else he said |  your brother seems to be a great sportsman for one so young mr barry | i hope that he will assist me in obtaining specimens of natural history and enable me to gain a further knowledge of the habits of the quadrupeds and quadrumana and of the feathered tribes of this region |  i shall be very happy to accompany you doctor either into the forests or over the plains or up the mountains or on the shores of the lakes whenever you wish to go said gerald |  i should be ready to go to morrow but i must not neglect my patient answered the doctor |  and he will require my care for a few days and trust me i will do my best to cure him | the rest of the evening was spent in talking of our proposed shooting excursion | some days elapsed however before we could set out | the doctor was most attentive to the wounded indian who was now evidently recovering under his superintendence | still he seemed to regard norah as his chief nurse and though he hesitated to take what the doctor prescribed for him from any one else he received it willingly from her hands | at last the doctor pronounced him convalescent and declared that he no longer needed his care |  and so my young friends he said turning to us one evening while we sat at supper we will lose no more time out set off immediately | life is short remember |  carpe diem' should be the motto of all who desire to gain information | i agreed to accompany the doctor and gerald and before retiring to rest that night we made arrangements | tim also on hearing of our plan begged to go being afraid that gerald would get into some scrape | the doctor of course intended to take jumbo | i asked him if gab was to go also |  i have not tried him yet and i think it is possible if i put a gun into his hands that he might shoot me instead of a jaguar should one appear before us he replied | i confess i thought that possible for i did not particularly like the appearance of mr heliogabalus | my father employed a number of blacks on his estate as did my uncle for they found them far more trustworthy and industrious than the so called christianised natives | gab soon made himself at home among his fellow blacks but they from the first looked upon him with some degree of suspicion for which i could not account they very probably had more insight into his character than either his master or i had | we started early the next morning with a small quantity of provisions consisting chiefly of flour and biscuits a pot in which to boil our cocoa and some cups to drink it out of some condiments such as pepper and salt and plenty of powder and shot | we expected to kill sufficient game to supply ourselves with substantial food | we were all mounted as we could leg strap our horses while we shot or leave them under charge of a black servant who accompanied us with a sumpter horse to carry our larger game as also the skins of any animals the doctor might wish to preserve | we agreed to camp out for a couple of nights and then return home | i must not stop to describe the numerous birds we saw on the lake along the shores of which we took our way the flamingoes spoonbills herons and several varieties of water fowl | among others we saw some little herons as white as snow which the doctor assured me were great friends of the alligators | before long we caught sight of a number of these saurians lying on a bank in the sun and while we were watching them several of the beautiful birds perched on their backs and went walking composedly along as if they mistook them for trunks of trees | the alligators were much smaller than those i had seen in the magdalena and both gerald and tim assured us that they never attacked human beings | having left our horses in charge of our black servant chumbo we set off to get a shot at the wild fowl some of which the doctor wanted to stuff while we agreed they would also serve us for dinner | the reeds being very high we soon lost sight of each other | i had gone some way supposing that i was at a distance from my companions and was on the point of firing at some wild fowl which rose in the air when just close to the water i heard the doctor shout out in a voice of terror which i was sure he would not have done without good cause | i rushed forward as fast as i could through the reeds when what was my horror to see an enormous anaconda capable of swallowing a foal or a young calf at a gulp with its head raised within a few feet of his shoulders and apparently about to seize him in its deadly embrace | either his gun was unloaded or terror prevented him from using it | hastily ramming a bullet down my fowling piece i raised it to fire hoping earnestly that i might take good aim | my worthy friend's life depended on my doing: so for in another instant the monster might envelop him in its huge folds | i shall not forget in a hurry the look of horror depicted in the worthy doctor's countenance | taking steady aim i fired and the bullet happily went crashing through the anaconda's head | though the creature was not killed its head dropped and the doctor had time to spring forward and escape its fangs which almost grazed his arm | i shouted to him while i was reloading my gun | in a moment he was himself again and imitating my example got his weapon ready to fire down the serpent's throat should it again lift its head | it quickly gave him an opportunity and the second shot had the effect of making it roll over and over in a most extraordinary fashion | i was glad to keep out of its way and so was the doctor whom by making a circuit i rejoined |  i hope this marsh is not frequented by other snakes of the same species he observed |  if it is i propose that we beat a retreat while we can do so with whole bones | but i should like to have that fellow's skin it would be a prize worth possessing | however i don't feel inclined to approach it nearer |  nor do i but probably in a few minutes it will be dead i said |  not quite sure of that replied the doctor serpents have wonderful vitality | but if we could get near enough to cut off its tail we should soon kill it | i undertook to make the attempt | having a sharp axe in my belt while the doctor stood ready to fire should it raise its head i rushed forward and severed the tail about six feet from the end | in an instant its movements ceased and its coils gradually relaxed |  bravo barry | the piece you've cut off would make a good sized serpent of itself shouted the doctor holding it up |  if we could skin it we might carry it home | while we were speaking jumbo who had been at a distance came jumping up and barked furiously at the dead serpent | i rather suspect that having seen the creature he had bolted not unwisely for it would have swallowed him at a gulp | i hinted this to the doctor who at first repudiated the idea but acknowledged that jumbo was more experienced with regard to alligators than anacondas | our shots and shouts had been heard by gerald and tim who now appeared and congratulated the doctor on his escape |  i owe it to my friend barry's coolness and courage he answered |  i shall ever be grateful to him and he described how i had shot the anaconda | the doctor seemed so anxious to have the skin that we all set to work and cut it off together with the head | to me it was a disagreeable operation as i was unaccustomed to it but the rest of the party took it as a matter of course | having scraped it as clean as we could we bore it in triumph to where we had left the horses | they snorted as they saw it and the animal on whose back we fastened it did not seem much to like its burden | our negro servant gazed on it with horror and astonishment declaring that he had never seen so large a serpent | we agreed that as there might be others in the neighbourhood it would be wise not to remain among the reeds especially as gerald and tim had shot as many wild fowl as we required for supper | we accordingly proceeded on towards a forest which bordered the bank of a stream running into the lake and here we intended to encamp for the night | chapter five | camp at night shoot two tapirs the doctor's lecture visit padre pacheco's house he has disappeared a night at a hunter's hut return home gab accused of treachery humming birds kanimapo appears warns me of an intended attack on our house we collect men and go to castle concannan prepare for its defence we see our house burning aqualonga and his banditti appear commence the attack we drive them back with one of our guns they assault the back of the house gab escapes a battering ram brought into play out buildings on fire several of our men killed and wounded our ammunition runs short a fresh assault enemy retreat we follow regain the house enemy return driven back and disappear the dead buried | we were well satisfied with the success we had enjoyed during the day having shot as many birds as we required for the pot and several others of various species | we had half a dozen different sorts of animals which the doctor wished to examine or to add to his museum | there were among them three monkeys a titi a minas leonidas a miniature lion a curious little creature a spider monkey with white whiskers besides a paca a small rodent which burrows in the ground and an opossum with a prehensile tail which we saw with half a dozen little ones on its back | the doctor observed that having no pouch it thus carries its young and is from this circumstance called dorsigereas or back bearing | the young ones were clinging on to her with their hand like feet while their tails were turned round hers and thus she was making her way along the branch of a tree when the doctor's cruel rifle cut short her career | i confess that i could not have had the heart to kill the creature nor did i much like shooting the playful little monkeys but the doctor observed that such sentiments must yield to the necessities of science and that they might consider it a great honour to have their skins exhibited in the museum of berlin | having kindled a fire we were busily employed till a late hour by its light in skinning the doctor's prizes | the paca by the by was roasted and preferred to the ducks | with our ponchos and horse rugs we formed luxurious couches though the mosquitoes were somewhat troublesome | the doctor was entering into a learned disquisition as to their species | the inner need is built up of three mystical elements: 1 every artist as a creator has something in him which calls for expression this is the element of personality |  2 every artist as child of his age is impelled to express the spirit of his age this is the element of style dictated by the period and particular country to which the artist belongs it is doubtful how long the latter distinction will continue to exist |  3 every artist as a servant of art has to help the cause of art this is the element of pure artistry which is constant in all ages and among all nationalities | a full understanding of the first two elements is necessary for a realization of the third | but he who has this realization will recognize that a rudely carved indian column is an expression of the same spirit as actuates any real work of art of today | in the past and even today much talk is heard of personality in art | talk of the coming style becomes more frequent daily | but for all their importance today these questions will have disappeared after a few hundred or thousand years | only the third element that of pure artistry will remain for ever | an egyptian carving speaks to us today more subtly than it did to its chronological contemporaries for they judged it with the hampering knowledge of period and personality | but we can judge purely as an expression of the eternal artistry | similarly the greater the part played in a modern work of art by the two elements of style and personality the better will it be appreciated by people today but a modern work of art which is full of the third element will fail to reach the contemporary soul | for many centuries have to pass away before the third element can be received with understanding | but the artist in whose work this third element predominates is the really great artist | because the elements of style and personality make up what is called the periodic characteristics of any work of art the development of artistic forms must depend on their separation from the element of pure artistry which knows neither period nor nationality | but as style and personality create in every epoch certain definite forms which for all their superficial differences are really closely related these forms can be spoken of as one side of art the subjective | every artist chooses from the forms which reflect his own time those which are sympathetic to him and expresses himself through them | so the subjective element is the definite and external expression of the inner objective element | the inevitable desire for outward expression of the objective element is the impulse here defined as the inner need | the forms it borrows change from day to day and as it continually advances what is today a phrase of inner harmony becomes tomorrow one of outer harmony | it is clear therefore that the inner spirit of art only uses the outer form of any particular period as a stepping stone to further expression | in short the working of the inner need and the development of art is an ever advancing expression of the eternal and objective in the terms of the periodic and subjective | because the objective is forever exchanging the subjective expression of today for that of tomorrow each new extension of liberty in the use of outer form is hailed as the last and supreme | at present we say that an artist can use any form he wishes so long as he remains in touch with nature | but this limitation like all its predecessors is only temporary | from the point of view of the inner need no limitation must be made | the artist may use any form which his expression demands for his inner impulse must find suitable outward expression | so we see that a deliberate search for personality and style is not only impossible but comparatively unimportant | the close relationship of art throughout the ages is not a relationship in outward form but in inner meaning | and therefore the talk of schools of lines of development of principles of art etc is based on misunderstanding and can only lead to confusion | the artist must be blind to distinctions between recognized or unrecognized conventions of form deaf to the transitory teaching and demands of his particular age | he must watch only the trend of the inner need and hearken to its words alone | then he will with safety employ means both sanctioned and forbidden by his contemporaries | all means are sacred which are called for by the inner need | all means are sinful which obscure that inner need | it is impossible to theorize about this ideal of art | in real art theory does not precede practice but follows her | everything is at first a matter of feeling | any theoretical scheme will be lacking in the essential of creation the inner desire for expression which cannot be determined | neither the quality of the inner need nor its subjective form can be measured nor weighed |  footnote: the many sided genius of leonardo devised a system of little spoons with which different colours were to be used thus creating a kind of mechanical harmony | one of his pupils after trying in vain to use this system in despair asked one of his colleagues how the master himself used the invention | the colleague replied: the master never uses it at all |  mereschowski leonardo da vinci | such a grammar of painting can only be temporarily guessed at and should it ever be achieved it will be not so much according to physical rules which have so often been tried and which today the cubists are trying as according to the rules of the inner need which are of the soul | the inner need is the basic alike of small and great problems in painting | we are seeking today for the road which is to lead us away from the outer to the inner basis |  footnote: the term outer here used must not be confused with the term material used previously | i am using the former to mean outer need which never goes beyond conventional limits nor produces other than conventional beauty | the inner need knows no such limits and often produces results conventionally considered ugly | but ugly itself is a conventional term and only means spiritually unsympathetic being applied to some expression of an inner need either outgrown or not yet attained | but everything which adequately expresses the inner need is beautiful | the spirit like the body can be strengthened and developed by frequent exercise | just as the body if neglected grows weaker and finally impotent so the spirit perishes if untended | and for this reason it is necessary for the artist to know the starting point for the exercise of his spirit | the starting point is the study of colour and its effects on men | there is no need to engage in the finer shades of complicated colour but rather at first to consider only the direct use of simple colours | to begin with let us test the working on ourselves of individual colours and so make a simple chart which will facilitate the consideration of the whole question | two great divisions of colour occur to the mind at the outset: into warm and cold and into light and dark | to each colour there are therefore four shades of appeal warm and light or warm and dark or cold and light or cold and dark | generally speaking warmth or cold in a colour means an approach respectively to yellow or to blue | this distinction is so to speak on one basis the colour having a constant fundamental appeal but assuming either a more material or more non material quality | the movement is an horizontal one the warm colours approaching the spectator the cold ones retreating from him | the colours which cause in another colour this horizontal movement while they are themselves affected by it have another movement of their own which acts with a violent separative force | this is therefore the first antithesis in the inner appeal and the inclination of the colour to yellow or to blue is of tremendous importance | the second antithesis is between white and black i e the inclination to light or dark caused by the pair of colours just mentioned | these colours have once more their peculiar movement to and from the spectator but in a more rigid form see fig |1  figure i first pair of antitheses |  inner appeal acting on a and b the spirit a warm cold yellow blue first antithesis two movements: i horizontal towards the spectator away from the spectator bodily spiritual yellow blue ii ex and concentric b light dark white black second antithesis two movements: i discordant eternal discord but with absolute discord devoid possibilities for the white black of possibilities for the future birth future death ii ex and concentric as in case of yellow and blue but more rigid | yellow and blue have another movement which affects the first antithesis an ex and concentric movement | if two circles are drawn and painted respectively yellow and blue brief concentration will reveal in the yellow a spreading movement out from the centre and a noticeable approach to the spectator | the blue on the other hand moves in upon itself like a snail retreating into its shell and draws away from the spectator |  footnote: these statements have no scientific basis but are founded purely on spiritual experience | in the case of light and dark colours the movement is emphasized | that of the yellow increases with an admixture of white i e as it becomes lighter | that of the blue increases with an admixture of black i e as it becomes darker | this means that there can never be a dark coloured yellow | the relationship between white and yellow is as close as between black and blue for blue can be so dark as to border on black | besides this physical relationship is also a spiritual one between yellow and white on one side between blue and black on the other which marks a strong separation between the two pairs | an attempt to make yellow colder produces a green tint and checks both the horizontal and excentric movement | the colour becomes sickly and unreal | the blue by its contrary movement acts as a brake on the yellow and is hindered in its own movement till the two together become stationary and the result is green | similarly a mixture of black and white produces gray which is motionless and spiritually very similar to green | but while green yellow and blue are potentially active though temporarily paralysed in gray there is no possibility of movement because gray consists of two colours that have no active force for they stand the one in motionless discord the other in a motionless negation even of discord like an endless wall or a bottomless pit | because the component colours of green are active and have a movement of their own it is possible on the basis of this movement to reckon their spiritual appeal | the first movement of yellow that of approach to the spectator which can be increased by an intensification of the yellow and also the second movement that of over spreading the boundaries have a material parallel in the human energy which assails every obstacle blindly and bursts forth aimlessly in every direction | yellow if steadily gazed at in any geometrical form has a disturbing influence and reveals in the colour an insistent aggressive character |  footnote: it is worth noting that the sour tasting lemon and shrill singing canary are both yellow | the intensification of the yellow increases the painful shrillness of its note |  footnote: any parallel between colour and music can only be relative | just as a violin can give various shades of tone so yellow has shades which can be expressed by various instruments | but in making such parallels i am assuming in each case a pure tone of colour or sound unvaried by vibration or dampers etc | yellow is the typically earthly colour | it can never have profound meaning | an intermixture of blue makes it a sickly colour | it may be paralleled in human nature with madness not with melancholy or hypochondriacal mania but rather with violent raving lunacy | the power of profound meaning is found in blue and first in its physical movements 1 of retreat from the spectator 2 of turning in upon its own centre | the inclination of blue to depth is so strong that its inner appeal is stronger when its shade is deeper | blue is the typical heavenly colour |  footnote: the halos are golden for emperors and prophets i e | for mortals and sky blue for symbolic figures i e | spiritual beings kondakoff histoire de l'an byzantine consideree principalement dans les miniatures vol | ii p | 382 paris 1886 91 | the ultimate feeling it creates is one of rest |  footnote: supernatural rest not the earthly contentment of green | the way to the supernatural lies through the natural | and we mortals passing from the earthly yellow to the heavenly blue must pass through green | when it sinks almost to black it echoes a grief that is hardly human |  footnote: as an echo of grief violet stand to blue as does green in its production of rest | when it rises towards white a movement little suited to it its appeal to men grows weaker and more distant | in music a light blue is like a flute a darker blue a cello a still darker a thunderous double bass and the darkest blue of all an organ | a well balanced mixture of blue and yellow produces green | the horizontal movement ceases likewise that from and towards the centre | the effect on the soul through the eye is therefore motionless | this is a fact recognized not only by opticians but by the world | green is the most restful colour that exists | on exhausted men this restfulness has a beneficial effect but after a time it becomes wearisome | pictures painted in shades of green are passive and tend to be wearisome this contrasts with the active warmth of yellow or the active coolness of blue | in the hierarchy of colours green is the bourgeoisie self satisfied immovable narrow | it is the colour of summer the period when nature is resting from the storms of winter and the productive energy of spring cf |fig 2  any preponderance in green of yellow or blue introduces a corresponding activity and changes the inner appeal | the green keeps its characteristic equanimity and restfulness the former increasing with the inclination to lightness the latter with the inclination to depth | in music the absolute green is represented by the placid middle notes of a violin | black and white have already been discussed in general terms | more particularly speaking white although often considered as no colour a theory largely due to the impressionists who saw no white in nature as a symbol of a world from which all colour as a definite attribute has disappeared |  footnote: van gogh in his letters asks whether he may not paint a white wall dead white | this question offers no difficulty to the non representative artist who is concerned only with the inner harmony of colour | but to the impressionist realist it seems a bold liberty to take with nature | to him it seems as outrageous as his own change from brown shadows to blue seemed to his contemporaries | van gogh's question marks a transition from impressionism to an art of spiritual harmony as the coming of the blue shadow marked a transition from academism to impressionism | cf  the letters of vincent van gogh | constable london | this world is too far above us for its harmony to touch our souls | a great silence like an impenetrable wall shrouds its life from our understanding | white therefore has this harmony of silence which works upon us negatively like many pauses in music that break temporarily the melody | it is not a dead silence but one pregnant with possibilities | white has the appeal of the nothingness that is before birth of the world in the ice age | a totally dead silence on the other hand a silence with no possibilities has the inner harmony of black | in music it is represented by one of those profound and final pauses after which any continuation of the melody seems the dawn of another world | black is something burnt out like the ashes of a funeral pyre something motionless like a corpse | the silence of black is the silence of death | outwardly black is the colour with least harmony of all a kind of neutral background against which the minutest shades of other colours stand clearly forward | it differs from white in this also for with white nearly every colour is in discord or even mute altogether |  footnote: e g | vermilion rings dull and muddy against white but against black with clear strength | light yellow against white is weak against black pure and brilliant | not without reason is white taken as symbolizing joy and spotless purity and black grief and death | a blend of black and white produces gray which as has been said is silent and motionless being composed of two inactive colours its restfulness having none of the potential activity of green | a similar gray is produced by a mixture of green and red a spiritual blend of passivity and glowing warmth |  footnote: gray immobility and rest | delacroix sought to express rest by a mixture of green and red cf | signac sup |cit  the unbounded warmth of red has not the irresponsible appeal of yellow but rings inwardly with a determined and powerful intensity it glows in itself maturely and does not distribute its vigour aimlessly see fig |2  the varied powers of red are very striking | by a skillful use of it in its different shades its fundamental tone may be made warm or cold |  footnote: of course every colour can be to some extent varied between warm and cold but no colour has so extensive a scale of varieties as red | light warm red has a certain similarity to medium yellow alike in texture and appeal and gives a feeling of strength vigour determination triumph | in music it is a sound of trumpets strong harsh and ringing | vermilion is a red with a feeling of sharpness like glowing steel which can be cooled by water | vermilion is quenched by blue for it can support no mixture with a cold colour | more accurately speaking such a mixture produces what is called a dirty colour scorned by painters of today | but dirt as a material object has its own inner appeal and therefore to avoid it in painting is as unjust and narrow as was the cry of yesterday for pure colour | at the call of the inner need that which is outwardly foul may be inwardly pure and vice versa | the two shades of red just discussed are similar to yellow except that they reach out less to the spectator | the glow of red is within itself | for this reason it is a colour more beloved than yellow being frequently used in primitive and traditional decoration and also in peasant costumes because in the open air the harmony of red and green is very beautiful | taken by itself this red is material and like yellow has no very deep appeal | only when combined with something nobler does it acquire this deep appeal | it is dangerous to seek to deepen red by an admixture of black for black quenches the glow or at least reduces it considerably | but there remains brown unemotional disinclined for movement | an intermixture of red is outwardly barely audible but there rings out a powerful inner harmony | skillful blending can produce an inner appeal of extraordinary indescribable beauty | the vermilion now rings like a great trumpet or thunders like a drum | cool red madder like any other fundamentally cold colour can be deepened especially by an intermixture of azure | the character of the colour changes the inward glow increases the active element gradually disappears | but this active element is never so wholly absent as in deep green | there always remains a hint of renewed vigour somewhere out of sight waiting for a certain moment to burst forth afresh | in this lies the great difference between a deepened red and a deepened blue because in red there is always a trace of the material | a parallel in music are the sad middle tones of a cello | a cold light red contains a very distinct bodily or material element but it is always pure like the fresh beauty of the face of a young girl | the singing notes of a violin express this exactly in music | warm red intensified by a suitable yellow is orange | this blend brings red almost to the point of spreading out towards the spectator | but the element of red is always sufficiently strong to keep the colour from flippancy | orange is like a man convinced of his own powers | its note is that of the angelus or of an old violin | just as orange is red brought nearer to humanity by yellow so violet is red withdrawn from humanity by blue | but the red in violet must be cold for the spiritual need does not allow of a mixture of warm red with cold blue | violet is therefore both in the physical and spiritual sense a cooled red | it is consequently rather sad and ailing | it is worn by old women and in china as a sign of mourning | in music it is an english horn or the deep notes of wood instruments e g | a bassoon |  footnote: among artists one often hears the question how are you | answered gloomily by the words feeling very

whether you can hold it against a determined attack | would it not be wiser for you to unite with your brothers in law and assist in defending their house which you may do successfully | it is far more capable of resisting an enemy and pardon me i think it will be madness to attempt to hold out here when you have their house in which you can take refuge |  doctor you are right exclaimed my father |  they can but burn this down and they will not have time to destroy the plantations | i am grateful to you for your counsel | we will carry it out | entering the house my father communicated to my mother and norah the intelligence i had brought and desired them to prepare with the children for instant flight while he went out to call in the blacks whom he could trust | i meantime having found tim hastened off to the village where there were nearly a score of men who would be ready tim assured me to fight in our cause | the news we brought spread consternation among the people: some immediately began to pack up their property with the intention of flying into the woods to conceal themselves while the braver portion many of them young men who had already served with the insurgent forces hurried to get their arms and ammunition and to follow us | the village was so open that it could not be effectually protected unless with a far larger force than the inhabitants could muster and they knew therefore that they must abandon their own houses to pillage if they would preserve their lives | it was a hard fate but it had been the lot of so many others of late years that they did not repine | i was thankful to find in the course of a few minutes twenty stout hardy looking fellows chiefly creoles and mulattoes pretty well armed either with guns blunderbusses pistols swords or spears | all had one or two weapons which they knew how to use and were thoroughly imbued with a true hatred of the gothos as they called the spaniards and all those who sided with them | the bandit aqualonga they especially detested from the numberless atrocities he had committed and for which he had been rewarded by the king of spain with a colonel's commission a handsome uniform and occasional pay | these signal marks of favour had encouraged him to continue his career | bermudez and other patriot chiefs had hitherto in vain attempted to hunt him down | he was active and intelligent and supported by his band of cut throats spaniards mulattoes indians and blacks had long evaded pursuit and had appeared now in one part of the country now in the other where he had committed fresh outrages on the unfortunate inhabitants | i feared that as he had now come into our neighbourhood if kanimapo was rightly informed he would attack don fernando's house from which he would obtain a richer booty than from ours or castle concannan | i mentioned my fears to tim |  it may be masther barry but if he pays castle concannan a visit first it's my belief that we'll be after giving him such a drubbing that he'll have no stomach for attacking any other place | we've a good store of ammunition at our house and your uncles have a still larger and with forty or well nigh fifty true men inside the four walls we shall be able to keep the enemy employed as long as they venture to stay within gun shot | on reaching the house we found my mother and norah mounted | each of them held one of the children while the rest of the horses were laden with the ammunition and some of the more valuable property | i could nowhere find the doctor and asked what had become of him | presently i saw him returning with four blacks |  i went away for an especial object he said: to hide my chests of natural history | the rogues would have broken them open expecting to find them full of treasure or should they burn the house their contents would have been destroyed: so i thought the best way would be to conceal them in the woods as i could not ask your father to convey them | i congratulated him on his forethought and it then occurred to me to ask what had become of gab |  oh the villain | i forgot all about him | exclaimed the doctor |  he still remains shut up | should the banditti destroy the house he will be burned alive |  common humanity forbids that we should allow him to be thus put to death | we must take him with us observed my father |  he would only meet with his deserts remarked the doctor |  however as it won't do to let him be at liberty i will bring him out | the doctor hurried into the house and quickly returned driving gab before him with a rope fastened round his wrists so that though he could use his feet he could not run away | the order was now given to advance my mother and sister with the children being placed in the centre while our own servants and the villagers marched on either side for though we hoped to reach castle concannan in safety we could not tell at what moment aqualonga and his band might arrive | my father cast a regretful look at his house which he was thus leaving to destruction | tim who observed it cried out faith masther dear better to let the house burn than to lose all our lives which would have happened maybe into the bargain so we'll just hope to live and fight another day and go back and build it up again before long | my father giving tim a friendly nod turned away his head and pushed forward to the front while the doctor and i brought up the rear | he was too good a soldier to omit sending out scouts to bring us timely notice of the approach of an enemy but we pushed on as fast as we could move with our firelocks ready for instant use hoping that even if attacked we might fight our way to castle concannan the distance not being great | our anxiety was soon relieved by our arrival at our destination | my eldest uncle came out to receive us | gerald had faithfully delivered our father's message and they had immediately set to work to put the place in a state of defence | all the timber that could be collected had been brought in to barricade the windows and doors and they had already begun to remove part of the roof which was thatched and which as it could easily be set on fire by arrows with burning tips was likely to prove dangerous | the considerable force we brought enabled these operations to be rapidly carried on | the thatch was conveyed to a distance from the house that it might not be employed for smoking us out while all the men able to use saws and hammers set to work to fit and nail up the timbers | every door and window was so strongly barricaded that a cannon shot only could have knocked them in | my uncle had fortunately two small field pieces | to enable these to be used with effect ports were cut in the lower part of the doors on either side with traps or portcullises to mask them till it was necessary to run them out and fire | all the windows were loopholed and a number of large stones and bricks taken from the walls of the outhouses were carried up to the roof to be hurled down on the heads of our assailants should they attempt to escalade the walls | our men were then divided into four parties that should the house be attacked on every side at once it might be effectually defended | uncle denis had charge of one of the guns and as i had learned to load and fire one on board ship i had command of the other with gerald and tim under me | the preparations occupied us the greater part of the night and not till towards morning did we consider that the house was placed in a proper state of defence | my mother and sisters as well as my aunts and cousins had rendered all the assistance in their power and they now begged that they might be stationed in the upper part of the house so as to throw stones on the heads of the enemy should they approach the walls | to this however my father and uncles would not consent as they would thus be exposed to the shot of our assailants |  your proper duty ladies will be to help me should any of our garrison be wounded observed the doctor |  the fittest place will be the centre of the house where you yourselves will run the least risk of being hurt | we cannot allow you to be exposed to danger if it can be avoided | to this they somewhat unwillingly agreed and our minds were greatly relieved by believing that as long as we could hold out they would be safe | the command of the fortress was entrusted by my uncles to my father who having seen so much fighting in his younger days was considered the best soldier of the party while uncle denis and i acted as his lieutenants | the order was now given to those of the men who wished to do so to lie down and rest while we kept a look out from the battlements for so i may call the upper part of the house that the enemy might not take us by surprise | it was as i have said a square strongly built stone house with a courtyard on one side beyond which were several out buildings | had we possessed a stronger force these would have been fortified and occupied but as it was we had only men sufficient to garrison the house and we were compelled to leave these to their fate | our horses were brought inside as were several mules but the rest of the live stock the oxen pigs sheep and goats had to be deserted | the house stood on slightly elevated ground sloping away gradually on three sides the fourth being that on which the courtyard was situated | the night was drawing on but as yet we had seen no signs of an enemy | it was possible that after all aqualonga and his band might not come they might have encountered some of the patriot troops and been driven back | we hoped that such might be the case | i was looking out on the side turned towards our house when gerald joined me |  i can't sleep for thinking of the work we are to be engaged in he said |  after all the trouble we have taken it will be quite a pity if the banditti disappoint us |  i cannot quite agree with you i answered |  remember that they are not likely to come here till they have paid our house a visit and if they go there they are sure to burn it in revenge at finding us gone and nothing within which they greatly value | as i was speaking i observed a bright light in the direction of our house and pointed it out to gerald |  what do you think that means | i asked |  i don't know he said |  perhaps some native with a torch going through the woods |  i fear very much that it will increase i answered | see  it is already doing so | gerald i am afraid aqualonga and his party have really come and finding that we have escaped have in revenge set fire to our house | i trust that they will not treat the whole village in the same way | it is bad enough for those who have friends to go to but it will be sad indeed for the poor people to be burned out of their homes |  you take things very coolly barry exclaimed gerald |  the villains | can they have dared to burn our house | i hope that they will come here and we'll give them a tremendous thrashing |  depend on it they'll not disappoint us i observed | see  see how the flames are ascending | i have no longer any doubt of what has happened | as we were speaking we were joined by my father and uncle denis whose opinion confirmed our worst fears | the burning of our house was the signal for us to prepare for an immediate attack as the enemy would not take long in traversing the distance between the two places and unless they should take it into their heads to destroy the village they would very soon appear before castle concannan | those of the garrison who had lain down to sleep were aroused and all the men were ordered to their posts | i hurried to mine while my father remained on the roof to give us notice of the approach of the enemy | i opened the port through which my gun was to be fired and looked out | the shades of night were fast floating away and i could see down the slope to a thick wood which covered the opposite side of the valley | my gun was loaded with langrage which was likely to prove far more effective than a single shot for though that could reach to a distance it would not like the pieces of iron scatter death and destruction around | with a slow match in my hand i stood ready for action | a few men only were stationed near me all of whom seemed resolute and determined to fight to the last | i felt very impatient waiting to hear the expected word of command from my father to fire | several times i peeped through the port | at length i saw a body of men emerge from the wood | they halted for a minute or more being apparently the advanced guard till they were joined by others | my father must have seen them but he did not give the order to fire | at length i saw the whole mass advancing and at the same moment my father's voice sounded loud and clear through the building be prepared my men | the enemy are coming but reserve your fire till you receive my orders and then take good aim and don't throw a shot away | my uncle now came over to where i was posted |  the enemy appear to intend attacking us only on this side he observed i hope they may for we shall then be able to sweep them down as they ascend the open slope | they have no scaling ladders with them i am thankful to see or our task would be more difficult | i will lend you a hand barry in fighting your gun till i am called back to my own | we must take care that while we are reloading none of them succeed in creeping through the port they are daring fellows and may make the attempt | we had kept the port closed a man being stationed to lift up the trap the moment the order to fire should be given | for a minute or more perfect silence reigned through the house every one stood eagerly waiting for my father's orders | at length his voice was heard | fire  he shouted and at the same moment as if his command had been addressed to the enemy they began blazing away the shot rattling like hail against the walls | our port being unmasked we ran out the gun depressing it so as to sweep the hill side and fired | loud shrieks and cries arose as the iron shower went crashing among them but as we immediately closed the port we could not see how many fell | still they advanced and as they did so our garrison kept firing away with right good will from every loophole in the house | we meantime reloaded our gun and again ran it out but the enemy scarcely waited for its discharge | its effects were even more deadly than at first for their front ranks were almost up to the walls | before the smoke had cleared away some of them dashed forward towards the port by command of their leader for we heard his voice giving the order but we had our pikes raised to receive them and two if not more were killed as they attempted to force their way in | the others for a moment holding back enabled us to close the port at the same time that some of the men on the roof hurled down on their heads a shower of stones which must have killed or disabled many more | aqualonga for he himself was at the head of the party now found that he had made a mistake in attacking the house on the north side and dashing forward he and his followers took shelter among the out buildings which surrounded the courtyard | he here rallied his men and for a short time the firing ceased for though the out buildings afforded our assailants protection they were unable to fire at us from them | but the fighting was soon renewed | some brands thrown from the top of the walls on to the roof of the out buildings set them on fire and quickly drove out the banditti who now rushed into the courtyard and attempted to burst open the back doors of the house not being aware how strongly they were barricaded | we had on this side also kept a port ready for firing through and my gun being hauled round we sent another dose of langrage among them | numbers fell as did many more from the shot fired at them from the loopholes and the stones hurled down on their heads | still with desperate bravery aqualonga persevered and the bullets came rattling against the walls several making their way through the loopholes and some penetrating the shutters which were of less thickness than those below | at length the enemy brought up a huge log of timber supported on ropes and while the rest of the band fired rapidly at us they attempted to break open one of the lower doors | should this plan succeed they might in spite of all the resistance we could offer force their way in |  they are not aware possibly that we have another gun in reserve observed uncle denis |  we'll bring it round and if they do force the door they'll meet with a reception they little expect | had there been any projections to the house from which we could have opened a flank fire on our assailants we should have had a great advantage but as it was we could only fire directly upon them | the battle now raged with greater fury than before: the banditti seemed determined to get in while we fought for our existence for we knew well that every one of us would be put to death should they succeed | again and again they attacked the port or more properly speaking the embrasure which opened on the courtyard and at last finding that they could not force their way in a number of them brought some heavy masses of timber with which they completely blocked it up so that the gun could not be fired through it | as it was necessary to have a strong party to protect the lower part of the house now attacked several of the garrison were summoned from the upper story when i learned from them that two or three had been killed and five or six wounded who poor fellows were affording ample occupation to doctor stutterheim | should the attack be continued with the same fury as at first the banditti might succeed in spite of the determined resistance we were making | that they still hoped to do so was shown by the way they were attacking the door but as we had two guns ready to receive them besides a number of men with muskets and pikes we did not despair of driving them back even should they break down the barricade | while we were standing ready my uncle recollected that the port on the south side was left unguarded and gerald and tim were sent round to watch it | directly afterwards gerald came running back saying that just before they reached it they saw a couple of black legs going through and on looking out they discovered gab scampering down the hill | they both fired but missed him as he at that instant either intentionally or by chance fell flat on the ground | he quickly picked himself up however and before they could reload he had got under shelter | they had little doubt that his intention was to join aqualonga and lead some of the people through the unguarded port so gerald begged that two or more men might be sent to assist in its defence | this was of course done though they could ill be spared | all this time the battering ram was crashing against the door notwithstanding that several of those working it were one by one picked off by our marksmen in the upper story | in so doing they were exposed to the fire of our assailants at the further end of the courtyard who kept peppering away at us without cessation |  i fear desmond that we shall before long exhaust our powder i heard my eldest uncle observe to my father it is already fearfully diminished |  we shall drive the enemy back before then i hope was the answer it will never do by slackening our fire to let them suppose that we are likely to run short of it | even should it be exhausted we may still hold out and from the rate at which they are firing they are quite as likely to use up all they possess | we were at this time standing ready to discharge our two guns should the door give way and there seemed little hope that it could resist the tremendous battering it was receiving | as soon as one of the men working the battering ram was killed or wounded another took his place | presently there came a loud crash and the shattered door flew in splinters about our ears while through the aperture we saw hundreds of savage countenances with the points of pikes and swords and the muzzles of pistols directed at us | it was but for an instant for directly we could run out our guns we fired them point blank into the living mass | as soon as the smoke cleared away the ground was seen strewed with dead and wounded men while the greater number panic stricken by the unexpected reception we had given them instead of dashing forward to make their way through the opening were rapidly retreating in spite of the efforts of their leader and his officers to stop them |  now my lads | cried my father let's take advantage of their fright and put them to the rout | saying this he dashed through the doorway while i followed with about fifteen more | we drove the enemy before us across the courtyard and should have followed them farther had we not heard my uncle's voice shouting to us to return in tones which showed that he considered we were in the greatest danger | happily we effected our purpose before aqualonga perceived what we were about and as my father and i being the last to re enter the house sprang through the doorway we saw the enemy again advancing | my uncles had during our sortie brought fresh beams with which as soon as we were inside they again barricaded the door | it was not a moment too soon for another band of aqualonga's followers had been perceived approaching the house on the southern side | disappointed in not immediately effecting his object aqualonga now called off his men it was however to reform them and make preparations for a fresh attack | matters with us were now growing more serious: we had only powder to hold out an hour or two longer at the rate at which we had hitherto been using it while the enemy from behind every spot where they could find shelter continued firing at the loopholes | a party of them having gone to a short distance now returned with a quantity of firewood which they threw into all the out buildings nearest the house and setting light to them they were soon blazing furiously | the enemy took care not to give us a moment's respite | although nearly a hundred of them had been killed or badly wounded they still outnumbered us as ten to one | already eight of our men were hors de combat a heavy loss among so small a number yet no one quailed or talked of surrendering | while the flames were raging round us the banditti once more came on to the assault on three sides of the house | we flew to our posts my uncle dragging one of the guns to the south side and i taking mine to the north | the enemy shouted loudly as they advanced | my father and uncles encouraged the men to remain firm and i did my best | hurrah  sure they'll run soon | shouted tim imitating our example | the guns were prepared and waiting till our assailants were close to the walls we discharged them as before | we now saw that they had got fresh battering rams my gun having swept away most of the men carrying that on the north side while the musketry from the loopholes in the upper story played havoc among their ranks | aqualonga appeared everywhere now on one side now on the other in vain we endeavoured to pick him off he seemed to bear a charmed life | we knew him by his spanish uniform but in his appearance there was nothing to show him to be a chief for he was short and broad shouldered with remarkably ugly features | yet the man though serving in a bad cause had the spirit of a hero and his courage animated his followers or they would not have persevered so long | in this attack they kept up as hot a fire as at first when suddenly it ceased | on looking out we saw them retiring rapidly down the hill on both sides and forming out of gun shot on the west | our hopes rose but it would not do to be too sanguine: they might be preparing for a third and more desperate attack | could we resist that attack | we had not more than three or four rounds of ammunition for each musket and not so much should we again have to load the guns | my father animated by the spirit of his youth proposed to charge down the hill and put the enemy to flight he had called some of the men together for that purpose and many were ready to follow him | tim and i of course were eager to do so but my eldest uncle interfered and urged us not to make the attempt: perhaps the enemy had retired with the object in view of drawing us out from our fortifications and then turning round and attacking us with overwhelming numbers |  i believe you are right terence answered my father though i should have liked much to give them a parting salute | the design was accordingly abandoned | our first care was to strengthen the door the enemy had battered in for should they return we must depend rather on our fortifications than on our power of annoying them | to make some amends for our want of ammunition a party of men were told off to carry up a supply of stones and brickbats to the roof to hurl down on our assailants | by using these we might at all events destroy a good many and annoy them while attempting to effect an entrance at any particular part | should they succeed in again breaking open a door we agreed to fight desperately at the breach till not a man of us remained alive | as may be supposed the enemy were anxiously watched from the battlements | to our infinite satisfaction in a few minutes they continued their march and in a short time not a man of them was to be seen | their wounded they carried off but the dead were left where they fell | it was a dreadful sight | upwards of eighty lay stretched on the ground in various attitudes round the house the greater number on the west side in the courtyard | some of these had fallen into the burning buildings and were hideously charred | if left where they were besides the annoyance which the fearful spectacle caused they would render the house uninhabitable | my uncle therefore ordered down ten of the men promising them a reward to bury the bodies and a huge grave being dug in the valley they were dragged down and thrown in | this task occupied nearly the remainder of the day | i had been so much engaged that i had been unable to go up and see my mother and sisters | i now found norah and my mother assisting the doctor in attending to his patients while the rest were in the kitchen superintending the cooking of various viands | i had tasted nothing since the morning and the odour made me excessively hungry | i was thankful therefore when the meal was ready and we all sat down to it with right good appetites | had it not been for our poor fellows killed and wounded we should have been a very merry party | it was my first battle and i could not get over the sight of the unhappy wretches whose bodies i had seen strewing the ground | we were all i trust thankful for our preservation | we did not allow our scarcity of ammunition to be generally known but so small was our supply that unless we had been able to keep out the enemy with our swords and spears we might otherwise by this time have been numbered with the dead | note  a house attacked by aqualonga was defended by a party of the patriots much in the way described in the text | chapter six | the night after the battle on the watch kanimapo appears warns us that aqualonga is about to return we resolve to retreat kanimapo offers to guide us to a place of safety the doctor accompanies the wounded our journey adventures my mother unable to proceed encamp find candela fishing visit the padre in his nest he comes with me to our camp he agrees to accompany us up the mountains again proceed encounter the doctor he joins us kill two pumas and obtain some venison | notwithstanding our success we were perfectly sensible that danger was not over as the enemy might return and in the hope of taking us by surprise renew the attack | of course trustworthy men were placed on the battlements to keep a look out | we were all naturally somewhat tired and were very glad to lie down on mats in the corners of the room | my father and uncles were however too anxious to go to sleep and i desired to be aroused in three hours that i might take my share of watching | when tim called me i got up feeling quite refreshed and at once went to the top of the house to have a look out | the buildings which the enemy had set on fire were still smouldering but i was able to look beyond them into the darkness and to distinguish objects at a considerable distance | the fire which we supposed to be our own house had now gone out showing that it must long since have been burned to the ground | we hoped however that the village had escaped | a passage ran completely round the roof and by its means i could watch each side in succession | i was looking towards the south west where the ground was mostly open when i observed a single figure advancing at a quick pace across it | the person stopped for a few seconds and then came on directly towards the house | whoever he was i could not suppose that he was an enemy | as he got near enough to hear me i hailed and inquired what he wanted |  i come with important information he answered allow me to enter that i may deliver it without delay | from the tone of his voice and the way he pronounced his words i knew that he must be an indian but feeling assured that he was a friend i told him on which side he would find the only door by which he could be admitted then calling to one of the men to take my place i hastened down to the ground floor | i there summoned four trustworthy men to guard the door but on opening it the light from the lantern held by one of the men fell on the stranger's countenance and i recognised kanimapo |  i come he said to urge you to be on your guard for aqualonga has been joined by fresh forces and he has sworn that he will capture the house or perish in the attempt | he fully expects to succeed for a black who states that he made his escape from the house has informed him that many of your people have been killed and wounded and that your ammunition is almost expended | on hearing this aqualonga expressed both rage and regret at not having continued the attack and he fully intends to resume it to morrow night when he hopes to find you off your guard | as i am supposed to be a foe to the patriots i was able to mix among his officers without being suspected and having gained all the necessary information i escaped from the camp and came at once to put you on your guard | i desire also to render you any further assistance in my power | i of course merely give the substance of what kanimapo said | knowing that his information was too important to be neglected for one moment i at once went in search of uncle denis who was on guard | he called up my father uncle terence and doctor stutterheim and kanimapo being summoned a council of war was held | no one having any doubt of the correctness of his information it was quickly decided that in consequence of our want of ammunition it would be hopeless to attempt the defence of the house and that the best prospect we had of saving our lives was to beat a speedy retreat | my uncles proposed proceeding to don fernando's and my father would have gone there also had not kanimapo undertaken to guide him and his family to a place of safety if they would trust to him |  i would invite you all to come but i fear that so large a number would be more likely to be discovered by the spaniards he said | my father expressed his perfect confidence in the indian but said that he must first consult my mother | he therefore went to call her and she and norah quickly appeared | the indian did not conceal his satisfaction when they both declared that they should be ready to trust to his guidance |  kanimapo's life will answer for your preservation he replied |  had he a hundred lives he would willingly give them up for your sakes | it was therefore decided that my uncle and his family with a party of twenty men should immediately start for don fernando's and that we should accompany kanimapo | our chief anxiety was for the poor wounded men | to leave them in the house would be to doom them to certain destruction | it was accordingly arranged that they should be carried to a place of concealment in the neighbourhood of the village where their friends could take care of them |  i will attend them said dr stutterheim although i should have preferred accompanying you my friends into your mountain retreat | but i look upon these poor fellows as my patients and i never desert my patients until they are cured | having once decided to abandon the house the necessary arrangements were rapidly made | litters were formed for carrying the wounded men two horses and a mule were appropriated for the use of my mother and norah and for the conveyance of the younger children | the remainder of the animals were then taken by my uncles as it was important that they should push on rapidly to avoid the danger of being cut off by any of aqualonga's people | my father advised that a party should remain within to barricade the door by which we had made our exit and that they should then descend from the battlements by means of a rope so that it might cost the enemy considerable time and trouble to force their way in | a brief time only was given to parting adieus and then our different parties set out | we had still three hours of darkness before there was any risk of being discovered and after that it will be remembered according to what the indian had heard a whole day would elapse before aqualonga would make his proposed attack | i remained behind a moment to bid farewell to the doctor |  i will not if i can help it quit the neighbourhood till we meet again he said as he wrung my hand |  the banditti will probably not remain here long | when they have retired you may descend from your mountain stronghold and your father will i hope lose no time in rebuilding his house | on consulting with kanimapo as to the best route to take we found that he intended to proceed for some distance along the level ground through the forests and by the shores of the lake then having made a circuit to strike up to the left among the mountains | we should thus avoid the risk of falling into the hands of any scouts sent out by aqualonga and though the route was longer we might easily reach the region to which he wished to conduct us | game he said was abundant and there was a cavern of considerable dimensions which would afford us ample accommodation surrounded by inaccessible rocks the only pathway amid which was little known and might be easily guarded | it may seem strange that my father and tim who had resided so long in the country should not be well acquainted with every part far and wide around but the difficulties and dangers of traversing these mountain districts are so great that few white men are tempted to go out of the beaten track and they are consequently known only to more daring hunters and a few of the indian natives | before we started we sent off the villagers with the wounded men and all our own blacks with the exception of one a faithful fellow named chumbo who had been chiefly instrumental in the capture of the traitor gab and had frequently exhibited great affection for us | we did not even let him know the route we had determined to take and the rest of the party believed that we should at once strike up into the mountains | indeed we proceeded a short distance in that direction and then halted till the rest were out of hearing | my father gerald tim and i carried firearms but our scanty supply of powder would prevent us using them except in cases of emergency | chumbo had a long pike and the usual knife of the country while kanimapo was armed with his bow and spear | we could thus defend ourselves against any wild animals though we might offer but a slight resistance to a body of human foes | silently we moved on through the darkness kanimapo and gerald leading the way and i bringing up the rear while my father and our two attendants walked by the side of our mother and norah with josefa and the children | morning dawned as we were travelling along the side of the lake between which was some forest which would conceal us from the view of any persons on the higher ground | it is often the case that more important events fade from recollection while trifling incidents are remembered so even at the present day the scene on which my eye rested as the sun rose above the horizon is impressed on my memory | we were passing by a small arm or inlet of the lake surrounded thickly by reeds and in parts overhung by the branches of trees amid which birds of gorgeous hue were fluttering while near at hand one of the gaily decked patos reales or royal ducks with its young brood floated on the calmer water and farther off a long legged water fowl of the crane or bittern species stood gazing at us with a watchful eye as we approached its domain | had we possessed a larger supply of ammunition i might have shot the duck for breakfast but i was unwilling to expend a charge of powder and besides i was not sorry to allow the beautiful creature to enjoy its existence | kanimapo came up to us |  we will quickly have some of these birds he observed |  wait a few minutes and you shall see how i will catch them | saying this he retired out of sight of the birds and speedily constructed a sort of basket from the reeds which grew on the bank of sufficient size to cover his head and shoulders | as soon as he had manufactured it he cautiously approached the bank and shoved it off | impelled by a light breeze which blew from the shore it floated away towards where the ducks were swimming about | they swam up to it and after sufficient examination perceiving that it could do them no harm took no further notice of it | the indian in the meantime had formed another basket of the same description which he secured over his shoulders leaving a space sufficient to enable him to look through it | he now slipped into the water and keeping his feet and arms low down slowly swam towards the ducks | they already accustomed to the appearance of the basket seemed in no way alarmed and thus he was able to get close up to them when one after the other disappeared beneath the surface | thus he secured half a dozen fine ducks with which he returned to the shore when he fastened them together with a string and suspended them at his back | we proceeded on some distance farther till we reached a sheltered spot in the woods where we could encamp and cook the provisions we had brought for our morning meal | kanimapo assured us that we need not be afraid of starving as the region to which he proposed to conduct us abounded with game and that should we run short of ammunition his unerring bow would always supply us with an ample amount | as we rested on the ground near the fire the smoke from which assisted to keep away the mosquitoes we talked of the events of the last few days and discussed our prospects for the future | my father was more out of spirits than i had ever seen him the loss of his house and so much of his property was naturally very trying and he had begun to despair of the success of the patriot cause |  shure your honour the more harm the spaniards do to people the more enemies they'll make and for every man they kill a dozen will rise up to revenge his death observed tim |  we don't like them the better for burning our house and if i have the chance i'll show them that some day or other | i felt i must own very much as tim did | i had before been rather cold in the cause though i intended to join general bermudez as soon as summoned but after the accounts i had heard of the atrocities committed by the spaniards and the evidences i had witnessed of what they were capable of doing i felt eager to assist the patriots by every means in my power and regretted the delay which our flight into the mountains must cause | i could not of course quit my mother and brothers and sisters until i had seen them all placed in safety | we feared much that my mother would be unable to stand the rough life we were about to endure | she was indeed already fatigued with her morning ride and when kanimapo proposed that we should proceed my father begged that she might be allowed a longer time to rest | the indian consenting to this he and gerald and i made a short excursion in search of more game | we had not gone far when we reached a stream which ran through the forest thickly bordered by magnificent trees | here animal life abounded parrots flew amid the branches and just above the water a number of small rodents were busily employed in searching for food while a curious boat bill heron which had just scrambled up out of the river was hunting the numerous insects flying about | concealed by the trees we were watching the bird when i saw an opossum rapidly descending the boughs then after hanging for a moment suspended by its prehensile tail it let itself drop directly down upon one of the small rodents which it seized in its claws and was bearing off in triumph when kanimapo shot an arrow and the opossum and its victim fell down a few yards before us | though a carnivorous animal the indian assured us that its flesh was very good eating | on showing the opossum to gerald he said it was called the crab eater | when living near water it exists on crabs and other crustacea but it also feeds on small rodents birds and other creatures | its body was scarcely a foot in length but its tail which was prehensile was fifteen inches long | its fur was darkish and it had a somewhat pointed nose as also a pouch in which to carry its young | i had observed this little creature moving with the activity of a monkey | indeed it was evidently formed for living among trees its powerful tail enabling it to get rapidly and securely from one branch to another | gerald told me that there are various species of opossums one of which lives in the water and has webbed feet but they are mostly found on trees | we carried the opossum back to the camp with three or four parrots which kanimapo had shot | by this time my mother was sufficiently rested to enable us to continue our journey | we pushed forward keeping as much as possible under shelter of the trees not only for the sake of the shade but in order to keep concealed from any parties of the enemy who might be passing in the neighbourhood | we greatly felt the want of people to send out as scouts who might give us due notice should danger be near but we could ill spare any one from our small party | tim and chumbo were required to lead the mules which carried the nurses and the children: josefa sat on one with the baby in her arms and kathleen rode in a huge pannier balancing the younger ones who were placed in another | my father and i guarded them one walking on either side | gerald brought up the rear and kanimapo went ahead to lead the way | at any moment a jaguar might spring out on us so it was necessary to be ever on the watch | we had also to keep a look out for the aques the most savage and deadly snake of that region which without any provocation springs out from its ambush on passers by and will even follow them and giving a tremendous leap fix its fangs in a person's body | the rattlesnake is not nearly so dangerous as its rattle always gives notice of its approach while the boa and anaconda can from their size generally be seen moving through the grass and avoided | there are of course many other venomous serpents in the country | they seldom attack people however unless trodden on but numerous as are the serpents of south america they generally keep away from the haunts of men | we had proceeded as far as i could judge about half way between padre pacheco's house and our own when kanimapo pointing to a range of mountains in the west told us that we must now turn in that direction | we accordingly followed him hoping to get some way up the mountains before nightfall | we had gone some distance farther when my father observed my mother looking very ill and she confessed that she was suffering greatly from the heat and feared that she should not be able much longer to sit her horse | on this he called a halt and we looked about for some place where we might bivouac | we fixed on a small open space entirely surrounded by shrubs thickly entwined with creepers which would afford us shelter and concealment | on one side ran a stream bordered by reeds and apparently not very deep | we at once set to work to cut down boughs to form a hut for my mother and sister | we bound the tops of the branches together with sepos and then thatched it with large palm leaves which would effectually keep out the rain should any fall | working with a will the operation did not take us as long as might be supposed and a very complete hut was constructed with walls which no jaguar or puma could break through or any ordinary sized snake or other animal penetrate | the only creatures it could not keep out were the mosquitoes but as my mother had thoughtfully brought some mosquito curtains we were able to set those tormenting creatures at defiance | the hut was finished and chumbo was at a little distance cutting firewood when we heard him shriek out a snake | a snake | i am bitten | kanimapo instantly ran towards him |  let me see the wound he said | chumbo showed where the snake had bitten his leg when kanimapo produced a small bottle from his waist belt and poured a few drops from it into the wound | he then desired chumbo to swallow a little of the decoction which he gave him |  you will suffer no harm from the bite he added and if you see another snake cut off its head and bring it to me | chumbo on hearing this soon recovered his calmness and in a short time returned to the camp with a large bundle of wood | not having much confidence in the antidote we expected to hear him soon begin to complain of the sensations which generally result from a snake bite | i asked kanimapo what he had given chumbo | he said it was the juice of a red berry boiled into a syrup and it was considered so efficacious that all indians carried a bottle of it about with them | he told me that it had been discovered by an indian who was one day in the forest and saw a desperate combat take place between a small bird called the snake hawk and a snake | during the conflict the snake frequently bit the bird which on each occasion flew off to a tree called the guacco and devoured some of its red berries then after a short interval it renewed the fight with its enemy and in the end succeeded in killing the snake which it ate | thinking the matter over the indian arrived at the belief that these berries would cure any human being bitten by the snake | he accordingly made a decoction and not long after had an opportunity of trying it upon himself | it proved effectual so instead of keeping it secret as some people might have done he generously made it known to all his acquaintance and thus the use of this berry became universal | in the case of chumbo however i was not satisfied that the antidote had been really required for he confessed to me that he believed he had been bitten by a coral snake which he declared was most venomous whereas i have since learned that it is perfectly harmless | but i believe that no specific has yet been discovered to prevent the fatal effects of bites by the more venomous snakes | the occurrence made us feel a little uncomfortable when we lay down at night for we could not help fancying that snakes might crawl into our camp and attack us while sleeping | at kanimapo's suggestion he and gerald and i set off to explore the country over which we should have to pass the next day that we might ascertain whether there were any foes lurking in the neighbourhood though as no high road if i may so call the tracks which led from one place to another passed within some leagues of it we were not likely to meet with any spaniards | gerald and i took our guns while our indian friend carried his bow and arrows that he might shoot any game he came across | i kept along the bank of the river while my companions took a course more to the left | soon i had lost sight of gerald and the indian and was attempting to go on farther than i had intended when the sun disappeared behind the mountains and suddenly left me in darkness | i turned to retrace my steps with somewhat uncomfortable feelings lest a jaguar or puma might be following me | i do not mind mentioning these creatures so often for i defy any one to wander alone through the south american forests without thinking of their possible vicinity and the numberless stories he may have heard from the natives of the way in which people have been destroyed by these savage beasts | the puma it is true is not so fierce as the jaguar but at the same time it is very dangerous as it will cat like follow a person and spring upon him if it can catch him unawares | it will not in most instances attack him if he faces it boldly but will then slink off whereas the jaguar will attack a man unless he has the nerve to fix his eye on the brute when it generally hesitates to spring forward but it will do so the instant he turns and should he attempt to fly will bound after him and bring him to the ground | i had not gone many paces intending to keep along the bank of the stream that i might the more easily find my way when the moon rose round and full shedding her silvery light over the scene on the quivering leaves and the waters of the stream rippled by a gentle breeze | i kept my eyes round me on every side with my lingers on the trigger of my gun occasionally giving a glance over my shoulder to ascertain whether any animal was following me when i caught sight of a dark figure kneeling close to the edge of the water with a long rod in his hand | i saw that he was fishing though it did seem an odd time for a person to be so employed | for a moment i thought it must be chumbo but then i recollected the distance i was from the camp and that my father would not have allowed him to quit it for such a purpose as we had as much food as we required | i had no cause to be afraid of the man whoever he might be but i advanced cautiously so as not to alarm him | as i got nearer the light of the moon fell on his face and i discovered to my great satisfaction that he was no other than padre pacheco's black servant candela so i immediately surmised that his master could not be far off |  candela my friend what has brought you here | i cried out as i advanced from amid the shrubs which concealed me |  o senor barry is that you | praise heaven | he exclaimed pulling out a fish which with his rod he threw on the bank and then rushed forward to greet me | his delight was very great on being assured that he was not mistaken and he at once told me that his master was hiding in the neighbourhood being afraid as yet to return to his home |  we first took to the mountains he said but the padre found scrambling among the rocky heights did not suit him | besides which we had no firearms to shoot game and i am no great hand with the bow and arrow so that we were almost starving | it was very tantalising to see plenty of deer and pacas and birds and not be able to get them and at last the padre resolved to risk coming down here where i knew that i could support him and myself by fishing having fortunately some fish hooks in my pocket when we took to flight | poor man | you wouldn't know him he has grown so thin though he has retained his health |  if you will lead me to him i will try to persuade him to accompany us i said |  my father will i am sure be glad of his society and i then gave candela a brief account of what had happened and where we proposed going | candela hesitated a moment |  the senor padre told me on no account to let his retreat be discovered he said but he has confidence in you and you may follow me | stop when i tell you and i will go forward and ask his leave to bring you to him | candela then secured his fish and hiding his rod in the bushes led the way into the thick forest crawling on his hands and knees under the mass of creepers and branches while i did the same | at length he stopped at a spot under some lofty trees through which the beams of the moon could scarcely penetrate |  stay here senor barry he whispered and i will go forward and prepare the senor padre for your coming | in less than a minute i heard the padre's voice exclaiming yes yes i will see him gladly | i long to give him an abrazo | though thus sure of a welcome i did not attempt to advance as i literally could not see in what direction to move without the risk of running against the trunk of a tree or stumbling over the roots | presently i heard candela speaking close beside me |  take my hand senor barry he said and we will soon reach our abode | stoop down again and creep after me till i tell you to stand up | in a little he spoke again |  take hold of this ladder | my master and i have imitated the birds and formed a nest for ourselves up in a tree no jaguars snakes or peccaries can reach us there and the gothos are not likely to search in such a spot | as he spoke i put my foot on the first round of a ladder and commenced the ascent and soon i saw a light streaming through a sort of trap down which the padre's smiling countenance was beaming on me | a few rounds more carried me into the interior of a small hut built among the branches on a substantial platform | the padre gave me the promised embrace and then bade me sit down on the floor as he had no other seat to offer | candela immediately joined us and drawing up the ladder which was formed of the strong creeper i have already described closed the trap |  you see senor barry thanks to the skill of my faithful attendant i am as snug here as i can desire and may set my enemies at defiance remarked the padre for even were they to come to the very foot of the tree they would scarcely discover my abode as you will be able to judge when you see it by daylight for we have taken good care to conceal the lower part of the platform with boughs while the surrounding foliage completely hides the nest itself | of course the padre wished to know how it was i had found candela so i gave him a full account of all that had happened |  could you not remain with me | he asked |  we might construct two or three nests like this in which you could all stow away and we might shout to each other from our respective abodes like the howling monkeys and the padre chuckled at his joke | i told him that i doubted whether my father would agree to his proposal for several reasons | the forest region was not considered healthy though he had not suffered from living in it and we had horses and mules which as we could not haul them up into the branches would probably betray us | i added that as i was sure my father would be glad of his society i hoped that he would rather accompany us up the mountains and as we were promised an abundance of game by our indian guide he would thus no longer suffer from hunger as before while the region was much more healthy and nearly as inaccessible as his present residence |  i agree with you in regard to your first reasons senor barry he answered but i very much doubt whether unless i were betrayed my enemies can possibly find me where i am | he acknowledged that the want of food was the greatest drawback to his life in the forest as he had only fish to depend on and even to obtain that candela had to run the risk of discovery | he took the precaution however when he went out to wear scarcely any clothing so that should he be seen he might not be known as the padre's servant |  i am glad to see you as i shall be to see your good father continued the padre |  i confess though that i am somewhat surprised to find that you are still with him | it is however very right and proper that you should be so | i had expected that you would by this time have joined the band of general bermudez who must i should fancy have commenced operations against the foe but you are undoubtedly where you should be with your father | i replied that i had been waiting for a summons from the general and should have been prepared to join his standard had he sent for me | though i should have been glad to have remained with the padre i told him that i was afraid my father would become anxious did i not appear at the camp with my brother and the indian and that i must now hasten back by myself unless he would accompany me | i thought he could do so without danger and my father and mother would be delighted to see him | he thought a moment |  i will go with you he said |  candela we will visit the senor desmond and you will easily find the way back though by my faith it is more i suspect than i could do myself | candela had no objection to offer | indeed there was no danger of the padre being discovered as our enemies were not likely to be wandering in that part of the forest at night and even if they were unless they found out our camp we might easily conceal ourselves from them | this being arranged candela after listening at the trap to make sure that no one by any chance was near led the way down the ladder | i followed as soon as he was at the bottom and the padre came last candela and i holding the lower end of the ladder to steady it | the padre however exhibited far more activity than i had expected and came down as fast as i had done | he had laid aside i should have said his usual clerical attire and was habited in a half military dress with a broad brimmed straw hat on his head and having allowed his beard and moustache to grow i should not with his hat on have recognised him | he carried a long stout stick which dexterously wielded was calculated to prove a formidable weapon |  i should not venture to leave the ladder hanging down in the daytime though there is little chance even then of any one reaching the spot he observed | candela now led the way crying out to us when to stoop down and when to crawl as we passed through the narrow passages by which he had before conducted me | the padre followed and i kept close after him | thus we progressed till we reached the more open part of the forest near the edge of the river | candela now pushed on at a rapid rate till we saw the light of our camp fire a short distance off | i then proposed going ahead to announce the padre's coming | i found my father watching at the entrance of the opening gerald and the indian had arrived and he was beginning to get anxious at my non appearance | he was very glad to hear that padre pacheco was alive and well and was coming to the camp so i hastened back to meet him and candela | while we were greeting the padre his servant received an equally warm welcome from tim and chumbo | my father endeavoured to persuade the padre to accompany us up the mountains |  i would rather advise you to remain here answered the padre |  you would run no risk of being discovered while living as i do at the top of a tree and you may kill as much game as you require |  we should kill no game while living at the top of a tree that is very certain answered my father and the report of our guns when shooting in the forest would be more than likely to reach the ears of our enemies | at last the padre with a sigh agreed that my father's plan was the best |  as for accompanying you he said i cannot make up my mind | if i could discover where the brave bermudez or paez or bolivar himself are i would join their forces and i might do good service by preaching to the men and encouraging them to perform their duty |  you are more likely to hear of them by accompanying us to the mountains than by remaining where you are said my father |  our indian guide will be able to gain information and should any of the patriot bands come into the neighbourhood you will have the opportunity of joining them | i will introduce our friend kanimapo to you and you can consult him | the indian who was seated at a little distance near another fire with tim chumbo and candela was accordingly summoned | the padre examined his countenance attentively |  we have met before my friend he said |  i do not know you answered the indian you must be mistaken |  mistaken i am not said the padre but you probably do not recognise me in my present dress | once you came to the house of padre pacheco and wished to be instructed in the christian religion | you remember that |  i do said the indian |  and i went away as wise as i came or rather from what you told me i was convinced that it was a religion that would not suit me | the padre sighed |  i am afraid that i gave you a wrong notion of it he answered and that it was my fault that you did not accept it | but i have since read the book god has given to man to make known his will and i should tell you very differently now |  i shall be very glad to hear you said the indian for i much wish to understand the white man's religion | i cannot believe that more than one god exists and he must be powerful and good or he could not have made this world as it appears to us or given abundance of food to man as he has done | how to ask him for what we want and how to merit his favour is what i desire to know |  i cannot tell you all that now said the padre but i will as far as i know it by and by | in the meantime senor desmond wishes to consult you on a matter of importance | my father then asked kanimapo if he would assist the padre should he determine to join any of the patriot bands | the indian asked time to consider the subject and while we talked on among ourselves he retired to a short distance | he soon returned and expressed his readiness to act as the padre might wish | the arrangement was finally concluded and our friend promised to join us in the morning | at all events in his present costume there was little danger of his being recognised and he would run no more risk than would any of us | he preferred returning to his nest for the night especially as he had left a book and a few other articles there | that book he told us was the bible which had of late become his constant study | the evening's rest had greatly restored my mother and we hoped to be able to start early the next morning | a watch was set as usual and two large fires were kept up which would scare any wild beasts though they might not prove any impediment to the approach of snakes | still the flames would enable the person on guard to see them and we had three or four long sticks cut ready to attack them should any be discovered | the night passed away quietly and the moment day broke all hands were called up and we breakfasted on the remains of the wild ducks and opossum | as soon as breakfast was over the fires were extinguished and the embers scattered so that no one coming that way might ascertain how lately we had left the spot | my mother and sister having mounted their horses and the nurses and children being placed on their mules we moved forward looking out as we went along for the padre and his servant | we had not gone far when a voice hailed us from behind some thick shrubs and presently our friend appeared so completely disguised that had i not examined his features i should not have recognised him | his hat was stuck jauntily on one side sufficiently low down to conceal his shorn crown and a gaily coloured handkerchief which a west indian negro would have envied was tied in a bow round his throat | his coat was braided and slashed his breeches were ornamented with tags and laces and open at the knees showing his stout calves encased in leathern leggings while in a sash round his waist was stuck a long dagger and a brace of pistols | candela followed carrying a biggish bundle hung to the end of a pole which he balanced on his shoulder with a long stick in his hand and a machete secured in his waist belt | after greeting us the padre whispered to me i am not so warlike as i look for my pistols are unloaded since i have neither powder nor shot and one of them is destitute of a lock | my dagger however is sharp and i can use my stick to some purpose | i told him that we could supply him with a rifle and spare him some ammunition for his serviceable pistol should there be any probability of our being compelled to fight |  depend on me i will not hang back if we have to defend ourselves he answered |  i have no love for lighting but in this case it is lawful and right of that i am assured | the padre walked along far more actively than i had expected and we were glad to have our party strengthened by such sturdy allies as he and his man candela | the forest through which we were proceeding extended some way up the side of the mountains with only two or three paths running across it at right angles to our course | as these were in some sense highways and people might be traversing them perhaps enemies we passed by them as rapidly as possible so that we might avoid the risk of encountering any one | as kanimapo knew when we were approaching one of these paths he went some way ahead and looked up and down to ascertain whether any one was travelling along it | we had halted for this purpose when he came back and said that he had seen a person on a mule coming from the south and urging his beast on at a rapid rate | he advised us to remain concealed till the traveller had passed not that being alone he could do us any harm but he might betray us to our enemies | being near the path i was tempted to creep forward to see who the stranger was | i had moved a few paces when i heard a bark and presently a dog came rushing towards me barking furiously and apparently with the intention of flying at my throat | i might easily have shot the animal and i was lifting my weapon in case it should be necessary to fire when i recognised my old acquaintance jumbo | jumbo jumbo  i shouted out don't you remember your friends | jumbo knew my voice instantly: he ceased barking and came fawning up to me | i was sure that his master could not be far off and hurrying out from my concealment i saw before me dr stutterheim who supposing that his dog had discovered a jaguar had unslung his gun ready to do battle with the wild beast | great was the pleasure he exhibited at seeing me |  why barry | my dear barry | he exclaimed what wonderful chance has enabled us thus to meet | i thought that you were long ago safe among the mountains and despairing of finding you i was on my way down to any port i could reach on the coast from whence i could escape from this unhappy country regretting that i should probably see you no more and almost as much grieved i must confess the fact to leave all my treasures behind me to rot or be eaten by the ants as i had no means of transporting them |  i thought doctor that you were determined to remain with your patients till they recovered i remarked |  alack alack | my friend they have gone where they require no surgeon's aid replied the doctor |  those bloodthirsty spaniards last night burst into the village and murdered every wounded man together with several other people men women and children whom they caught | i myself narrowly escaped with my life by remaining concealed in the garden of the house under a bed of pumpkins where it did not occur to them to look for me | finding that they had beaten a retreat being alarmed by a report that a large body of patriots was near at hand i crept out of my place of concealment and fortunately stumbled upon this mule saddled and bridled on which i rode away as fast as i could make the brute move over the rough paths | the indian who had witnessed my meeting with the doctor and saw that he was a friend had gone off to report the same to my father who now appeared with the rest of our party |  the cruel monsters | exclaimed the padre when he heard the account given by the doctor surely such barbarities must call down the vengeance of heaven on the heads of those bloodthirsty tyrants and their supporters | even had i not ample reason for siding with the patriots the account you have given us would make me desirous of exerting all my energies to promote the overthrow of those monsters | they must be driven from the land before we can hope for peace and prosperity and i for one will not don cassock again till i have aided in accomplishing the work |  bravo senor padre for padre i suppose you are said the doctor |  i highly approve of your patriotic principles and resolutions and should a sacrilegious bullet enter your body i promise you that i will do my best to extract it and set you on your legs again should i happily be near you | the padre thanked the doctor but quickly changed the subject his feelings had run away with him and perhaps he did not quite like to contemplate the contingency to which the doctor alluded | the doctor did not require much persuasion to be induced to accompany us | he might render us some service he observed and might find ample objects of interest in the alpine region into which we were proceeding | he had fortunately brought a rifle and a good supply of ammunition which was especially welcome | as soon as the doctor had resolved to join us we lost no time in moving forward lest some other traveller might come that way and discover us | after a time we found that we were gradually ascending though we had mounted to a considerable distance before we perceived any change in the size of the trees or alteration in their character for palms and other tropical plants still flourished and the heat was as great as in the plains below | at length however we reached the bare side of the mountain the vast precipitous rocks towering up above us while the vegetation was that of more temperate climes | looking back at the forest from which we had emerged i was struck by its magnificent appearance illumined as it was by the almost perpendicular rays of the sun which caused the broad leaves of the trees to shine with dazzling brilliancy | we could hear when we stopped the roaring of the cascade though concealed by rocks and groves of the indian fig tree | up and up we went sometimes along narrow paths on the summit of precipices with barely sufficient room for a single animal to advance without risk of slipping over | the mules were so sure footed that we had but little anxiety about them but the danger my mother and sister ran on horseback was very great | no one could render them any help and they had to depend upon their nerve and the steadiness of their horses | frequently i held my breath as i saw the places they had to pass | at length from the height over which we were crossing we looked down upon a broad valley |  i told you that i would bring you to a region where there is an abundance of game observed kanimapo and he pointed to a herd of deer directly below us grazing quietly unconscious of our vicinity |  but see | there are already hunters before us i remarked as at that instant i observed two large pumas stealing along the top of an overhanging rock | so eager were they in pursuit of their object they did not discover us | scarcely had i spoken when the first threw itself off and pounced directly down on the back of an unsuspecting deer its companion the next instant following its example | so sure was their spring both secured their victims and began tearing off the still quivering flesh with mouth and claws while the rest of the herd seeing the fate of their companions fled like the wind along the valley |  they cannot go far observed kanimapo and we shall always find some in this neighbourhood when we want them |  we must not let these savage brutes enjoy their meal at leisure said the doctor dismounting and getting his rifle ready to fire |  you take the one on the right barry and i will shoot the other | we must have their skins and the venison will not be much the worse for the way it has been killed | we both fired and the pumas rolled over struggling in the agonies of death |  we must now secure the venison cried the doctor leading the way down the precipitous side of the valley | tim and i followed him candela soon afterwards joining us and we were quickly engaged in the not over pleasant operation of cutting up the deer and skinning the pumas | as soon as we had secured the skins of the wild beasts and the best joints from the deer we loaded the doctor's mule with them as he volunteered to give it up for the purpose and to proceed with us on foot | though game was abundant our guide did not consider it safe for us to remain in the valley | we had still some hours of daylight and before we could hope to rest in safety we had he told us many mountain heights and deep valleys to traverse | chapter seven | paramos described suffer from want of water reach a stream encamp indian legends a capybara enemies in the neighbourhood ascend a steep mountain descend and reach a beautiful valley take up our abode in a magnificent cavern explore the cavern strange birds kanimapo shows us another cavern constructs a rope bridge hazardous passage kill a jaguar and capture two deer tim and chumbo appear chumbo's adventure with king vultures norah and kathleen in danger from a jaguar saved by kanimapo good news preparations for our departure | the fresh air of that elevated region a contrast to the heavy damp atmosphere of the plain below so revived our spirits and strengthened our muscles that all were eager to push on | we were it must be remembered travelling over a series of mountain heights forming a chain considerably to the eastward of the true cordilleras which are of much greater elevation but even here the cold on the more lofty mountains is excessive as it is in some of the valleys between them | these valleys are uninhabitable deserts known as paramos in which no human being can exist without keeping in unceasing and violent motion | no artificial means appears sufficient to sustain life while a person is exposed to their chilling atmosphere the strongest spirits have no effect and indeed increase the direful consequences | they are usually long deep valleys so shut in by neighbouring heights that scarcely a single ray of the sun sheds its genial influence through them | if a person attempts to remain in them unsheltered at night death will certainly overtake him | some of them however are so extensive that it requires two or three days to cross them | to enable this to be done small houses have been erected at certain distances in which cooking utensils wood for firing and other articles of convenience are kept for the accommodation of travellers as well as stabling for their mules | but to remain in a paramo during the night even though thus protected is often a painful ordeal | only for two or three months of the year november december and january are they inhabitable by human beings and it is during those months alone that the huts can be erected or the fuel stored for the remainder of the year | the doctor described to me the way in which people suffer: the highly rarified air at first occasions great difficulty in breathing with a sharp piercing pain at each inspiration in a short time the person becomes benumbed in the extremities owing to his incapacity for continuing in motion | he is next seized with violent delirium and in his horrible paroxysms froths at the mouth tears the flesh from his hands and arms pulls his hair and beats himself violently against the ground meanwhile uttering the most piercing cries till completely exhausted he remains without motion or feeling and death ensues | the only effectual remedy when a person is thus seized is to beat him violently and to make him drink cold water from the springs found in all parts of the paramo but this remedy must be employed immediately after the first symptoms appear | art becomes so specialized as to be comprehensible only to artists and they complain bitterly of public indifference to their work | for since the artist in such times has no need to say much but only to be notorious for some small originality and consequently lauded by a small group of patrons and connoisseurs which incidentally is also a very profitable business for him there arise a crowd of gifted and skilful painters so easy does the conquest of art appear | in each artistic circle are thousands of such artists of whom the majority seek only for some new technical manner and who produce millions of works of art without enthusiasm with cold hearts and souls asleep | competition arises | the wild battle for success becomes more and more material | most of us therefore were beginning to suffer greatly from thirst the padre and the doctor had not drunk anything since the previous evening and would have given a good deal for a cup of fresh water | the sides of the plateau were so steep that we could not descend in any part though occasionally we heard through the trees the sound of rushing water rising from the depths below or coming down from the mountain on the opposite side | the horses and mules too were beginning to exhibit every sign of thirst the mules sometimes showing an inclination to bolt off either on one side or the other as though they thought they could make their way down to the spots from whence the tantalising sound arose | our guide cheered us on |  we shall reach a valley before sunset and i have no fear but we shall there find water enough to quench the thirst of us all he observed | all this time my mother and norah exhibited wonderful powers of endurance and never complained of the steepness or dangerous nature of the road nor did they now of the thirst from which they in common with us all were suffering | i was surprised that our guide had not warned us but accustomed as he was to go for hours together without eating or drinking it had not occurred to him that we should suffer any inconvenience | at length we came to the end of the ridge | as we began to descend by one of the most rugged of paths the sound of a waterfall reached our ears and in the course of a few minutes on going to the edge of a rock we caught sight of a magnificent cascade issuing from the mountain side and dashing down into a large basin in the valley below | hoch hurrah  there's the water and i hope before long to have a gallon down my throat cried the doctor and unable longer to restrain himself he set off to run down the steep descent | the padre excited by the same feeling rushed after him while i followed in a somewhat more cautious way not without considerable fear that my friends in their eagerness might tumble over the precipice before they reached the bottom | my father and the rest of the men held back the horses and mules to prevent them following the doctor's example and maybe sending their riders over their heads | happily no harm occurred and we all reached the side of a sparkling stream of considerable volume which went bounding and foaming away amid the hills ultimately taking an easterly course and falling into the plain we had left | a hollow in the side of the hill only a little above the water afforded us ample camping ground and from the numerous luxuriant shrubs which grew around we were able to build some comfortable huts as well as to cut a sufficient supply of firewood |  you may remain here without much fear of interruption my friends observed kanimapo |  but at the same time the spot could easily be reached by those in search of you so i wish to conduct you to a place in which no enemy can find you | my father at once agreed to this indeed the valley though it had its attractions was not the place we should have wished to live in for any length of time | unless actually tracked we were not likely to be discovered as the opposite heights were inaccessible and we were completely hidden owing to the form of the rocks and the overhanging trees from any one passing on the hills above us | we thus considered that we need not apprehend danger during the few hours it was necessary to remain encamped on the spot | there was an abundance of grass too for our horses and mules and the venison we had brought with us was provision sufficient for a couple of days at least | i have so often described our night encampments that i need not mention the arrangements we made on the present occasion | i was much struck by the romantic beauty of the scene: the cascade in the distance the rapid stream rushing and foaming below us the lofty mountains rising in front and the rich vegetation which clothed the cliffs behind the huts nestling under the trees the blazing fire surrounded by our party the animals grazing on the green turf which carpeted the ground | there was sufficient danger to create some excitement and yet not enough to prevent us from enjoying our supper and entering into an animated conversation | the padre and the doctor chiefly engaged in it and afforded us much amusement kanimapo also occasionally took a part | we were speaking of the monkeys of the country some of which possess wonderful intelligence and the padre described one which had learned to sit at table and use a knife and fork and would drink wine out of a cup and bow to the company |  have you ever heard of the salvaje or wild man of the woods who builds a house for himself and sometimes carries off people to dwell with him when he wants companionship and occasionally eats them if he is hungry | said the padre |  has anybody seen him | asked the doctor for until i see him i shall refuse to believe in his existence |  i cannot say that i ever saw him answered the padre but i have known people who have found the traces of his feet the toes of which are turned backwards and others have caught sight of him peeping from among the boughs of a tree |  who can doubt about him | exclaimed the indian who had hitherto remained silent |  my people and those who dwell on the upper waters of the orinoco to the ocean on the north know very well all about him | some call him the achi others the vasatri or great devil and he is exactly like a big man only covered with dark hair | the doctor burst into a fit of laughter |  if you caught him you would find your man of the woods turn out to be a huge bear whose feet somewhat resemble those of a man | i have never heard of a large monkey in this country though of course such may exist in regions unexplored |  i am afraid doctor you are very sceptical observed the padre | sometimes probably the object is the one most important for the welfare of the community sometimes it may have come from accident | see below 554 ff |  817 the artificial objects that are regarded in a few cases as totems are probably of late origin the product of reflection and thus differing from the old totems which arise in an unreflective time | however the artificial totems are doubtless sometimes looked on as powerful in some cases they may be little more than badges |  once upon a time the sea flowed over the whole of the plain and all the people perished with the exception of a man and woman who floated about in a boat and at last arrived safely on a high mountain called tamanaca | some of you may have seen on the lofty cliffs which rise above the orinoco and other rivers curious figures sculptured on their faces at a height which no human being could now reach | how could they have been carved unless the waters had risen up to them and thus enabled our fathers to reach them in boats |  the belief you entertain my friend exists in all parts of the world observed the doctor and i doubt not that it has its origin in truth | the indian looked satisfied and then went on to tell us of the wars which his people waged in former days when they lived near the ocean with the white men who first came over to their country | the most ferocious and daring of these indeed he appears to have been almost a madman was lopez de aguirri | descending the amazon from peru he made his way along the coast across the mouth of the orinoco and through the gulf of paria till he entered the caribbean sea and ultimately reached the island of margarita | from thence he returned to the continent and established himself in the city of valencia where he proclaimed the independence of the country and the deposition of philip the second | the native inhabitants made their escape across the lake of tacarigua taking with them all their boats so that aguirri could only exercise his cruelties on his own people | he at once began to put to death those who opposed him and in a letter to the king he boasts of the number of officers whom he had killed | afterwards having got himself named king he appointed captains and sergeants but these wishing to put him out of the way they were all afterwards hanged by his orders | aguirri or as he is still called by the common people the tyrant was at length abandoned by his own men and put to death | when surrounded by foes and conscious that his fate was inevitable he plunged a dagger into the bosom of his only daughter that she might not have to blush before the spaniards at the term the daughter of a traitor | the natives still believe that the soul of the tyrant wanders in the savannahs like a flame which flies on the approach of men | i wish that i could recollect more of the stories narrated on that evening | we were interrupted by a rushing sound as if some animal were breaking through the bushes | the doctor started up exclaiming an anaconda a boa | be prepared my friends and boldly advanced in the direction of the sound | my father gerald and i seizing our rifles followed his example | the padre did not exhibit the same eagerness but kept his seat and begged my mother and norah not to be alarmed as he very much doubted that any large serpent could have made its way so far up the mountains and even if it should prove to be a puma or jaguar we were likely he said to give a good account of it | having quieted their fears he got up and taking tim's rifle joined us | jumbo had been in a state of excitement when he saw what we were about and losing patience boldly dashed into the wood | presently out there came what at the first glance i took to be a wild boar but as it passed before us towards the water i saw that it was an animal of a very different species | the doctor fired and brought it to the ground when jumbo rushing forward seized it by the throat | the creature made little or no resistance and having dragged it up to the fire we saw that it was a capybara or water hog | the doctor remarked that it was the largest of all living rodents being upwards of three feet in length and enormously fat | it had a blunt muzzle with the eyes set high in the head was destitute of a tail and its toes were so united as to enable it to swim with ease | it was of a blackish grey hue with rather long hairs of a yellow tinge falling thickly over the body | the doctor exhibited its head which contained enormous incisor teeth and curiously formed molars | he remarked that its webbed feet enable it to swim rapidly and that when pursued it dives and can remain nearly eight minutes under water so that if not taken unawares it is able to escape most of its numerous foes | among the most deadly of these is the jaguar which preys largely on the poor tailless animal but man is also its enemy for its flesh is excellent and is considered like that of the hog | as it was important to secure a good supply of food the capybara was forthwith cut up and some of its flesh roasted |  i trust that it will not cost us dear observed kanimapo as we returned to our seats |  i should have warned you not to fire unless in a case of great necessity for should any one be wandering near at hand it might lead them to our retreat | soon after this he left us without saying a word | my mother and sister and the children then retired to their bowers but the rest of the party still sat talking by the fire | some time had elapsed when kanimapo rejoined us |  we must be very cautious he observed |  there are strangers in the neighbourhood though whether friends or foes i cannot say but we must take care not to create a bright blaze lest the reflection on the opposite cliff should betray us | they are not likely to remain where they are and will probably move on to a more sheltered spot for the night | what has brought them here i cannot tell but i suspect that they are fugitives from one party or the other | at all events it will not be safe for us to proceed till they have left the neighbourhood | this information made us feel rather anxious especially when the padre suggested that the strangers might find their way down to our encampment |  there is no fear of that as they have already passed the only point where they could descend the cliffs answered the indian |  all we have to do is to remain quiet | we agreed not to tell my mother and sister what we had heard but to keep a vigilant watch so that should the strangers prove to be foes and find us out we might be prepared to resist them | the thoughts of a possible encounter kept us awake during the greater part of the night and towards morning the ever active kanimapo again stole out of the camp | just before daybreak he returned | he had got sufficiently near to the strangers' camp to hear what they were talking about and he had discovered that they were mostly deserters from the spanish army who had turned robbers and were as ready to prey on one party as the other | it would therefore be very dangerous to fall into their hands and kanimapo advised that we should remain concealed where we were till they had left the neighbourhood | the time as may be supposed was an anxious one: still it afforded us rest and as we had plenty of food we were gaining strength to enable us to perform the more arduous part of the journey which still lay before us | kanimapo was absent till the evening tracking the banditti | he at length saw them cross a lofty ridge to the southward and disappear and feeling satisfied that they would no longer molest us he returned with the intelligence | the following morning we were again en route | having reached the foot of a steep mountain our guide called a halt and told us that we were near the end of our journey but that there were portions of the path which no mules or horses could traverse | we could however reach our destination by taking a much more circuitous path | he inquired whether we should be content to proceed on foot in which case we might reach a place of safety in the course of three or four hours or if we were disposed to take the circuitous path which would occupy the whole of that day and a portion of the next while we would also run the risk of discovery as the high road passed in view of the track we should have to pursue | my father at once decided to ascend the mountain on foot while tim volunteered with chumbo to conduct the horses and mules round by the way kanimapo described to him | led by the indian we therefore recommenced the ascent of the mountain without delay | fatiguing as it was the doctor and the padre each insisted on carrying a child while my father helped up my mother and i aided norah though kathleen and she declared they felt perfectly able to climb up by themselves | gerald and i sometimes gave them our hands at others pushed them from behind | after ascending a considerable distance we saw on our right a lofty peak | the clearness of the atmosphere made it appear much nearer than it really was | kathleen announced her intention of climbing to the top of it and was much surprised to find that it was some twenty or thirty miles off | in spite of the fresh air the heat was great but the atmosphere was far more exhilarating than i had before found it in the plains | at last the summit was reached when we went some distance over tolerably level ground and then had to commence descending by one of the steepest paths i ever met with such as even the mules could not have slidden down without the risk of rolling over | on reaching the bottom we found a rapid stream flowing at our feet along the brink of which kanimapo now led us and we continued making our way amid the rich vegetation which grew on either side till we saw before us a fine waterfall and as far as we could judge our progress appeared completely barred | kanimapo did not hesitate |  come on my friends we are near our resting place at last he said and turning to the right he led the way through a thick belt of trees which lined the stream and began to ascend an almost perpendicular cliff | the roots and branches of the trees which grew out of it however formed a sort of natural ladder or series of steps up which even my mother found no great difficulty in climbing and we soon found ourselves on level ground a small placid lake out of which the rocks on the opposite side rose abruptly appearing among the trees | by continuing along the shores of this lake we reached another waterfall of considerable width and depth and overhung with magnificent trees which added greatly to its picturesque beauty | we now made another ascent very similar to the first till we reached a higher level of the same stream | i expected that we were going to continue along it but instead of doing so kanimapo led us by a zigzag path till we gained a broad terrace from whence we could look down into the valley and over the summits of numerous heights beyond | still the air though pure and bracing from its dryness caused no sensation of cold | high as we were too there were several mountains in sight which were still higher | we had proceeded along the terrace one mountain rose directly in front of us with a perpendicular face of great height | the rush of water sounded in our ears and as we advanced we caught sight of the stream flowing across the platform and proceeding out of the very side of the mountain as it seemed to us | advancing for a few hundred yards | more we discovered that it flowed from beneath a magnificent arch forming the entrance to a vast cavern the rocks which surrounded it being covered with superb trees and rich vegetation of most varied hue nourished by the ever flowing stream | here were the gigantic mammee tree and the genipa with large and shining leaves raising their branches vertically towards the sky while others extending their boughs horizontally formed a thick canopy of verdure over the entrance | orchidae and a host of plants whose names i do not know grew out of the clefts of the rocks while creepers waved in the wind or formed a graceful drapery of festoons hanging from the boughs decked with flowers of nearly all the colours of the rainbow some of purple others of orange colour many of bright yellow and numbers perfectly white glittering like stars amid the dark green of the surrounding foliage | we all stood for a few seconds lost in astonishment at the unexpected scene |  in the recesses of this cavern my friends you may remain as long as you desire without danger of being discovered by your enemies observed kanimapo |  the gothos are unacquainted with its existence and but few of our people indeed know the way to it | abundance of wild fruit is to be found in the woods and game of all sorts is plentiful while the cavern itself will manage to afford us an ample supply of food should we be prevented from going forth to search for it | as may be supposed we were eager to explore the cavern but my mother and sister as well as my father and the padre were too much fatigued to make the attempt | my father suggested therefore that we should encamp in a shady spot at the entrance and take some food after which those who were so disposed might under the guidance of the indian set off on the proposed exploration | the doctor's eagerness however would scarcely allow him to consent to this delay but as he was not disposed to go alone or accompanied only by jumbo he agreed to wait till gerald and i had had some dinner after which we had promised we would set off with him provided kanimapo would act as our guide | the indian consented to lead the way as far as he had ever before been but he confessed that he had never penetrated to the end | indeed he believed that no human being had ever done so and he hinted that we should be wise not to make the attempt as the place was full of the spirits of people who had departed this life and who might resent our intrusion |  i'll take care to settle that matter with them observed the doctor laughing |  i would sooner encounter ten thousand spirits than a single anaconda and jumbo has not the slightest fear of them | had the doctor denied the existence of the spirits he might have offended the indian as it was kanimapo only looked upon him as a wonderfully courageous person and treated him with even more respect than before | we immediately collected sticks and had a fire blazing before which candela exerted his culinary powers in preparing our repast while we arranged as usual some huts for my mother and the rest of the family | the indian had in the meantime formed a bundle of torches of some resinous wood which he cut with his machete |  we shall require these he observed for the light of day cannot penetrate beyond a quarter of the length of the cavern | as soon as our provisions were cooked the doctor almost bolted his share and then proposed setting off | gerald and i were soon ready and the indian who evidently felt a pride in the cavern said that he would lead the way | he took a couple of torches himself and divided the rest among us inquiring of the doctor whether he had the means of producing a light |  i am never without these was the answer lead on my friend and we will follow | our astonishment was increased when we found that the vegetation extended far away into the depths of the cavern growing on both sides of the stream which proceeded out of it even palms arums and other plants reaching to the height of fifteen or twenty feet |  hark to the sound which proceeds from the inner part of the cavern said our guide | as he spoke strange suppressed cries issued from the interior but so low that we did not at first remark them almost drowned as they were by the noise of the rushing waters | from the immense size of the entrance and the direct course the cavern took into the interior of the mountain daylight penetrated for a great distance and we were accordingly able to proceed for upwards of four hundred feet before we found it diminishing to any extent | as we advanced the sounds we had at first heard so indistinctly increased and kanimapo told us that they were produced by birds which had taken up their abode in the cavern in thousands | the shrill and piercing cries of these denizens of the cavern striking on the vaulted rock were repeated by the subterranean echoes till they created such a wild din as is difficult to describe | well might an ignorant native entering for the first time have supposed that they were the shrieks of departed souls | the farther we went the louder and more horrible was the noise | entering a region of darkness we were at length compelled to light our torches when holding them up we could see birds flitting about in all directions their long nests fixed in the roof and sides of the cavern | we walked on slowly and cautiously to avoid the risk of falling into any hollow which might exist in the ground but generally it was tolerably smooth and level covered everywhere with herbage of a pale hue evidently as the doctor observed the produce of seeds dropped by the birds | though not so wide as at the entrance the magnificence of the cavern was greatly increased by the countless stalactites which hung from the roof some reaching to the ground and forming pillars with arches of the most delicate tracery which often shone brilliantly as the light of our torches fell on them | the farther we got the more fantastic were the forms they assumed till with a little aid from the imagination we might have fancied ourselves in some wonderful temple of an eastern region | so numerous were the columns we could with difficulty make our way between them sometimes having to descend into the bed of the river which was nowhere more than two feet deep though from twenty to thirty feet wide | all this time the shrieks of the birds sounded in our ears | at last after continuing on for a considerable distance a still more curious and beautiful spectacle than we had yet seen burst on our view | the ground suddenly sloped upwards at a sharp angle thickly covered with vegetation in the midst of which the river came rushing over a ledge of rock forming a cascade which sparkled as the light of our torches fell on it while the brilliantly white stalactites which descended from the roof were seen against the foliage of the trees | having climbed up the rise i have mentioned we went on as before by the side of the stream the ground being of a uniform level | as we looked back the opening of the cavern appeared greatly contracted the distant light of day forming a strange contrast to the darkness which here surrounded us | the roof now became lower the sides contracted to little more perhaps than forty or fifty feet while the cries of the birds became more and more shrill | our indian guide though he had shown his bravery on many occasions seemed unwilling to go much farther but the doctor urged him to make the attempt promising to defend him against all evil spirits which we might encounter | while he was speaking the light attracted some of the birds which in their eagerness flew towards us and the doctor and i managed to knock down two greatly to his delight | the character of the cavern remained the same and though our curiosity prompted us to try and reach the end we began to consider that it would take us a long time to do so and that our torches must shortly burn done | the same idea had occurred to kanimapo who again begged the doctor to return warning him of the danger we ran in attempting to make our way in the dark over the uneven ground |  you are right my friend answered the doctor | i agreed with him also and turning our faces to the entrance we retraced our steps | we were welcomed by our friends who had become somewhat anxious at our long absence and gerald after expatiating on the wonders we had seen acknowledged that he was glad to get beyond the hearing of the hoarse cries of the birds | as we seated ourselves by the side of the rivulet in front of the cavern the doctor examined the birds we had killed and calling to the indian he made inquiries as to what he knew about them | he answered that in another part of the country where a similar cavern exists inhabited by the same birds they are called guacharos that in that other cavern the cave of caripe as he called it thousands of birds exist and that the indians take the young birds for the sake of the oil which they contain | they enter it once a year armed with long poles with which they destroy all the nests they can reach when the old ones hovering about their heads attempt to defend their broods uttering the most terrible cries | the young birds which are thus killed are immediately opened and the fat being taken out it is melted in pots of clay over fires lighted at the entrance of the cave | during the oil harvest as the indians call that time they build huts with palm leaves in which they live till they have melted down the fat | it is half liquid transparent without any smell and so pure that it may be kept above a year without becoming rancid | the race of birds would become extinct were not the natives afraid of entering into the depths of the cavern as also because there are other and smaller caverns inaccessible to the hunters inhabited by colonies of birds from which the larger cavern is peopled | these birds are of the size of ordinary fowls their mouths resemble those of goat suckers and their appearance is somewhat that of small vultures but unlike the goat suckers they live entirely on fruits of a hard dry character and such fruits only were found in the crops of the birds we killed | the natives believe that the seeds found in the birds' crops are a specific against intermittent fevers and these are therefore carefully collected and sent to the low regions where such fevers prevail | the doctor was delighted with the information he had obtained and declared that for the sake of it he would have been ready to undergo ten times as much fatigue and danger as that to which he had been subjected | we were all well pleased with the romantic beauty of the scenery but my father was not quite satisfied that the place was secure from attack | should we be betrayed there was nothing to prevent our enemies from following us and there was no position in which we could defend ourselves against them | kanimapo confessed that such was the case but he added there is a spot at hand to which i can lead you where you will be secure from a whole army of gothos | it is separated from this by a deep valley the cliffs above which no armed men can climb | in the side of the mountain there is a cavern very much smaller than this but which has the advantage of being perfectly dry as the sun shines directly into it | there should enemies approach we might take refuge and remain without fear of being reached till they have taken their departure |  but how if the sides are perpendicular are we to reach it | asked my father |  i will find the means of gaining the top answered the indian |  a lofty rock on the opposite side is not more than fifty feet distant from a part of the cliff at this place i will carry across a rope bridge by which you may all pass in safety and should an enemy attempt to follow a blow of a machete would hurl him to destruction | you can thus have your choice of either remaining in this large cavern or taking refuge in the smaller cave i have described to you | my father consulted the doctor and the padre who were both of opinion that we should be perfectly safe where we were but he thought it wisest to secure a refuge in case we should be pursued and begged the indian to lead him to it | kanimapo replied that he required some time to make preparations but that as soon as he was ready he would let us know | calling candela he led him some way down the valley towards a grove of trees among which were a great variety of creepers | we meantime were employed in improving our huts and in making arrangements for a sojourn in the cave hoping that we might not be disturbed | after some time kanimapo and candela reappeared carrying between them a coil of stout rope and a sort of square cradle of network large enough to contain a man | it was by this time too late to commence operations but kanimapo undertook to conduct us to the place the first thing the next morning |  that you may not feel insecure my friends he said i will take post at the entrance of the valley during the night and give you due notice should any danger approach | this offer was gladly accepted and darkness soon coming on we made up a blazing fire in front of our huts and prepared to pass the first night in our strange abode | the scene can be better pictured than described | the night passed quietly away even the sounds of the birds from the far interior of the cavern scarcely reaching our ears | so high was the vaulted roof that as we looked upwards it had the appearance of a clouded sky while the light from the fire which fell on the trunks and lower branches of the trees by the side of the stream scarcely reached the opposite walls of the cave | soon after daylight kanimapo appeared | he had climbed to a height from whence he could look far away along the only path by which the valley could be approached and had failed to make out any fire at night or smoke in the daytime which could indicate a camp of pursuers | as my father was anxious that we should lose no time after taking a hurried breakfast he and gerald and i set off kanimapo and candela leading the way up the hill which overhung the valley | after proceeding for some distance we reached the summit of the hill on which grew a tree of considerable size while opposite to it rose a perpendicular cliff surmounted by several pointed rocks | we looked in vain however for the entrance to the cavern which kanimapo told us was to be found farther round the hill | having left the thick rope and cradle he begged us to remain while he descended the valley | a short time afterwards he appeared to our surprise on the summit of the opposite side with his bow in his hand and an arrow to which he had attached a long thin line | shouting to us to stand aside he shot it into the trunk of the tree and then desired us to fasten the end of the rope to the line with his arrow | on this being done he hauled the stout rope across and fastened it to one of the pointed rocks | the other end i should have said had already been secured round the tree | having told candela to fix the cradle he again shot the arrow with the thin line and this being attached to the cradle by means of the line he drew it across to him | the desired communication was now established so placing himself in the cradle and standing upright with his hands holding on to the rope he worked himself backwards till he reached the side on which we were standing |  but surely my friend you don't expect the ladies to cross over in this conveyance | said my father |  and i suspect that the padre and even the doctor would very much object to it |  no but by its means we can form a bridge of any size and strength answered the indian |  should it be necessary i will during the day manufacture the ropes requisite for such a bridge | in the meantime i will leave candela to carry across a supply of wood for firing as well as provisions | to my surprise candela willingly undertook to do this and terrific as the bridge appeared crossed without hesitation indeed provided a person has nerve enough and the rope is sound there is no difficulty in crossing by one of these aerial bridges which exist in all parts of this mountainous region | they are formed in a variety of ways some consisting of six or more ropes and sometimes even mules and horses are dragged across suspended below them | gerald and i having seen how to work the cradle went across and visited the cavern in which could we store it with provisions we agreed that we might set a whole host of enemies at defiance for the mouth was not to be seen from the opposite cliff and no bullets could reach it | a person might also be stationed under shelter close by the rock to which the rope was fastened so that he could cut it without exposing himself to a shot from the opposite side | these arrangements having been made we rejoined our party | from the account we gave of the citadel as we called it the general wish was that we might not be compelled to take refuge there | gerald laughed at the fears the doctor and the padre expressed that they should not be able to get across |  it is not a bit worse than taking a good swing he answered all you have to do is to haul away keep your eyes fixed on the sky and forget that you have got two or three hundred feet between you and the earth |  that is the very thing my friend which it is difficult to do observed the doctor |  neither could i forget that the rope might possibly give way nor that i might grow giddy and let go my grasp | we then explained that the indian intended to carry over several ropes and that consequently some of the contingencies could not occur |  that one might happen would be quite sufficient to make the passage disagreeable observed the doctor so i heartily hope that we may not have to cross | our friend kanimapo was indefatigable he was evidently very proud of the confidence placed in him and he showed that he was fully equal to the responsibilities he had assumed | he was employed all day either in shooting birds or monkeys of which there were several species in the woods or in watching the approach to the valley of the cavern | the horses and mules could not get to the upper valley but there was ample pasturage below the second waterfall in a spot where they might remain concealed the only risk being that a jaguar might find them out |  those brutes roam everywhere observed kanimapo over mountains and across plains and they often come into these higher regions in search of deer so that we must be on our guard against them | it will be necessary therefore either to leave your white slave tim would have strongly disapproved of being so designated or chumbo or candela to watch them | another day passed and tim and chumbo not appearing we began to feel very anxious about them | in other respects we had every reason to be contented with our lot the woods produced various wild fruits which were now in perfection we had as much game as we required and the padre and candela caught an ample supply of fish | the doctor was engaged in botanising and studying various branches of natural history and my father was thankful that his family were in comparative safety | perhaps i felt our retirement from the world more than any one else as i longed to be taking part in the task to which i had pledged myself of aiding in the liberation of my country | kanimapo at last expressed his surprise that tim and the mules had not arrived and assuring us that we should be perfectly safe provided we remained in the valley he left us saying that he would go in search of them | another day passed and as neither the indian nor tim appeared gerald and i agreed to go down the valley in case they might have missed each other and tim should have found his way to the spot to which he had been directed | nothing could exceed the beauty of the vegetation on the banks of the stream or the magnificence of the trees which here and there shot up in this oasis among the mountains while its elevated position gave it a far more temperate and refreshing atmosphere than that to which we were accustomed even in our own district | our scanty supply of powder made us refrain from shooting any of the numberless birds we saw fluttering amid the trees or skimming along the surface of the water | among them were several species of beautiful humming birds which as they darted here and there glittered like gems in the air | gerald told me that norah and he were so delighted with the valley that they intended to try and persuade our father to migrate to it and build a house where we might all live in happy seclusion from the world |  you have forgotten that it would be somewhat difficult to obtain supplies in such a sequestered home and still more so to send the produce of our industry to market i observed |  it might do very well for a summer retreat but i suspect that we should grow very tired of it were we to attempt to live here all the year round | we had now reached the end of the valley and were venturing beyond the boundaries prescribed by our indian friend so i proposed turning back |  let us go on a little farther said gerald |  i caught a glimpse of an animal through the trees but we shall get a better sight of it directly | we went on and in another minute saw directly below us two fine deer feeding in a small glade | they did not mind us but remained quietly browsing | i signed to gerald to aim at one while i tried to shoot the other | my finger was on the trigger when as i looked to the left the head and shoulders of a huge jaguar appeared | so noiselessly did the animal steal through the brushwood that the deer were not startled while intent on seizing its prey the jaguar did not discover us | the next moment it gave a tremendous spring crashing through the boughs and pounced down on the nearest deer | gerald at the same moment fired and killed the other | i waited till i could take good aim and to my great satisfaction shot the jaguar through the head | having put an end to the sufferings of the deer the jaguar had seized we lost no time in dragging them both out of the thicket and hoisting them up to the bough of a tree with some ever serviceable sepos | we were then on the point of hastening back to obtain the assistance of the doctor and candela to carry home our prizes when we caught sight of some objects moving in the distance | silver chain and hooks ornamented with turquoises used to fasten women's cloaks | p 195 fig

the terai i was occupied during the month of april in preparations for an expedition to the loftier parts of sikkim | the arrangements were the same as for my former journey except with regard to food which it was necessary should be sent out to me at intervals for we had had ample proof that the resources of the country were not equal to provisioning a party of from forty to fifty men even had the dewan been favourable to my travelling which was clearly not the case | dr campbell communicated to the rajah my intention of starting early in may for the upper teesta valley and in the governor general's name requested that he would facilitate my visiting the frontier of sikkim north east of kinchinjunga | the desired permission was after a little delay received which appeared to rouse the dewan to institute a series of obstructions to my progress which caused so many delays that my exploration of the country was not concluded till october and i was prevented returning to dorjiling before the following christmas | since our visit to the rajah in december no vakeel agent had been sent by the durbar to dorjiling and consequently we could only communicate indirectly with his highness while we found it impossible to ascertain the truth of various reports promulgated by the dewan and meant to deter me from entering the country | in april the lassoo kajee was sent as vakeel but having on a previous occasion been dismissed for insolence and incapacity and again rejected when proposed by the dewan at bhomsong he was refused an audience and he encamped at the bottom of the great rungeet valley where he lost some of his party through fever | he retired into sikkim exasperated pretending that he had orders to delay my starting in consequence of the death of the heir apparent and that he was prepared to use strong measures should i cross the frontier | no notice was taken of these threats: the rajah was again informed of my intended departure unless his own orders to the contrary were received through a proper accredited agent and i left dorjiling on the 3rd of may accompanied by dr campbell who insisted on seeing me fairly over the frontier at the great rungeet river | arrangements were made for supplies of rice following me by instalments our daily consumption being 80 lbs a man's load | after crossing into sikkim i mustered my party at the great rungeet river | i was afraid to risk a shot at the one with which chumbo was engaged in combat lest i might injure him i therefore rushed forward and dealt it a blow on the head with the butt of my rifle which fortunately stunned it and enabled chumbo to cast it from him to a distance just at the moment that one of its claws had reached his legs | i then took aim at one of the birds perched on the boughs which i happily brought to the ground |  now run chumbo |run  before the rest of the creatures come down upon us i shouted out |  let me get hold of this one first massa barry he answered and seizing his late antagonist by the neck he dragged it along while i treated the one i had just shot after the same manner | the report of my gun at first startled them but on their discovering that no other bird of their community had suffered they flew after us uttering loud shrieks | i defended myself by using my gun as a cudgel while chumbo picking up a thick stick fought them bravely swinging it round and round his head so that none of them ventured within its reach | so persevering were their attacks that they gave me no time to load or i might have brought another to the ground as it was i had considerable difficulty in protecting my head from their sharp beaks and talons | still we would not let go our prey and each time we beat them off we ran on so as to gain a farther distance till at length after sweeping round our heads several times they flew back to finish the carrion feast at which chumbo had disturbed them and we carried off their two dead companions in triumph | i knew the birds from the rich scarlet on their heads their lemon coloured necks the satiny white of their backs tinged with fawn the black pinions of the wings and their neck surrounded with a ruff of grey feathers to be king vultures | those we had killed were full grown and were about the size of an ordinary goose | as i saw them perched on the branches tearing away at huge masses of flesh i must say that notwithstanding their regal titles they had a very repulsive appearance | chumbo told me how in despair of getting any supper he had rushed in and attacked the vulture with which i had found him struggling | happily he had come off without any material injury | on our way back to where i had left gerald and tim i showed him the two deer we had killed and this reconciled him to remaining with the horses and mules | before leaving him however tim and i built him a hut and collected an ample supply of wood for a fire so that he might pass the night in security provided he could manage to awake at intervals and replenish his fire | we then cut up one of the deer and leaving a portion of the flesh for chumbo loaded ourselves with as much of the rest as we could carry | tim added one of the vultures to his cargo as a present to the doctor and without further delay we set off for our settlement as we called the huts we had erected at the entrance of the cave | tim received a hearty welcome candela clapped his hands as he saw the venison and the doctor was highly pleased to have the king vulture to examine | he remarked that it was unusual to find the bird in such high regions as it generally inhabits the low thickly wooded districts on the banks of the rivers but though birds and beasts of all sorts found out our happy valley and made it their abode it would be satisfactory to believe that no anaconda or boa constrictor had wriggled its way over the mountains to get to it or any vicious little peccaries | we had a proof however that we must be on our guard against jaguars and pumas which have a wide range and do not hesitate to climb mountains and ford streams in search of their prey especially pumas which are met with throughout central america and far away in the western parts of the northern continent | the next morning the doctor accompanied us back to skin the jaguar i had shot and to bring home the remainder of the venison with the exception of a portion left for chumbo which he cut up into strips and dried in the sun so that it might keep good for some time | in the course of a few days we had become quite accustomed to our mode of life though we were somewhat anxious at the non appearance of kanimapo | we could not suppose after the faithful way in which he had behaved that he had purposely deserted us so we began to fear that he must have been captured by the spaniards or had met with some accident | we believed however that we should have no difficulty in making our way out of our happy valley whenever we might wish to quit it | the question was how we should obtain information as to the state of affairs in the country and when it might be prudent for us to return home | at last i made up my mind to set off and learn how things were going on and either to make my way to our village or to try and reach the residence of don fernando | the doctor had no wish to quit the valley as he observed that he could spend many months in it with infinite satisfaction to himself and to the advantage of the scientific world but when one day i mentioned my resolution he magnanimously offered to accompany me |  i as a foreigner and a medical man shall run no risk he observed and you can pass for my attendant or guide and we shall be able to go wherever you wish | i thanked him for his offer and said that i would try and obtain my father's leave to set off but still i waited hoping that kanimapo would come back before long | in the meantime we rambled at liberty through the valley gerald and i often escorting norah and kathleen sometimes even the children with margarita the younger nurse accompanying us | one day not content with our ramble through the upper valley norah proposed that we should visit the lower one as she wished to make a sketch of the waterfall | she forgot that though kanimapo considered it tolerably secure he had advised that the ladies at all events should limit their walks to the upper valley |  we will not go far said norah and we shall be sure to see chumbo should he by chance come with a warning that danger is at hand | the baby i should say had remained with our mother kathleen and mary had come with margarita | we managed without much difficulty to help our sisters to scramble down the cliffs | gerald said he would go forward and learn how chumbo was getting on and as i wished to shoot some birds or any large game i could meet with for our larder i left my sisters seated in the shade at a spot from which norah wished to make her view of the waterfall | i had brought but a small supply of powder and having shot some birds i loaded my gun with my last charge resolved not to fire it except in case of necessity | i was tempted however to break through my resolution on seeing a deer burst from the wood and offer a shot i could not resist | but my gun for the first time during the day hung fire and when i again pulled the trigger though it went off the deer escaped | vexed with my ill luck i turned my face up the valley and arrived almost close to the spot where i knew my sisters were seated but what was my horror to see a huge jaguar stealing through the brushwood and on the point of springing towards where i had left them | i mechanically lifted my gun to my shoulder but recollected that it was not loaded | i felt like a person in a dreadful dream endeavouring to shriek out but unable to utter a sound when just as the savage brute was about to make its spring i caught a glimpse of the tall figure of an indian on the opposite bank and at the same moment an arrow whizzing through the air pierced the jaguar to the heart and it fell over dead | i rushed forward and found kathleen with her arms thrown round margarita's neck within ten paces of where the jaguar lay | they had seen the creature when margarita had fixed her gaze on its eyes and by thus preventing it from making the fatal spring had given time to the indian to shoot it | on looking out to see what had become of my young sisters' preserver i observed him crossing the river and in another minute he came up to us and i recognised our missing friend kanimapo |  i warned you not to descend into this valley my friend he observed and thankful am i to have preserved you from the jaws of yonder savage brute | you may have been surprised at my long absence but it could not be avoided | i was pursued by my enemies and compelled to fly towards the south when i received intelligence that my own people supposing that i had been killed were about to elect another chief and that unless i returned at once i should find a rival and lose my influence over them | instigated by spanish priests and others their intention was to attack the house of don fernando where they expected to find a rich booty | i arrived in time to prevent them from making the attack or electing a chief in my stead | but i must speedily return as i fear that under evil influence they may endeavour to injure your friends and as i have sworn to you your friends shall ever be mine | i also bring you intelligence that the spaniards have been driven out of this part of the country and that general bermudez with a large body of horsemen occupies the senor padre's village so that you and he may return to your homes with safety | he gave us this information while we were hastening back through the valley gerald having by this time rejoined us | as may be supposed it was received with great satisfaction by our party especially by the padre who was anxious to get back among his people and to be actively engaged in forwarding the cause to which he had devoted himself | fortunately our animals had not suffered from the jaguars though chumbo had seen the very creature which was so nearly pouncing down on kathleen but had driven it off with firebrands | we at once therefore made preparations for our departure |  i am indeed thankful that we have suffered so little hardship said my mother adding as she looked up at the mountain above us and especially so that we have not had to cross that terrible rope bridge to our citadel | though kanimapo did not understand her remark he observed her gesture |  we may some day have to make use of yonder retreat he said to me and before we go i will remove the bridge that none of our enemies may discover it | calling to candela he at once descended the hill and they returned soon after with the rope and cradle which they hid away in the cavern | we were busily employed for the remainder of the day in collecting fruit killing game and preparing for our journey | chapter eight | return journey commenced norah's confession a bamboo bridge unexpectedly prevented from crossing foes and friends appear the bridge gained a fierce struggle i take part in it we defeat the enemy my family return homewards under an escort i join general bermudez the doctor and the padre promise to follow us i accompany the army and we encamp on the plains the doctor appears and remains with the army our numerous exploits capture of caracas i am sent with despatches to bolivar discovered by the enemy a race for life i am wounded and captured carried to la guayra thrown into prison | the description i have given of the mountain scenery amid which we travelled on our flight from home will in many respects serve for that through which we passed on our return by a different and somewhat more easy route | though the sides of the mountains were steep and rugged the valleys were fertile with streams meandering through them and in many places we saw herds of deer among which were two or three beautiful milk white animals but having exhausted nearly all our powder we were unable to shoot them even had we wished to do so | we saw also a number of wild turkeys: and in the woods we heard micos a small species of monkey whistling to each other but the moment the rogues caught sight of us they disappeared among the branches | the roughness of the paths we followed prevented the horses from going beyond a slow walk and even norah though a good horsewoman was glad to have me at the head of her steed | i told her how much i wished to join general bermudez |  i shall be sorry to lose you barry she rejoined still i believe that it is your duty to go | i only wish that i could serve my country as you have the power of doing | still more do i wish that the hateful spaniards were driven from our shores and the blessings of peace restored | i then told her for i had never before done so how much i admired don fernando's young ward isabella monterola |  perhaps if i return from the wars crowned with laurels she'll have me i said laughing | she sighed and the colour i observed mounted to her brow |  don carlos serrano has other sons besides the one i met under the name of colonel acosta i remarked |  yes she answered his second son carlos is as brave and devoted as his brother | should you meet barry make yourself known to him and i am sure that he will be glad to give you his friendship | in appearance he is very like his elder brother though perhaps handsomer and you cannot fail to recognise him | i began to suspect from the way in which norah spoke of the young don carlos that she was deeply interested in him and soon afterwards i had reason to know that i was not mistaken | we stopped to rest and take our noonday meal near a small clump of trees on the borders of a wide stream which we were afterwards to pass | across it was thrown a curious bamboo bridge the lower portion of which rested on the calm water beneath it | the bamboos of which it was composed were securely lashed together by sepos making it very elastic | the sides were so steep as to form rather a sharp angle with each other while so great was the ascent and descent that to enable people and animals to pass along it without slipping pieces of bamboo in which to fix the feet were placed at short intervals across the footway | slight as was the bridge in appearance owing to its yielding nature there was no danger of its breaking and we saw two or three persons crossing it with mules so that we had no fear about going over it ourselves | we were about to recommence our journey when candela and chumbo who had been attending to our animals at a little distance came hurrying up and said that they had seen a large body of men appearing above a ridge on our side of the river and urged that we should lose no time in moving | i ran to a slight hillock near where we had been seated and from thence i could distinguish the men they spoke of: they were evidently infantry and in considerable force as i caught the gleam of their bayonets forming a long line as they surmounted the ridge | i was assisting norah to mount while the doctor was putting the children into the panniers when he cried out we are in a trap |see  there are troops on the opposite side coming this way and if we cross we may fall into their hands |  but they may be friends i said | yes  they are friends cried the padre they are cavalry the llaneros of the plain i can make out their lances against the sky | they are dashing on at full speed none but they could ride over that rough ground | paez or perchance bermudez is at their head |  you are right friend padre they are pushing on to gain the bridge before yonder infantry can reach it cried my father his martial enthusiasm kindling |  the enemy's object is to gain the bank of the river first and dispute their passage before they can cross and form on this side |see  the spaniards are advancing at the double scrambling over all impediments it is a question which will reach the river first | there will be some warm work anon |  if you will be advised by me mr desmond in that case you will retreat to a safe distance and place the ladies and children under shelter observed the doctor |  bullets make no distinction of persons and they will be flying pretty thickly about our ears if we venture to remain here much longer |  thank you doctor for your advice answered my father and he forthwith placed my mother on horseback | the children had been meantime tumbled into their panniers and the nurse mounted on her mule | leading the animals we hurried along the bank of the river hoping to reach some sheltering rock which would afford protection to the helpless ones under our care | happily before long we found what we were in search of | as soon as i had seen my family in safety i sprang out again and hurried back towards the spot we had left eager to watch what was going forward and to take a part in the strife if i had the opportunity | as i reached it i saw that the front rank of the spanish infantry had got to within two or three hundred yards of the bank while the republican cavalry came thundering down the hill their leader on a powerful charger considerably in advance | as he came nearer i recognised my proposed chief general bermudez | he was making directly for the bridge lance in hand and couched as if he were already within reach of the foe | onward he dashed the bridge was nearly won | the commander of the infantry saw that the advantage he had hoped to gain was on the point of being lost and waving his sword sprang forward in front of his men | but the brave bermudez was not to be disappointed | without pulling rein he galloped his horse on to the fragile bridge which bent beneath the weight of the steed and its rider and every instant i expected to see it give way | soon he reached the shore on which i stood and urged his horse up the steep bank and one by one the llaneros came rattling after him and formed rapidly by his side | already a score had crossed before the infantry had got within musket shot of them and the spaniards saw that the advantage they had hoped to gain was almost lost still by a well directed discharge they might annihilate the small band opposed to them | as they got within range of the horsemen therefore they opened fire along their whole line the shot came whistling through the air like a hail shower and two of the llaneros fell from their horses dead | seized by an impulse i could not withstand i caught one of the animals and dashing forward to where the dead man's lance lay on the ground i seized it and galloped up to the side of the general | as i did so he gave me a glance of recognition and at the same moment the order to charge burst in a loud ringing voice from his lips | couching my lance i gave my steed the rein and our small but compact body advanced like an avalanche against the foe | in vain those who had fired attempted to reload their bayonets were all they had to depend on | had they been british troops the case would have been different but as they saw the bristling line of spears come down like lightning upon them the front rank sprang up from their knees and seized with a panic turned to fly | it would have been better to die like men with their faces to the foe | piercing them through and through we drove them before us and they pressing on the rear ranks carried confusion into their midst | still the officers did their utmost to induce them to stand and i saw them cut down several of the fugitives but it was in vain | our party too was every instant increased by fresh bands of llaneros as they crossed the bridge while the confusion among the enemy became rapidly greater | no lives were spared | bermudez appeared to be everywhere now in the centre of his men now on one flank now on the other | the unevenness of the ground did not stop us on we went our lances dealing death around | i take no delight in describing horrors or i might vividly paint this my first battle field | the lance of general bermudez pierced the spanish commander | not an officer escaped | a few of the men managed to scramble up some almost inaccessible heights but of the rest every man was killed no quarter was asked and none was given | i had kept close to the side of the general and on several occasions had used my pistols when he had been almost overmatched | having seen the last of the fugitives disappear he turned round to me and putting out his hand exclaimed in a hearty voice you have done good service my friend | i remember you well you are welcome very welcome | we have met at length and i hope not to part for many a day | he then as i rode alongside of him told me that he appointed me lieutenant in his band and that i must accept the horse i had ridden and the lance which i had wielded so well | i of course felt highly flattered at the encomiums passed on me and told him how glad i should be to accompany him for the future but that i could not leave my parents without their permission |  go and get it at once then said the general had i known where to find you i should have sent for you before | you have shown that you are well able to take a part in our glorious struggle | the llaneros having picketed their horses in a meadow close to the bank of the river had begun to cook their provisions in the rough fashion they usually adopt | on my telling the general where my family were he desired me to offer them an escort for the rest of their journey to make amends for my absence as he wished me to continue with him | i accordingly rode back to where i had left my party | they were much astonished to see me mounted on a strong horse with a long lance in my hand and to hear how i had been engaged for they had feared that i might have been entangled among the combatants and perhaps killed | my father did not hesitate for a moment to give me the permission i asked and gladly accepted the general's offer of an escort | my mother and norah were somewhat agitated but still they had no objections |  go barry said my mother and may heaven protect you during the dangers to which you may be exposed for i cannot hide them from my eyes | norah pressed her lips to my cheek |  you will come back barry crowned with laurels and with a colonel's commission i feel sure she said and my brother remember the message i gave you yesterday | the padre and the doctor expressed their intention of following me back to the general as they both wished to offer their services |  i have vowed to support the cause of true religion and i am sure such will never exist while the spaniards are in the land exclaimed the padre |  i therefore feel bound to do my best to drive them out and having got rid of all extra flesh i am as fit for a campaign as any of those fighting in the cause | i replied that i would tell the general of their intentions | gerald kept alongside my horse for some little distance |  do tell him that i wish he would take me too he said i will ask our father's leave and i think he will give it | if i can't handle a lance as well as a grown man i can use a carbine and pistols and might do duty as an ensign | i told him that i would mention his wish to the general but that i thought he ought to remain and assist our father in protecting the family indeed i had no wish young as he was that he should be exposed to the dangers he would inevitably have to go through | at last wringing his hand i told him to go back while i galloped on | the general was pleased with my alacrity | he immediately ordered six of his own guard to escort my father and afterwards to rejoin him at the foot of the hills | i set off at the head of the men | my family had in the meantime recommenced their journey and i met them approaching the bamboo bridge | soon afterwards i had the satisfaction of seeing them cross it in safety under the escort of the llaneros for it was still entire notwithstanding the severe strain put on it | the doctor and the padre had meanwhile arrived and having paid their respects to the general they promised to rejoin him in the plains and then hastened after my family | the doctor as he was going told me that he could not bring himself to abandon his chests and that he hoped to find means to carry them in safety down the orinoco to angostura whence he could ship them to europe he having learned that the whole of that part of the country was in the hands of the patriots | for a few days i felt very strange with my wild untutored associates but i soon got into their ways and by never hesitating to perform any deed however daring by activity and unfailing attention to my duties i gained their respect and found that young as i was they obeyed me willingly | i had the satisfaction too of receiving the very kind commendations of the general which encouraged me to persevere | by rapid marches and desperate onslaughts we beat the spaniards wherever we encountered them though they were better clothed and disciplined according to military notions and often more numerous than we were | by a sudden dash we gained the city of bogota and the spaniards being driven to the sea coast the whole of the mountainous part of the country declared for the republican cause | we then descended into the plains and lay encamped not far from the banks of the rio mita one of the numerous streams which having their source in the andes flow into the orinoco | the region was wild in the extreme the river made its way between lofty cliffs rising perpendicularly out of the stream which rushed down in a succession of cataracts between them | the troops were engaged in getting ready for the coming campaign which it was expected would be a brilliant one repairing saddles polishing up their arms and appointments and breaking in fresh horses | i was fully occupied in my various duties still i was occasionally able to take my gun and go into the woods with one or two companions for a few hours | neither the doctor nor the padre had yet made their appearance possibly from not being able to find us so i had not for long heard of my family and was feeling somewhat anxious about them | i had taken my gun one day and was making my way along the bank of the river when i stopped to observe one of the curious nests hanging at the extreme end of a palm branch | its structure was very curious and i observed that it had a small hole in the side which served as a doorway to the owner a black bird with an orange yellow tail about the size of a dove | i watched one bringing food to his mate who put out her beak to receive it and then fed her nestlings within | these nests are equally secure from snakes or monkeys as neither can descend the delicate boughs to which they are pendent nor can indeed climb the smooth stems of the trees | before me rose a perpendicular cliff like a wall of cyclopean masonry surmounted by trees and shrubs all around hung from the wide stretching boughs a rich tracery of sepos and creepers of all sorts vast arums hung suspended in the air and numberless gay coloured flowers while at my feet rushed boiling and foaming the rapid stream amid rocks against which the water broke in masses of spray | it was a place where i could scarcely have believed it possible that any boat however strongly built could have ventured to descend yet as i looked i saw a canoe or pongo guided by two natives with long poles the one in the bow and the other in the stern while in the centre sat composedly amidst a cargo of cases a passenger with his gun placed before him ready for use | in this passenger as the canoe shot by i recognised my friend the doctor | i shouted and waved to him and then pointed down the stream to let him understand that i would hurry on to the nearest landing place and meet him | he waved in return but the roar of the waters prevented our voices being heard by each other | in a moment he was out of sight so i hastened on in the hope of finding before long some calm water where the canoe could have ventured to put in to the shore | i went on and on but the water was still rushing as furiously as at first | in vain did i look for the canoe nothing could i see of her and i began to fear that she had been dashed to pieces against some of the ugly dark rocks whose tops rose above the surface | i had gone a mile or more when i saw a person approaching and soon afterwards the doctor and i were shaking hands |  i have been a long time in coming he said but i could find no men to convey my chests to the river: and when at length i did find them and reached the first navigable portion no canoe was forthcoming | however i was able at last to embark having engaged two faithful fellows who promised to pilot me to the ocean if i wished to go as far | so you see me here: and if general bermudez is still willing to accept my services i will remain with him | i replied that as we were about to recommence operations against the enemy i was sure that the general would be glad that he should remain | i then eagerly inquired about my family |  they are living in a cottage hastily put up near your old house which your father is engaged in rebuilding answered the doctor and i understand that your uncles are re roofing and repairing castle concannan | i asked him if my father had received any intelligence from don fernando serrano whether his house had escaped an attack from aqualonga |  yes he said |  the very day before i left a messenger arrived from don fernando bringing an invitation to the ladies of your family to stay with him while your house is rebuilding and i believe it was accepted by your sister norah though your mother preferred remaining with the children in their present abode | the messenger told us that they had been greatly alarmed by the near approach of the bandit chief but that happily he was encountered by some of the patriot troops and put to flight though he is supposed to be still in arms in the mountains | our friend kanimapo has returned to his tribe many of his people influenced by spanish emissaries being in a state of insubordination |  i trust that norah will have a good escort if she undertakes the journey i observed |  i wish that i could have been at home to accompany her for with these banditti still in arms on the one side and the wild indians on the other she would run a greater risk than i should like her to be exposed to | the doctor laughed at what he called my brotherly anxiety and remarked that the distance was but short that my father would certainly send tim and probably gerald with two or three trustworthy well armed blacks to escort her | on reaching the pongo the doctor directed his men to remain where they were while he accompanied me to the camp | the general was pleased to see him and at once sent a mule to bring back his portmanteau medicine chest and surgical instruments giving him a free pass for his men with a letter to a store keeper at angostura to whom he recommended him to confide his cases till he could despatch them to europe | soon after this we were on the march and were joined by other bodies of cavalry | i was gratified to see that none surpassed those of general bermudez however either in their appointments discipline or the appearance of the horses and men | general bolivar was at angostura with most of the infantry regiments of the republic with general paez and other leaders of distinction while the spaniards held most of the towns on the northern coast | our object was to harass the enemy in every possible way: to cut off their supplies of provisions to attack their foraging parties and prevent them from communicating with each other | for this work our llaneros were specially suited | it was wild work in which we were engaged | sometimes in the darkness of night we discovered the enemy's position by their camp fires when advancing at a slow pace so that our horses' hoofs might not be heard till we were close upon them at a signal from our chief we dashed forward like a whirlwind swooping down upon our sleeping foe and before a man had time to seize his arms we were in their midst cutting down all we encountered traversing the camp from end to end and carrying off all the horses we could capture then galloping off to a distance out of the reach of their musketry | we now heard that the spanish generals morillo and la torre had drawn off their forces from caracas the first to valencia and the latter to calabozo leaving but a small garrison in the former city | no sooner did our active general receive this information than he resolved to attempt the capture of the chief city of the province | our forces were at once put in motion | each one carried his own provisions in his haversack and forage of some sort was always to be obtained for our hardy steeds so that we marched across the country with incredible rapidity | as the inhabitants of the district through which we passed were in our favour no one gave information of our movements to the enemy and in a few days we reached the neighbourhood of the beautiful city just at nightfall | the greater part of the night was spent in recruiting our horses and ourselves and before dawn we were again in the saddle pushing on at a rapid rate towards our destination | we halted but for a few moments to form our ranks as the city appeared in sight | then the order to advance was given and almost before the garrison were aware of our approach we were rushing through the gates | but little or no opposition was offered for the spanish troops threw down their arms and endeavoured to conceal themselves | those who were discovered were i am sorry to say slain without mercy and in a few minutes the city was ours | most of the inhabitants were in our favour so that we had no difficulty in holding it till some infantry regiments arrived to relieve us and garrison the place | general bermudez then led us into the plains of apure where the independent army was preparing to go in search of the spanish forces | on the march the general sent for me and told me that he wished to send some important despatches to bolivar and asked if i would undertake to convey them |  there is some danger in the undertaking for you will have to pass near places occupied by the spaniards but i trust to your courage and sagacity to avoid them he observed |  i am ready to go wherever you desire to send me general i answered |  i knew that i could count on you he replied in a satisfied tone |  when will the despatches be ready | i asked |  they are already written | here they are | he said putting them into my hand | i took them and placed them in a leathern case slung over my back |  i will lose no time in starting i remarked as i left him | on the way to my quarters i met the doctor and told him where i was going |  i wish i could accompany you he said for i have little or nothing to do among your fellows | they are so hardy that not one is sick in a month and even the wounds they receive heal without my aid |  i should like your company my dear doctor i replied but i doubt if your horse would carry you as fast as i must make mine go | and i would rather you remained behind that you may inform my family as to what you suppose has become of me should i not return |  don't talk of that harry he exclaimed |  you must take care not to be captured by those bloodthirsty spaniards for if you are they will certainly put you to death |  you may depend on my doing my best to escape them i said laughing not that i had any fears on the subject | i was quickly ready and off i set making my horse move over the ground as llaneros are wont to do when work is before them | i had not gone far however before i learned from the peasantry that there were numerous parties of spaniards stationed in all directions to cut off the supplies of the patriot army and that the undertaking in which i was engaged was likely to prove far more dangerous than i had expected | accordingly i had to use the greatest caution galloping on only at night and concealing myself and my horse during the day in any clump of trees i could find or in some recess of the mountains except when the country appeared sufficiently open to enable me to put forth the powers of my steed and trust to his speed for escape | i had gone on for several leagues and believing that i had passed the last party of spaniards i was proceeding rather more leisurely than at first along a zigzag path cut in the side of a mountain with a steep precipice below me when i saw a strong body of men posted on a height at some distance above me | to turn back was as full of risk as to push forward | i determined on the latter course therefore and digging the spurs into my horse's flanks i dashed at headlong speed along the road | i had already placed the spaniards behind me when they suspecting that i was an enemy opened fire and their shot whizzed thickly about my ears | on i dashed but a false step might have sent me and my horse into the abyss below down which the stones clattered | suddenly i heard a thud such as a bullet produces when striking a substance and feeling my gallant steed give a convulsive spring i knew he was wounded | still he went on for nearly a hundred yards then he began to stagger and i had just time to clear my feet of the stirrups and throw myself off his back ere he rolled over into the rocky ravine | i did not stop a moment to see what became of him but ran forward as fast as my legs could carry me unslinging my despatch case as i did so and taking out the despatches which i hid beneath my shirt | i then gave the case a whirl in the air so that my pursuers might see it and swung it from me into the ravine | having still some hopes of escaping as it was possible my pursuers might attempt to secure the leathern case and allow me time to distance them before they could discover that it was empty i dashed on not even looking back to ascertain if they were following | at length i stopped but what was my dismay on taking a glance over my shoulder to see that half a dozen of the most active of the party were pressing hard after me | had the path continued down hill i should have succeeded in escaping but unhappily i found that the only way i could follow led directly up the steep side of a mountain where i must be exposed to the view of my pursuers | could i however reach the top so that i might once more have only to run down hill i might be safe and i knew that i could climb up hill faster than they could | i held on therefore | their object had probably been to take me alive that they might obtain information from me as to the movements of the combatants but seeing that i might escape them they halted and brought their muskets to their shoulders | as i turned my head for an instant i saw what they were about | yet even then i did not despair and on i bounded up the hill | the next moment i heard the bullets strike the ground round me and at the same time felt a peculiar sensation in my leg as if the cold end of a lance had entered it | i knew that i was hit but that no bone or muscle worth speaking of had been injured | though wounded i felt capable of considerable exertion and so casting another look behind me to ascertain what my enemies were about not dreaming of giving in i saw that they were reloading | still i might gain the top of the hill | once more the rattle of musketry sounded in my ears and a very unpleasant sound it is for the person at whom the balls are aimed |  a miss however is as good as a mile and though two or three bullets whistled close to my ears and another went through the sleeve of my jacket i was sure that i had escaped this second salvo | luckily the mass was so tightly packed that they fell through in a solid heap no one was hurt and all were able to enjoy the concert thoroughly |7  it is the soldier's bank and his postoffice | we were in one hut alone where more than fifteen thousand dollars were on deposit in the savings bank | the sale of stamps in this hut amounts to fifteen hundred dollars a month and of postal orders for the remittance of money home to more than four thousand dollars | every week an average of 28 000 letters are written and posted in this one room while thousands more are received and handed to the men |8  the association is the soldier's friend and tourist guide while he is visiting london paris or the other great cities | in some places one table is set apart where a chaplain or secretary is always on duty to help the soldiers make their wills find out their trains to london answer their questions or give them the friendly help they need | the y m c a stands by the soldier to the last and even after he falls | after the boy has fought his last fight and lies wounded or crippled or dying in the hospital in france it meets his parents and relatives and provides for their entire stay in the country | each relative of the wounded proceeding to france receives printed instructions from the war office that the y m c a will meet all the boats and provide transportation and accommodations for all who need it while at the front | our friend mr geddes broke down as he tried to tell us how he and his wife had been met on the lonely shores of france by the y m c a secretary and motored quickly to the bedside of their dying son only to find that they were just too late | the funeral was arranged even to the providing of flowers | the last ministry was performed for the young man away from home and for the loved ones left behind under the triangle that will forevermore be red | thus the association is at once the soldier's club his home his church his school his place of rest his entertainment bureau his bank and postoffice his tourist guide and the friend that stands by him and his bereaved parents at the last | fifteen hundred just such huts and centers stretch away from scotland to east africa from france to mesopotamia from egypt to india | could any other single organization have met all these needs of the men under arms mobilized so quickly united all denominations entered all lands and embraced all forms of work secular and religious | we conducted meetings for several months throughout the camps in the british isles | at our last parade service with the brigade out in the open field there were several thousand seated on the grass with their eight bands drawn up in front | in every service the battle was on between good and evil between god and mammon between sacrifice and sin | one night we visited the sailors' training camp | it was a great meeting with two thousand of the sailor boys crowded in a big theater | the concert was going on when we arrived and the jeers and yells of the crowd drowned some of the voices of the performers it was evident that we were going to have a hard time to hold the audience | captain peg stepped to the stage and soon had them singing we'll never let the old flag fall | roars of applause followed and they clamored for more | out in the glare of the footlights and looking into that sea of faces we began to fight for that audience | there were two thousand tempted men whom we should never see again | we sometimes slept in the open air and my wound as i lay on the hard ground caused me so much pain that i could scarcely sleep | at other times we stopped at guard houses where i was devoured by fleas and other insects for the men who escorted me were afraid of entering the villages the inhabitants being generally favourable to the patriot cause | we of course kept at a distance from caracas but i heard from my guards that general morales was marching from valencia with a powerful force for the purpose of recapturing it and on the very day that we reached la guayra i was further informed that he had entered the city and put the whole of the patriot garrison to the sword |  such will be the fate added my informant in a triumphant tone of all who oppose our rightful sovereign the king of spain | i thought it wise to make no reply to this remark | shortly afterwards we reached a strong castle close to the sea to the governor of which i was delivered up | though a spaniard he cast i thought a glance of commiseration at me and he whispered to an officer in attendance poor youth | he looks ill and weak | he has but a few days to live i suspect | i had indeed suffered much from the pain of my wound and the fatigue of the journey the food also with which i had been furnished was insufficient and coarse | i was nevertheless placed in a dungeon but i was supplied with a bed and bedding and a chair and table by the compassionate governor | there was also a small window strongly barred through which the fresh sea breeze blew into my cell so that i was better off than i had expected | all this time i had never been searched and had still the despatches about me | better food than i had hitherto been able to obtain was brought to me and had i not known that the fate of most prisoners captured as i had been was to be put to death i should have been tolerably contented in the hope of recovering and of some day or other regaining my liberty | chapter nine | in prison my jailer gives me unpleasant information sufferings from my wound i ask for a surgeon the doctor appears plan for escaping the doctor again comes to me the jailer informs me that i am to be strangled visited by a friar who proves to be an old friend escape reach the flying fish joined by the doctor and padre voyage up the orinoco land at angostura proceed on in a canoe scenes on the river adventure with peccaries turtle catching at night hunt for turtles' eggs mode of obtaining oil from them alligators and vultures land and proceed to the camp | in spite of the kindness i was receiving from the governor i could not help recollecting that i might at any time be led out and shot or be put to death in a more ignoble way | my wound too did not heal and at last i tried to persuade the jailer to take a message to the governor requesting that i might be attended by a surgeon | the man shrugged his shoulders observing that he believed no surgeons were to be found in the place and as far as he could judge a father confessor would be a more fitting visitor |  you think then that i am about to die | i asked |  to tell you the truth senor i believe that if you don't die of your wound you will very shortly in some other way he replied giving a sardonic grin |  general morillo is expected here | he is sure to order a jail delivery as we cannot take charge of more than a certain number of prisoners and it is said that we shall soon have a fresh arrival of captured rebels | this information was not very consolatory it made me doubly anxious to get well that i might try to effect my escape so i again pressed the jailer to obtain the favour i asked | he consented and next day when he visited my cell he told me that the commandant had sent into the town to ascertain if a surgeon was to be found and if so that he would be allowed to visit me | the jailer however again urged me to see a confessor in case i should die | i did not say that i certainly should not confess to him if he came but merely remarked that i would prefer having a surgeon who might at all events let me know should he think my case hopeless and if not try to cure me | some days passed by and my wound remained in the same state as before causing me much suffering | at last one forenoon the door opened and instead of my jailer whom i had expected i saw a tall figure with a cloak over his shoulders and a slouched hat standing in the doorway |  here is the surgeon come to do what he can for you said the jailer who put his head in behind the stranger |  take my advice and as soon as he is gone let me bring the father confessor to you he will be of most service in the end | now senor surgeon you will not be long about it |  i may take half an hour or possibly an hour answered the stranger in execrably bad spanish | i knew the voice it was that of doctor stutterheim | i had difficulty in restraining myself from jumping up and shaking him by the hand but i had sense enough to wait till the jailer had closed the door and retired |  why barry my boy barry | it is you then | i thought it must be from the account i heard said the doctor in a low voice as he approached me |  i am indeed barry my kind friend i exclaimed stretching out my hand |  how did you manage to discover me |  because i looked for you barry answered the doctor |  we heard at the camp that a young officer carrying despatches had been captured and when after a time you did not turn up i resolved to endeavour to find out where you were imprisoned |  where there's a will there's a way ' and i soon ascertained in what direction you had gone | as it was not known that i had been with the patriots i reassumed without difficulty my character of a travelling philosopher and managed at length to reach this place | i at once gave out that i was ready to exercise my skill on any sick people who desired to recover from their maladies of every sort and description and as i demanded very small fees i soon had numbers flocking to consult me | i made inquiries of all who came and thus learned that a young englishman whom i knew must be you was shut up in the castle | i was turning over in my mind various plans for getting access to you when i heard that the commandant was inquiring for a surgeon | i presented myself before him and from what he told me i had no longer any doubt that it was you he wished me to visit | he observed that i might try to heal your wound though he believed that it was of little use as you would probably be taken out and shot in a few days | i would not have told you this unless i had hoped in the first place to cure you and then to enable you to escape as i have determined in some way or other to do | now let me examine your wound | the doctor at once set to work but i need not describe his mode of operation | though i at first suffered some pain i ultimately felt more comfortable than i had done for a long time | he then gave me some medicines to strengthen me and promised that he would obtain leave from the commandant to send me some better food without which his remedies would be of little use | while he was dressing my wound he talked over various plans by which i might effect my escape |  i believe barry that a golden key will not answer | it may be dangerous to employ it | you must endeavour to get out there he said pointing up to the window |  if one of those iron bars can be removed you will have no difficulty in squeezing through | i can bring a file in my instrument case the next time as the cutting through those bars may prove a tedious business | but let me see | your bedstead is of iron and by wrenching off the side rail you will have the means of working much more rapidly than with a file |  but how shall i reach the window | i observed |  turn your bedstead up on end and you will have a ladder well fitted for your object he replied |  you must begin to night for you may not have much time to lose | replace it at daylight and if you have not succeeded go to work again directly the jailer has left you at night | you will find yourself i hope strong enough for that and before i come again to morrow i hope to have made some arrangements to facilitate your escape after you have got out of prison | i will report unfavourably of your case so that your guards may probably relax their watch over you and not suspect you of endeavouring to escape | after we had had a little more conversation the jailer appeared and inquired whether the doctor was ready to go |  i should be glad to remain longer with my poor young patient he answered shaking his head as he looked at me |  his is a desperate case you ought to have sent for me two weeks ago | as may be supposed i waited with anxiety till night came | though i was still somewhat weak as soon as the jailer had gone his last round i rose from my couch and managed to break off a piece of iron as the doctor had advised | i then placed the bedstead against the wall in a position which enabled me to stand on it so that i could work at the bars | next i looked out to ascertain where the sentries were posted and was thankful to see that none were opposite my cell window | by working away into the masonry i found that i could clear one of the bars out of its socket both above and below | the particles of stone and mortar which i dug out i carefully brushed off into my hand and placed on the ground where my bed stood | by morning to my great joy i found that the bar moved and that it could be wrenched out without much difficulty | as dawn broke i replaced my bedstead hiding the place where i had broken out the piece of iron with the bedclothes | i then got in and overcome with my exertions was soon asleep | when the jailer appeared he placed a small basket of provisions in addition to the usual prison fare on my table |  i thought i was right he said looking at me |  you are paler than yesterday | the doctor has done you no good | you had better let me send for a confessor | but before long he will be sure to come | prisoners of your rank are never sent out of the world without a visit from him |  when he comes i will do my best to satisfy him i answered evasively and the jailer with a shake of the head took his departure | later in the day the doctor appeared |  your young prisoner requires a severe operation he observed as he entered |  i won't ask you to wait as i can perform it alone but you need not be in a hurry to return | without looking to see whether the jailer had gone away he approached me and in a rough voice told me to show him my wound | he then dressed it as he had done before and whispered it is going on favourably but we must not let the commandant know that | i have good and bad news to give you good if you manage to make your escape but otherwise bad | i yesterday met an old friend of yours who commands a schooner which has come in here under english colours | finding him a bold dashing fellow i told him that a young englishman in whom i was interested was shut up in prison and would very likely be put to death if not rescued | when i mentioned your name he exclaimed i know him well | he came out with his uncle not long ago from england | i will run every risk to save the lad's life | with my brave fellows we might take the castle by surprise and before the spaniards could collect to oppose us carry him off '| i talked the matter over with captain longswill and dissuaded him from following the plan he proposed feeling sure that it would be much safer for you to try and effect your escape as before intended | two roses gathered at the same time from the same tree were put into separate glasses of water | the stalk of one of these roses was burnt according to prescription they were left a night in water and the next day the rose that had been burnt appeared in much better health than that which had not been burnt | the experiment was afterwards several times repeated and should be tried by others until the fact be fully ascertained |  july 1797 | little w three years old was shown miss b 's beautiful copy of the aurora surgens of guido | the car of apollo is encircled by the dancing hours so that its shape is not seen part of one wheel only is visible between the robes of the dancing figures | we asked little w why that man pointing to the figure of apollo in his invisible car looked so much higher up in the air than the other people |w   because he is in a carriage he is sitting in a carriage | we pointed to the imperfect wheel and asked if he knew what that was | he immediately answered yes the wheel of the carriage | we wanted to see whether the imagination of a child of three years old would supply the invisible parts of the car: and whether the wheel and horses and man holding the reins would suggest the idea of a ph ton |  v chapter on taste and imagination | we shall not trespass upon the reader's patience with any more anecdotes from the nursery | we hope that candid and intelligent parents will pardon if they have discovered any desire in us to exhibit our pupils | we may mistake our own motives and we do not pretend to be perfectly impartial judges upon this occasion but we have hoped that only such conversations or anecdotes have been produced as may be of some use in practical education | from conversation if properly managed children may learn with ease expedition and delight a variety of knowledge and a skilful preceptor can apply in conversation all the principles that we have laboriously endeavoured to make intelligible | if your general chooses to shoot or strangle him that is no affair of mine though i should be sorry to see so fine a youth put to death | saying this the doctor walked out and the jailer closed the door behind him | i wished after what i had heard that i had arranged to try and escape that very night and i determined that the next time the doctor came we should fix the time for making the attempt | as soon as it was dark i set to work on the bar and managed to get it completely out of its socket so that i could move it in a moment without making any noise | i then put my bed to rights and getting in went to sleep | so sound were my slumbers i did not awake till i found the jailer leaning over me and shaking me by the shoulders | i looked up and asked him what was the matter |  only that i have come to tell you that you are to be put to death to morrow which is a very unpleasant announcement he answered |  however the commandant being a religious man will send a padre to you that you may confess to him and prepare yourself for your inevitable fate |  am i to be shot | i asked in a tone as full of alarm as i could assume |  no he answered |  a new machine has just arrived from spain called a garotte | from what i hear it is a very clever invention | you will only have to sit down in a chair which has a hollow in the back and a piece of wood which is also hollowed out comes in front then by turning a large screw the two are pressed together till the windpipe is stopped up | in consequence you will cease to breathe but do not be alarmed you will find it very easy if not agreeable | you will afterwards be cut up and the portions of your body will be exposed in various parts of the town to show our brave soldiers how traitors are treated but that will be a matter of indifference to you i suppose | i only mention it that you may give a full description to your friends of what is to happen to whom i would advise you to write during the day | you will be furnished with paper and ink for the purpose | in the meantime the padre will visit you and you will be wise to make a clean breast to him | the man spoke with a sardonic grin on his countenance which would have been very trying had i not fully expected to disappoint him | leaving me an ample supply of provisions he went away chuckling at my fancied alarm | as soon as he closed the door i got up and made a capital breakfast and then prepared to receive the padre whenever he should come | my chief fear was that the doctor might not be allowed again to visit me and that i should lose the opportunity of fixing a time with captain longswill for making my escape | i did not wish to offend the padre at the same time i determined not to make a confession of any sort to him | he might prove a kind hearted man and if so i would spend the time of his visit in trying to get him to intercede for me | i had just finished my meal when a friar with a cowl over his head entered the cell |  i can give you half an hour senor padre | that will be long enough to shrive the young englishman observed the jailer as he closed the door |  you are in a bad case my son i fear said the monk as he approached me | i knew the voice though the cowl in the gloom of the cell prevented me from seeing my visitor's features |  what padre pacheco | i exclaimed |  my dear padre | how could you have risked your safety by coming here |  for your sake barry i would go through much greater danger he answered |  i followed you to this place being resolved to attempt your liberation and i have heard all about you from our friend the doctor | it being reported that you and others are to be put to death to morrow on finding that he would not be allowed to visit you again i boldly came to the prison letting the jailer suppose that the commandant had sent for me to shrive you | he at once admitted me and here i am to tell you that your friend the english captain will send a boat in to night at eleven o'clock when all the garrison with the exception of the guards will be asleep | the doctor will come to visit his patients late in the day and will then find out who is to be on guard and will do his best to give them sleeping potions so that you may boldly pass between them and scramble over the wall | i do not therefore consider that you will have to run any great risk | the padre talked on in a low voice | when i expressed my fears that he would compromise his own safety he answered that as soon as he knew that i had escaped he intended to get away if possible on board the flying fish and that he had engaged a boat to take him off | this much relieved my mind | we were still conversing when we heard the jailer turn the key in the lock | on this the padre got up and went towards the door |  he has made as good a confession as i could have expected he observed to the jailer as he went out i hope my friend you will be as prepared to die when your time comes as he is | i was after this left alone for the greater part of the day and towards evening the jailer brought me some more food | i was very thankful to see his back as he went out and heartily trusted that i might never set eyes on him again | i could only calculate the time by hearing the guards changed | at last believing that it was nearly eleven o'clock i prepared for my adventure | putting up my bedstead as before i climbed to the window from which i noiselessly removed the bar then getting outside i replaced it and dropped a height of ten feet or so into a sort of inner ditch | it was perfectly dry and as the ground was hard i felt somewhat shaken but recovering myself i crawled along till i could mount the bank at a spot whence i could observe the sentries on either side | one as he did not move had as i hoped taken the doctor's potion but the other still walked backwards and forwards evidently wide awake | at last he sat down and as i watched him i saw that he was overcome with drowsiness | i at once crept across the intervening space and gained the top of the wall without being seen | glancing downwards the height appeared considerable but hesitation might prove my destruction so throwing myself over i dropped a height of not much under thirty feet happily alighting on the soft sand which the doctor had told me of | i had still some distance to run along the beach: on i went hoping that the two sentries would not awake till i had gained the shelter of some rocks | i then stopped an instant to ascertain whether i was taking the right direction | there was sufficient light to enable me to discern the point where the boat was to meet me | no noises proceeded from the fort | i made my way among the rocks with caution to avoid the risk of slipping down and hurting myself and at length to my infinite satisfaction i heard captain longswill's voice |  all right barry he said we are here | give me your hand and i will show you the boat | never did i more thankfully grasp a man's hand and in a few seconds i was seated in the stern sheets of his boat and we were pulling off for the flying fish which lay in the offing | i told the captain of my anxiety about the doctor and padre pacheco |  they will be all right he answered i promised to burn a blue light as soon as you were safe on board when they were immediately to shove off | it may puzzle the spaniards somewhat to know what it means but as they are not fond of turning out of their beds we shall be away long before they come to look after us | the schooner was under way standing on and off shore when we got on board | we afterwards ran in closer and to my great joy made out a boat pulling towards us out of which presently stepped the doctor and the padre | the boat then pulled away and we ran to the northward so that we might be out of sight of land before the morning | i asked the captain where he was going |  i have received directions to proceed up the orinoco to angostura he answered |  as that city is in the hands of your friends i conclude that you would wish to go there | if not i will keep you on board and land you at jamaica or any other english island where you may desire to remain |  by all means let me go on shore at angostura i said for i am as anxious as ever to help to drive the spaniards out of the country | the doctor and the padre were greatly pleased when they found that the schooner was about to proceed up the orinoco |  i shall thus be able to recover my chests observed the former it would have broken my heart to leave them | i shall also i hope be able to remain till i see the patriotic cause triumphant and you barry settled happily at home | you make a very good soldier but you are cut out for something better than shooting your fellow creatures and running the risk of being shot in return |  and i shall be able to get back to my people and i hope have liberty to preach the gospel to them in quiet observed the padre | we were soon out of the caribbean sea when the wind shifting to the north east we ran along the eastern shore of the beautiful island of trinidad | the yellow water amid which we afterwards sailed showed us that we were off the mouth of the mighty orinoco | the shores on both sides of the river were so low that we could see only the mangrove bushes rising out of the water with tall trees farther off | having taken a pilot on board and the wind being from the eastward we sailed rapidly up the stream notwithstanding the strong current running against us | the river being in the hands of the patriots who commanded it with strong flotillas of flecheras or gun boats we sailed on without molestation from the spaniards and at last after a voyage of ten days or more reached angostura | hearing that general bolivar had already left the place with his forces and was marching towards the plains of apure my friends and i determined to follow him | finding that we could perform two or three hundred miles or so of the distance by water we engaged a canoe to take us up | when bidding farewell to my friend captain longswill he put a purse into my hand observing you are in want of funds and you or your uncle can repay me some day if you have the opportunity | if not you are welcome to the money i have made a successful voyage and can spare it | i thanked him much for his generosity for i was unwilling to be indebted either to the doctor or the padre who would however i am sure have been ready to help me | i was thus able to purchase a rifle and other weapons | the doctor had preserved his and the padre supplied himself with arms at the same time | we set off towards the middle of the day and had thus made some progress before sunset | our life was very similar to that which we led when coming up the magdalena | we landed at night on the shore where we built some huts for shelter lighted a fire cooked our provisions and then lay down to rest | i was on foot before my companions the next morning and rambling gun in hand along the bank of a small stream which ran into the main river was much struck with the calm beauty of the scene so different from anything i had witnessed for many months | the vegetation was rich in the extreme creepers with gay colours hanging from all the branches with graceful reed like plants springing up at the water's edge while on the surface floated large green leaves on which i saw a long footed jacana standing while engaged in fishing for her breakfast | the idea came across my mind how much happier it would be to live amid scenes like this instead of having to go back to the wild turmoil of the camp or engage in the heady fight but while my country remained enslaved it was my duty to risk life and limb and to sacrifice everything else to set her free so i quickly banished the thought and hastened back to my friends | having breakfasted we proceeded on our voyage | our canoe was a curious craft: she was formed of a single vast trunk hollowed out by fire and the axe forty feet in length and scarcely more than three in beam with upper works added to her and on the after part was a platform projecting over the sides on which was erected a small low cabin or toldo | the deck if i may so term it was covered with jaguar skins on which we could stretch ourselves when we wished to escape from the heat of the sun | a dozen indian rowers sat two and two in the fore part with paddles three feet long in the form of spoons and they kept very regular stroke by singing songs which were of a somewhat sad and monotonous character | our craft was so crank that one of us could not venture to lean over on one side unless we gave notice to balance the boat by inclining on the other | still we made very good progress considering the current that was against us | during the excessive heat of the day we landed to allow the crew to take some rest | the doctor on these occasions bade me remark the silence which reigned over nature | the beasts of the forest had retired to the thickets the birds had hidden themselves beneath the foliage of the trees | we landed one night on a sand bank when finding no tree we stuck some long poles in the ground to which we fastened our hammocks with blazing fires around | it was a beautiful moonlight night calm and serene | we observed numerous alligators with their heads above the surface others were stretched along the opposite shore with their eyes turned towards the fire which seemed to attract them as it does fish and other inhabitants of the water | the first part of the evening passed away quietly enough but an hour before midnight so terrific a noise arose in the neighbouring forest that we in vain tried to sleep | it appeared as if all the wild beasts of the continent had collected together in an endeavour to out howl each other | we could not distinguish one from the other but the indians by listening attentively caught the voices of those which sounded for an instant at intervals while the rest ceased | among the strange cries were those of the sapajous the moans of the alouati monkeys the howlings of jaguars and pumas the shrieks and grunts of peccaries the calls of the curassow the paraka and other fowls | jumbo added his voice to the turmoil barking furiously but suddenly he ceased then again began to howl and tried to jump into his master's hammock |  he knows that a jaguar is approaching observed the doctor |  i only hope that the brute will show his ugly nose here |  take care that he does not leap into your hammock i remarked |  not while i keep my weather eye open observed the doctor | as a precautionary measure however the doctor got out of his hammock and piled wood on all the fires | these i suppose kept the jaguars from actually attacking us but the next morning we found the traces of several which had come down to the river to drink | continuing our voyage the men after having paddled against a strong current begged for a noonday rest which we were compelled to allow them | the forest appeared tolerably open so the doctor proposed that we should take our guns and shoot any animals we might come across | the padre he and i accordingly landed and observing that the ground rose to some height inland we pushed forward in that direction | in addition to my gun i had armed myself with a long spear a useful weapon under most circumstances in that region although it could not be employed to much effect in a thick forest | we shot a paca and several birds and had got some way up the hill which was densely covered with trees to the summit when the doctor suggested that it was time to return |  gladly my friends answered the padre hill climbing does not quite suit me unless on the back of a stout mule and i am besides very hungry | i hope our people will have prepared dinner for us |hark  what is that noise | we listened and could distinguish a confused sound of grunting and squeaking coming from a distance amid the trees | the first british edition was undertaken by mr james hogg of edinburgh in 1853 with the co operation of the author and under his direction the final volume of this edition was not issued until the year following de quincey's death | in the autumn of 1859 the frail physique of the now famous opium eater grew gradually feeble although suffering from no definite disease | it became evident that his life was drawing to its end | on december 8 his two daughters standing by his side he fell into a doze | his mind had been wandering amid the scenes of his childhood and his last utterance was the cry sister sister sister | as if in recognition of one awaiting him one who had been often in his dreams the beloved elizabeth whose death had made so profound and lasting an impression on his imagination as a child |  the authoritative edition of de quincey's works is that edited by david masson and published in fourteen volumes by adam and charles black edinburgh | for american students the riverside edition in twelve volumes houghton mifflin co boston will be found convenient | the most satisfactory life of de quincey is the one by masson in the english men of letters series | of a more anecdotal type are the life of de quincey by h a | page whose real name is alexander h japp 2 vols new york 1877 and de quincey memorials new york 1891 by the same author | very interesting is the brief volume recollections of thomas de quincey by john r findlay edinburgh 1886 who also contributes the paper on de quincey to the encyclop dia britannica | de quincey and his friends by james hogg london 1895 is another volume of recollections souvenirs and anecdotes which help to make real their subject's personality | besides the editor other writers contribute to this volume: richard woodhouse john r findlay and john hill burton who has given under the name papaverius a picturesque description of the opium eater | the student should always remember that de quincey's own chapters in the autobiographic sketches and the confessions of an english opium eater which are among the most charming and important of his writings are also the most authoritative and most valuable sources of our information concerning him | in reading about de quincey do not fail to read de quincey himself | the best criticism of the opium eater's work is found in william minto's manual of english prose literature ginn co | a shorter essay is contained in saintsbury's history of nineteenth century literature | a very valuable list of all de quincey's writings in chronological order is given by fred n

articles are full of brain from beginning to end | at the rate of about half a volume a day they would serve for a month's reading and a month continuously might be worse expended | there are few courses of reading from which a young man of good natural intelligence would come away more instructed charmed and stimulated or to express the matter as definitely as possible with his mind more stretched | good natural intelligence a certain fineness of fibre and some amount of scholarly education have to be presupposed indeed in all readers of de quincey | but even for the fittest readers a month's complete and continuous course of de quincey would be too much | better have him on the shelf and take down a volume at intervals for one or two of the articles to which there may be an immediate attraction | it would not do to expend these as on our way back we might have to defend ourselves against other wild beasts | the doctor now took my lance which he used with pretty good effect piercing five or six more of our enemies | he had pinned another to the ground through the side but in its struggles it snapped off the head of the lance and we had now only the charges which i had reserved for the destruction of some of the remainder | each time i fired i killed a peccary but we calculated that when i had fired the last shot i could venture on there would still remain upwards of forty of our fierce little assailants a number sufficient to kill every one of us should we descend to the ground | we sat still for some minutes considering what was best to be done | hunger independent of the wish to continue our voyage made us anxious to get down but the doctor warned the padre and me on no account to make the attempt |  i would sooner face a couple of jaguars than those little brutes he observed | we were seated on our perches disconsolate enough it may be supposed when we heard a sound of cracking boughs as if some creature was making its way through the underwood and presently we caught sight of a large tapir with a jaguar on its back dashing at headlong speed through the forest | it attracted the attention of the peccaries and they for the moment forgetting us darted off in pursuit possibly with the hope of making both animals their prey |  now's our time cried the doctor come senor padre descend from your tree quick quick and we'll make our way to the canoe | the padre eagerly obeyed the summons and came rolling rather than leaping down to the ground nearly dislocating his ankle | we each of us took hold of his hands and together in spite of the pain he was suffering ran through the forest | as we did so i looked back pretty often to ascertain whether the terrible little monsters were following us | the padre begged us at last to stop that he might recover breath and rub his ankle | as we rested he fancied that he again heard the grunts and squeaks and urged us to go on | we willingly obeyed him and continued our night till we saw the broad river close in front of us | we shouted to our crew but neither they nor the canoe were to be seen |  the fellows can't have put off already exclaimed the doctor they deserve hanging or shooting if they have |  perhaps they are hidden by the bank observed the padre come on | i still hear those horrible grunts in the distance i shall never get the sound out of my ears as long as i live | presently we saw a hat rising above the bank it was that of our captain | another and another appeared | the fellows had been fast asleep and had not discovered now quickly the time had gone by | when they heard of our encounter they congratulated us assuring us that they had known of numbers of people being killed by herds of peccaries and they asserted that the creatures will attack and destroy a jaguar though many of the herd may first lose their lives in the battle | our men on hearing of the peccaries we had killed were eager to obtain some of the flesh and coolly asked us to go with them that we might defend them | this we declined doing for even a dozen men would have been no match for the remainder of the herd should we encounter them | our fellows looked very sulky at our refusal though they were afraid to go alone so we ordered them to shove off and proceeded on our voyage leaving the slain peccaries to become the food of jaguars and pumas or armadilloes and vultures which before the nest day's sun arose would devour the whole of them | some days after this we reached a long low sand bank which the falling waters had left dry | we were about to pass close to it when a voice from the shore hailed us to keep off in the middle of the stream and on looking in the direction from whence it came we perceived a large encampment of indians and in the midst of them recognised a franciscan monk | to recompense our crew for the loss of the peccaries we agreed to land in the hope of obtaining some fresh provisions | padre pacheco told us not to mention who he was and certainly no one could have discovered him by his dress | on landing we were welcomed by the friar who introduced himself as padre bobo | he had come with his people from some place in the interior to the harvest of eggs | the turtles he said had already begun laying them and his people proposed digging them up the following morning when they would supply us with as many as we required | we accordingly agreed to remain till then | the padre seemed a jovial old gentleman though he complained of his solitary life | he had got his indians under tolerable subjection but he appeared to me to have advanced them very slightly in the scale of civilisation while their religion consisted chiefly in crossing themselves and bowing to the crucifix which he held up when he performed mass | however as padre pacheco observed they had given up some of their worst customs and that was something | padre bobo gave us much information about the habits of these turtles | they invariably lay their eggs during the night | in the evening they may be seen with their heads above water eager for the moment of the sun's setting then directly it is dark they land and commence operations | the animal first digs a hole three feet in diameter and four in depth with its hind feet which are very long and furnished with crooked claws | so anxious is it to lay its eggs that it often descends into a hole that has been dug by another still uncovered with sand where it deposits a new layer of eggs on that which has been recently laid | numbers of eggs are thus broken | all night long they continue working on the beach and daylight often surprises many of them before the laying of their eggs is terminated | they now labour with double eagerness having not only to deposit their eggs but to close the holes they have dug that they may not be perceived by the jaguars which are sure to be waiting in the neighbourhood and many on these occasions are captured | the padre gave us an ample supper consisting of turtle dressed in a variety of ways and several wild fruits washed down with some of the doctor's aguadiente which had been brought up from the canoe | he then produced a bundle of tobacco with some long pipes for those who smoked after which he brought out an exceedingly greasy pack of cards and invited us to join him in a game observing that he was rarely visited by white gentlemen with whom he could enjoy that pleasure | as i nearly fell asleep during the game i have not the slightest recollection of what it was indeed having a dislike to cards i was utterly ignorant how the game was played | we then turned into our hammocks slung between the trees and slept soundly without fear of interruption for the indians kept unusually quiet lest they should alarm the turtles while they were also on the watch to guard against a surprise from jaguars | at daybreak the next morning we went out with padre bobo and his chief man who carried a long pole with which to search for the eggs | digging it into the sand as he went along he discovered each nest by finding no opposition to the pole as he struck it downwards generally to about the depth of three or four feet | the indians then followed and removing the sand with their hands placed the eggs they collected in small baskets in which they carried them to their encampment and threw them into long wooden troughs filled with water | in these troughs the eggs broken and stirred with shovels remained exposed to the sun till the oily part rose to the surface | as fast as this oil collected it was skimmed off and boiled over a quick fire | the indians called it turtle butter and the padre told us that it keeps better than olive or any other oil | when well prepared it is limpid inodorous and almost white and can then be used not only for burning in lamps but also for cooking | notwithstanding the vast quantity of eggs laid in consequence of the persecution to which the poor turtles are exposed their numbers have decreased of late years | the jaguars are their most inveterate enemies next to man they pounce upon them and turn one after the other on their backs so that they may afterwards devour them at their ease | from the suppleness of the jaguar's paw it is able to remove the double armour of the creature and to scrape out the flesh with the greatest neatness | it will even pursue the turtle into the water when not very deep | it also digs up its eggs and together with the alligator the heron and the gallinazo vulture captures large numbers of the little turtles recently hatched | our crew half filled the boat with small live turtles and eggs dried in the sun | the alligators which are among the principal persecutors of the turtles find their own young attacked by vultures | we at length reached the mouth of the apure and having happily escaped an overturn of our crank craft we landed at a large village | here obtaining horses we pushed forward towards the camp of the republicans where i hoped to rejoin my brave commander general bermudez | chapter ten | journey to the camp sleep at a cattle farm obtain a guide mode of catching electric eels reach the camp our life in camp carne con cuero the doctor and the wild boar alarming news about norah march on carabobo intelligence from norah important information given by the messenger the defile cleared we pass through it battle of carabobo the padre does his part horrible slaughter gallantry of a spanish officer death of colonel acosta glorious result of the battle we set off in search of norah meet her attended by kanimapo fierce skirmish aqualonga captured norah's adventures continue our march to don fernando's another adventure meet with our friends arrival grief for the death of colonel acosta aqualonga shot further campaigning return friendly meeting with kanimapo's tribe happy marriages conclusion | after passing through a thickly wooded region bordering the banks of the river we emerged on an open country the celebrated llanos of venezuela which extended far away beyond human ken | as the best part of the day was spent we agreed that it would be folly to attempt pushing forward without a guide so as a hato or cattle farm was seen in the distance we resolved to ride towards it for the purpose of obtaining one | with the exception of the rich grass which covered the surface of the ground the only vegetation visible consisted of a few clumps of palm trees with fan like leaves scattered here and there over the wide expanse | the farm buildings consisted of palm thatched huts surrounded by a fence of palm trunks beyond which were the corrals or cattle enclosures | countless herds dotted the plain even to the horizon | on reaching the gate the overseer a fine looking elderly negro came out and inquired our business | on hearing who we were he invited us in promising to supply all our wants | he had not much to offer in the way of accommodation but such as it was he gladly put it at our disposal | such luxuries as beds did not exist but a long table and benches and chairs were found in the principal hut also an ample supply of beef which an old negress immediately began to prepare for us | suffice it to say that we had a substantial supper and could sleep secure from the attacks of foes | the next morning our breakfast having been a repetition of the evening meal we prepared to start the overseer having selected a trusty llanero as our guide | it was difficult to say to what race he belonged | he called himself a white but his complexion and features betokened indian and african progenitors | he was a fine athletic looking fellow lithe yet muscular and evidently capable of enduring continued and violent exercise without fatigue | a broad brimmed hat a shirt and trousers and a coloured poncho over his shoulders completed his attire his weapons being a long lance and a large mouthed blunderbuss | of his steed which he had caught and broken in himself he was excessively proud and he boasted that mounted on its back there was not a bull on the plains however fierce which he could not overtake and capture with his lasso | he would conduct us without fail to the camp though streams and marshes intervened over a wide extent of the llanos | we set off therefore without anxiety either keeping alongside our guide or following close at his heels now galloping along the borders of a marsh now plunging through places where i should have expected to be smothered had i not trusted to his experience to lead the way | i am afraid to say how many miles we covered without pulling rein | our hardy steeds requiring no food till the end of the day's journey we only stopped for a few minutes by the side of a pool to allow them to drink and then went on again | towards nightfall we arrived at another farm very similar to the one we had left | the padre complained much of the fatigue of riding at a rate to which he had been so long unaccustomed | even the doctor declared that he had no wish to travel the same distance another day | our guide laughed at their complaints observing that they were welcome to rest as long as they liked | he looked with more respect at me as i had endured the fatigue better than my companions | during the evening he told me that some of the men at the farm were going out next morning to catch fish and should i wish it i might accompany them as they would return before the time we had fixed for setting out | i gladly accepted the offer as did the doctor who was curious to see the mode of fishing adopted by those sons of the desert | we accordingly rode forth with our llanero pablo as guide the servants having set out some time before | we overtook them just as they had arrived at a large pond or lake rather surrounded by reeds with a few trees scattered here and there in the neighbourhood | they had driven before them a small herd of horses and mules many of which appeared to be broken down animals such as i should not have supposed were to be found on the llanos | as we approached the pond we saw several heads resembling those of large serpents just lifted above the surface and now and then i caught sight of a huge thick bodied snake like creature gliding through the water seven or eight feet in length |  what are they | i asked of pablo |  the fish we are going to catch he answered |  fish my friend they really are observed the doctor though known as gymnoti or electric eels and truly glad i am that i came to see them caught | the men were armed with harpoons and long slender rods | they now collected the horses and mules and with loud shouts drove them into the lake | the combined effect of the horses' hoofs and the men's shrieks was that numbers of the hideous looking gymnoti issued from the mud in which they lay hid and came to the surface of the water when they simultaneously made a dash at the unfortunate animals swimming and floundering about | the scene was a most extraordinary one | several of the horses being struck by these electric eels succumbed to the violence of the invisible strokes which they were receiving from all sides and disappeared beneath the water others with manes erect and eyeballs wild with pain strove to escape from their enemies but were driven back again by the indians with their long rods while several of the gymnoti approaching the shore were harpooned and dragged to land | the livid yellow eels like great water snakes swam after the unfortunate horses which were attempting to make their way to the opposite shore | but in a short time i observed that the animals appeared less alarmed they no longer erected their manes while their eyes expressed less pain and terror | the eels at the same time instead of following them swam slowly towards the shore when they like those first caught were harpooned and by a line fastened to the weapon jerked on to the bank | the doctor observed that they had lost much of their electric force also that the natives took care that the lines should not get wet | i wished to try my hand in catching one of the creatures but they warned me that should i allow the line to touch the water i would feel a shock which would well nigh knock me down | the doctor then invited some of the men to join hands which he and i did with several of them then touching one of the eels with the point of his long knife a shock passed through the whole of us which made the natives jump and shriek out one or two of them falling to the ground overcome with astonishment at the unexpected sensation rather than by the force of the shock | hideous as the creatures are the natives declared that they were very good for food and a number of them were packed up and carried back to the farm | so powerful is the electric force possessed by the eels that several of the horses were killed immediately and our companions assured us that the strongest man if struck by one of them when crossing a river would become so benumbed that he would certainly lose his life | the doctor told me how the employment of their electric powers is spontaneous and this exhausts the nervous energy so that they need repose and an abundance of nourishment before a fresh accumulation of electricity is produced | these curious creatures have the power of making holes for themselves in the marshes and mud of watercourses which remain filled with moisture during the rainy season and they are thus able to support existence in their usual localities until the return of rain when they come forth and prey upon all living animals within their reach | it took us several days after this to reach the camp | i was warmly greeted by my gallant chief who heartily congratulated me on having escaped the dangers to which i had been exposed | my companions also had a kindly welcome |  though we have been inactive for some time we shall soon have work for all of you he remarked laughing: you barry to take a part in the fighting you senor doctor to attend the wounded and you senor padre to shrive the dying | each man to his trade though to confess the truth i shall be very glad when our part of the business is over and we have driven the gothos into the sea | that i feel confident will be before long | i had received no intelligence from my family since the doctor joined me and i was becoming very anxious to hear from them | at that time it will be remembered norah was setting out to visit our relative don fernando so i eagerly sought out my cousin don carlos fully expecting that he would have heard of her arrival | greatly to my disappointment he told me that one letter alone had reached him in which it was mentioned that norah was expected but that some time had passed since they hoped to see her and that she had not arrived | on talking over the matter and comparing notes we both became greatly alarmed for her safety | i was sure from what the doctor had told me that she fully intended to go at the time he spoke of and ought to have arrived before the date of this letter | don carlos told me that on one important account his family hoped that norah would not have set out: the guahibos gained over as they believed by spanish emissaries had become more than ever threatening in their conduct | their chief and some of the principal men who were supposed to be friendly to the patriots were absent and the rest were thus left to their own devices | they were not likely to make any hostile movement without their regular leaders but should these return and prove unable to restrain them or be themselves gained over by the spaniards serious consequences might ensue | had we not expected shortly to encounter the enemy we would both have obtained leave to return home and ascertain the truth but under the circumstances this was impossible and we had therefore to restrain our impatience and hope for the best | don carlos became very unhappy and a high sense of duty alone prevented him from asking permission to quit the army for a short period | we in vain endeavoured to find a trusty messenger who would convey letters to our friends and return with an answer those we sent by the couriers who had a circuitous route to take might not reach their destination for a long time and answers would be equally tardy in their transit | as it was not in my nature to look on the dark side of things i quickly recovered my spirits trusting that all would turn out right | when i told the padre what we had heard he promised that on his return home he would visit the guahibos and try to win them over |  i have before paid them a visit when they received me in a friendly way he observed |  i know how to treat them and though they are still heathens they look upon me with respect and may listen to what i say however little inclined they are to renounce their idolatrous practices | i might give a graphic description of our life in the camp | our time however was too much taken up with amusements the discipline and organisation of the troops being but little attended to | we had shooting and hunting excursions nearly every day | if we could not obtain smaller game the llaneros with their lassos or bolas quickly captured as many head of cattle as they required | the chase of a wild bull afforded indeed excellent sport though it was not without its dangers for the savage animal irritated by its pursuers would often turn and attempt to gore them with its horns | these however the llaneros dexterously avoided and throwing the lasso over the animal's head brought it with a violent jerk to the ground when a thrust of the lance quickly finished its career | to give an idea of the rough style in which we lived i may describe the mode of cooking the beef thus killed | a joint was selected which may be termed the saddle it being formed of the two rumps which are never divided | the hide was not stripped off but the hair was singed by the application of a burning brand which rendered the skin hard and nearly impenetrable | several of these joints were placed in a large hole dug in the ground about five feet deep and of a length and breadth in proportion to the quantity of meat to be dressed | the inside of the hole having been previously lined with flat stones and a brisk fire maintained in it till it had become sufficiently hot the ashes were then raked out and the meat was placed with the hide downwards on sticks fastened from side to side horizontally and the hole being covered over with large stones to exclude the air it was thus baked | the hide was drawn by the heat from the centre of the meat but the sides being bent up the juices were preserved and the use of dishes rendered unnecessary | joints thus prepared are termed carne con cuero | another dish on which we regaled ourselves was a sheep or goat with the skin left on as in the way i have described and with the inside filled with turkeys fowls ducks wild geese pieces of pork plantains yams calvanasses cassava bread powdered boiled maize oranges lemons and such other ingredients as could be obtained the whole being cut up into small pieces and duly seasoned | the animal thus stuffed is skewered together and baked in the same manner as the beef | when the cook considered that the viands were sufficiently dressed a trumpeter proclaimed the important fact to the officers who immediately ranged themselves in a ring to enjoy the repast | one of the men acting as waiter used to stick his lance into the meat and thus conveyed it to our chief who helped himself after which it went the rounds on the point of the lance to the rest of us | the doctor's office was a sinecure so long as no fighting was going forward as the hardy llaneros were seldom sick or preferred their own remedies to those he could administer | he accordingly generally joined in our hunting expeditions | i can fancy i see him now a large handkerchief bound round his hat and fluttering in the breeze as lance in hand he one day came on a herd of wild hogs and set off after them with a shout which had often echoed in his younger days amid the forests of his fatherland | the animal he had singled out took to flight and showing good bottom led him a long chase amid the tangled brushwood till finding that running would not avail it the creature turned at bay and with its sharp tusks made a rush at the legs of the doctor's steed | the animal at that moment gave an unexpected hound and the doctor was thrown ignominiously to the ground happily on the opposite side to that on which stood the enraged boar | we saw the accident but were too far off to render him assistance before the boar could reach him | springing up however and shortening his lance of which he had not let go he stood ready to receive the savage animal and loud shouts of applause burst from the throats of our men as he was seen to plunge his spear into the body of the boar |  carne con cuero | he shouted out we'll have this fellow baked in his skin and i'll eat him in revenge for the fall he has given me | the doctor's steed being caught he remounted and the llaneros carrying the hog in front of him with several others which had been killed we returned to the camp | it was one of the last days we spent there | on arriving at the camp don carlos met me and i saw by his countenance that he was much agitated | he put into my hand a letter from my father |  it will give you terrible news i fear he said as mine did to me | your sister never reached our house though she undoubtedly left her home about the time you expected she would do | don fernando after waiting for some time and not seeing her sent to your father to ascertain if she was coming and received the intelligence that she had already set off | it was at first hoped that she might have gone to castle concannan but though she called there to pay a visit to our aunts she again left it and after that no traces of her or her attendants could be discovered | oh what can have happened to her | cannot you suggest anything to relieve the anguish of my mind |  i will see what my father says i answered but alas | his letter only confirmed the account don carlos had given me | we then told my elder cousin of the alarming intelligence we had received but he could afford no hope: broken hearted himself he could only fancy that some dreadful fate had overtaken my young sister | we had no time however to dwell on our anxiety for news was received that the spanish generals morales and la torre had concentrated their forces on the plains of carabobo and in a council of war it was decided that they should be immediately followed and attacked | marching at a speed which hardy troops such as ours alone could have accomplished late at night we reached the foot of a range of hills lying between us and the spanish army which amounted to above seven thousand men while our forces numbered little more than five thousand | we had a british legion commanded by the gallant colonel mcintosh and our llaneros we flattered ourselves counted for something | the intervening ground consisted of rocky hills densely covered with trees through which one narrow path alone was known as leading to the plains of carabobo | the enemy having obtained notice of our approach had our spies informed us so placed their artillery as completely to command it | i was seated in the evening round the camp fire with don carlos his brother the doctor the padre and several of my brother officers when i saw an indian approaching | at first i thought he was one of those who had accompanied the army as guides across the plain but as he made his way directly up to me i recognised him by his appearance as belonging to the tribe of our friend kanimapo |  i would speak to you senor barry he said for i know you though you may not recollect me | i bring you a written message here it is and he put a paper into my hand | kneeling down i read it eagerly by the light of the fire | it was written hurriedly in pencil and signed norah |  i have been captured by aqualonga's band and he himself is with them i have twice seen him though he has not visited me | i am treated with respect but compelled to travel wherever they go | their object is i believe to obtain a ransom | i asked them to send to my father they replied that senor desmond was ruined and could not pay the sum they require | i suspect therefore that they intend to deliver me up to the spaniards | they will hold me as a hostage for you and carlos whom they know to be serving with the patriots | you will i am sure try and arrange some plan to rescue me | the bearer who is attached to his chief will inform him how i am situated and he also will endeavour i think to help me | aqualonga is marching to join the spaniards and from the intelligence i can gain i believe that we are not far off from where you are | whatever plan you propose should be carried out speedily | consult carlos | i instantly called my cousin aside and read the contents to him | on hearing the message he was even more agitated and anxious than i had been | we then called up the indian and questioned him | he had found his chief he said and faithfully delivered the message entrusted to him | kanimapo had he added bidden him hasten on to me saying that he himself would risk everything to rescue my sister |  this will make me doubly anxious to defeat the spaniards observed don carlos after he had somewhat recovered from the agitation into which this intelligence had thrown him | we both promised the indian a reward for his faithfulness in delivering the message |  i require none he answered my desire is to obey the wishes of my chief | he then inquired whether we expected soon to be engaged with the enemy of whose position he was well aware |  why do you wish to know | i asked |  because i am acquainted with a defile through these hills of which perhaps your leaders are ignorant he replied |  it is thickly overgrown with brushwood and trees so as to be completely concealed from view but if these impediments were cleared away you might descend suddenly on the enemy and take them by surprise | it was here that my people once fought a fierce battle with the castilians and though ages have since passed away the memory of it still survives among us | carlos and i were fully satisfied after further conversation with the indian that the account he gave us was correct the more so as he undertook to lead us to the entrance of the defile | we at once set off therefore discussing as we went plans for rescuing norah in case kanimapo should not have succeeded in doing so | but even for her sake we could not leave the army till the battle was over and indeed it would have been impossible to obtain men to accompany us | quitting the camp the indian led us some way to the right of our position along the foot of the wooded hill after which he struck off directly towards it | instead of having steep rocks to climb as would have been the case in every other part except the before mentioned passage we ascended a gentle slope and then continued over tolerably level ground till we found ourselves on the top of another slope reaching down to the plain below | from the position we had gained we could distinguish between the trees the camp fires of the spanish army extending for a considerable way to our left | we at once saw the importance of this pass and hastened back to general bermudez with the information we had obtained | he had lain down to sleep but on hearing what we had to say he hurried with us to general bolivar | the commander in chief after complimenting us on the intelligence we had displayed immediately issued orders for a party of his men with their machetes and axes to proceed into the defile and clear it of wood so as to allow of the passage of cavalry | they were thus employed during the whole of the night under the command of a gallant young englishman | after a few hours' sleep by the time morning broke carlos and i were in the saddle | the blacks had nearly completed their work and the only reward the sambos asked was to be allowed to lead the assault | they were followed by the british legion under colonel mcintosh | as the last trees were cleared away their position was shown to the spaniards who opened a tremendous fire on them through which they ran down to the attack numbers falling as they advanced but nothing stopped them | the british legion six hundred strong next rushed through the defile with the steadiness for which they have been so long famed and attacked the enemy who thus taken by surprise had not time to bring their artillery to bear upon us | a smaller force of newly arrived english troops under colonel ferrier was fearfully cut to pieces their gallant commander being killed just as he had succeeded in recovering his colours taken by the spaniards | i am sorry to say that some of the llaneros under general paez unable to withstand the repeated volleys of musketry which the well formed ranks of the spaniards poured into them for a few minutes showed the white feather and began to retreat but the general after lancing a dozen or more succeeded in rallying them and leading them against the enemy | we meanwhile got through with our well trained cavalry and while the british supported by the ferocious sambos charged with the bayonet into the thickest of the spanish lines we led by bermudez sprang forward at headlong speed with lances in rest and paez and his men again attacking the remaining part of the enemy's line they now went down before us like chaff before the wind | the british legion with their black supporters had already forced the centre bayoneting hundreds of their opponents and now when paez and our party charged upon the devoted royalists horrible indeed was the destruction which overtook them | again and again we charged each time adding to the fearful slaughter | fresh troops now came pouring through the defile and cut off those portions of the spanish army which had separated from the main body invariably putting them to death | several times i got glimpses of the padre leading on a band of horsemen against the ranks of the enemy flourishing a huge sword but never once to my belief striking with it conscientiously allowing his followers to do the killing work with their lances | he seemed to bear a charmed life for though in the thickest of the fight the bullets whizzed harmlessly by him | in one hour from the time colonel mcintosh entered the plain five entire battalions of the enemy had laid down their arms whilst with one exception the survivors of the remaining regiments had taken to flight | i feel called upon to speak of the gallantry of one young spanish officer who at the head of his regiment remained on the field fighting to the last then perceiving that he had no longer a chance of contending successfully against us he moved his men off in a cool and regular manner | so struck was general paez with the bravery he displayed that he would not allow him to be attacked in his retreat | i was returning from our last charge when i saw a wounded officer whom i recognised even at a distance as one of our party | on dismounting to ascertain what assistance i could give him i found to my sorrow that it was my cousin whom i had so long known as colonel acosta | he recognised me and pressing my hand in a faint voice he asked me to take a locket from his neck | i did as he desired and holding it in his hand he gazed steadfastly at it with eyes rapidly becoming dim as the chill of death stole over him |  paola paola | i would have died to save you he murmured |  let this be buried with me he whispered |  take care of it lest any sacrilegious hands should tear it from me | i lifted him up meanwhile shouting to some of my men to try and find a surgeon in case it might not be too late to save his life | but even then his spirit was departing and ere another minute had passed i found that i held his lifeless form in my arms | ordering a party of men to carry the body to the camp i next went in search of carlos to give him the sad information and that night we buried the betrothed of the unfortunate donna paola salabriata beneath a lofty palm tree with her miniature as he had desired placed on his breast | that battle decided the fate of the spanish power in venezuela and though in some places along the sea coast isolated bands held out in the hope of receiving succour from spain ere long every spanish soldier was driven from the land and the cause of liberty triumphed | we had no difficulty in obtaining from general bermudez a strong troop of horsemen with which to proceed under the guidance of the indian in search of the band who held norah in captivity | the padre and the doctor too on hearing of our expedition insisted on accompanying us |  but i fear that you senor padre will not be able to endure the fatigues we may have to undergo i observed |  in such a cause i shall be insensible to fatigue answered the padre in a spirited tone |  perhaps too i can be of use in influencing some of the rascals who know me and may be willing to listen to what i say | go i must barry so say no more about it | the doctor was equally determined |  there are plenty of surgeons belonging to the british legion in the camp to attend to the wounded and your fair sister may be ill and require my aid he answered so i intend to form one of your party | if there is any fighting you shall see that i can wield a sword or lance as well as my reverend friend here | ah senor padre | you did wonderful execution among the enemy yesterday |  heaven forgive me for the deaths i caused | answered the padre with a sigh |  my blood was up and i fought for liberty and my country | i thought of nothing else and where the odds were so much against us i knew that no true man could be spared | carlos and i with our two stalwart friends set off without loss of time at the head of our brave llaneros | caution was necessary however | the banditti might not have heard of the defeat of the spaniards and should we discover and attack them they might retaliate on my hapless sister | we pushed forward as rapidly as we could eager to release her and as we proceeded we sent out scouts to ascertain if possible the position of aqualonga and his band of cut throats | though we took a wide range we could nowhere hear of them and were satisfied therefore that they had not passed us | night and day we were on the watch whether resting in camp or galloping forward and relying on the hardihood of our steeds we advanced at a rate that no ordinary cavalry could have done | one day about noon we reached a slight elevation of the ground scarcely to be called a hill to the top of which we rode that we might obtain a wider look out over the country ahead of us | near at hand was a stream bordered by a thick copse of a height sufficient when we dismounted to conceal us and our horses | it was a spot well suited for an ambush | scarcely had we gained the top of the hillock when we saw in the far distance what appeared to us the leading files of a party of horsemen | both the doctor and the padre declared that this must be aqualonga's party and advised that we should conceal ourselves behind the brushwood and rush out upon them as they passed by | supposing that the approaching strangers were enemies the suggestion was a good one: we therefore ordered our men to ride round the foot of the mount while we hoping that we had not been seen descended and joined them | for some time we did not regain sight of the strangers but at length we observed instead of the large body we expected to see two figures galloping across the savannah while behind them came a number of indians on foot running at headlong speed with a party of horsemen coming quickly up in the distance | as they drew nearer one appeared to be a female and from the plume of feathers in her hair the doctor declared that she must be an indian as undoubtedly from his costume was her companion |  an indian | no no | that she is not | exclaimed don carlos springing to his horse |  it is donna norah | the idea that such was the case had flashed across my mind and convinced that he was right i followed his example | in another instant breaking from our cover we were galloping across the plain towards them followed by our entire party | they saw us coming and the indian for an instant altered his course as if to avoid us but soon seeing who we were he and norah came galloping on | i then recognised our friend kanimapo though dressed as he was in all the war trappings of a chief i had certainly not known him at first | he and norah were soon in our midst | i need scarcely describe the joy of the meeting | but there was short time for exchange of greetings |  those you see are our foes from whom we have just escaped exclaimed kanimapo |  they will endeavour to recapture us but your band if you can trust your men will be sufficient to defeat them should they venture to attack you | as he spoke the men on foot who were all indians drew up on one side to allow the horsemen to advance which they did shouting loudly and flourishing their weapons | begging the padre and the doctor to guard norah carlos and i put our men in order then joined by kanimapo and with our lances couched we dashed on to meet the foe | a swarthy man of hideous aspect was at their head whom i recognised as aqualonga himself | his men wavered as they saw us coming and in vain did he endeavour to cheer them on galloping forward at headlong speed as if resolved to conquer or meet a soldier's death | some of his men inspirited by his example continued to urge on their steeds but the rear ranks panic stricken wheeled round and galloped off to save their lives | the lance of don carlos caught the guerilla chief in the shoulder and forced him from his saddle | most of those who followed him were pierced through or cut down the rest sought safety in flight leaving us masters of the field and their famed leader a prisoner in our hands | several of our men leaping to the ground bound him hand and foot and placed him on horseback but it would have been dangerous to pursue the defeated foe as we could not leave my sister without protection | having already performed nearly half the distance to don fernando's house we agreed to proceed thither it being somewhat nearer than my father's though i was anxious to inform my parents of norah's safety | but we remembered that our arrival though we should be welcomed by our friends would bring sorrow to the household | norah though pale and thin from the fatigue and alarm she had undergone soon recovered her spirits her happiness being increased by finding that don carlos had escaped the dangers to which he had been exposed albeit she was grieved at hearing of the death of his brother | she very briefly at that time narrated her adventures | after leaving castle concannan on her way to don fernando's house while she was riding on ahead a party of banditti pounced out of a wood and surrounded her and her attendants and made them all prisoners | she before long discovered that aqualonga was the leader of the party | he was she believed going to carry her off across the mountains but from some intelligence he obtained he changed his plan and proceeded across the savannah | he left her at a solitary rancho under the charge of a negress and a party of men to guard her | she received no insult but she was coarsely fed and no attention was paid to her comforts | she was however allowed to stroll about the rancho and one day to her surprise she saw an indian whom she recognised as belonging to kanimapo's tribe | she found an opportunity of communicating with him and persuaded him to inform his chief where she was | he promised to do so and to return with any message she might give him | after some time aqualonga and his band returned whereupon they set out to the north west carrying her with them so her hopes of being rescued vanished |  footnote: frequent attempts have shown that such a spiritual atmosphere can belong not only to heroes but to any human being | sensitives cannot for example remain in a room in which a person has been who is spiritually antagonistic to them even though they know nothing of his existence | the most modern musicians like debussy create a spiritual impression often taken from nature but embodied in purely musical form | for this reason debussy is often classed with the impressionist painters on the ground that he resembles these painters in using natural phenomena for the purposes of his art | whatever truth there may be in this comparison merely accentuates the fact that the various arts of today learn from each other and often resemble each other | but it would be rash to say that this definition is an exhaustive statement of debussy's significance | despite his similarity with the impressionists this musician is deeply concerned with spiritual harmony for in his works one hears the suffering and tortured nerves of the present time | and further debussy never uses the wholly material note so characteristic of programme music but trusts mainly in the creation of a more abstract impression | debussy has been greatly influenced by russian music notably by mussorgsky | so it is not surprising that he stands in close relation to the young russian composers the chief of whom is scriabin | the experience of the hearer is frequently the same during the performance of the works of these two musicians | a hut was built for norah and don carlos and i lay down outside that in case of any sudden surprise we might be at hand to protect her | the first watch of the night had passed by when a shot was heard and one of the vedettes came galloping in with the announcement that he had descried a body of men approaching the camp and that as he galloped off he had been pursued by several horsemen | we of course ordered the men to be ready to leap into their saddles for the attack which we fully expected to be made and norah's horse was brought up that she might be able to mount if necessary at a moment's notice | she took the announcement very calmly as if it was quite a matter of course | while these preparations were being made the padre rode up and offered to go forth in the direction in which the strangers had been seen and ascertain who they were |  they may be enemies but they may possibly be friends and unless we learn the truth we may be knocking our heads together before we discover it he observed |  i have had so many bullets flying about my ears of late and have got off scot free that i am not afraid of any they may fire at me | though we were unwilling to expose the padre to danger his offer was of too much value to be refused | we accordingly begged him to do as he proposed and bidding us not to be anxious about him he rode off in the direction from which the vedette had come | we waited fearing every instant to hear the sound of a shot but the silence of night remained unbroken | i had directed my men not to fire till they received my order to do so to prevent the risk of the padre being shot at on his return to the camp | some time had passed away when a horseman was seen coming over the plain and the padre's voice was heard shouting all right | they are friends and will be here anon | in another minute he had reached us |  who do you think they are | he exclaimed |  the labourers of your father and senor concannan with a number of villagers and blacks and some of my people headed by senor denis your young brother and your irish servant | they knew my voice which i took care to let them hear before i approached and i told them that i would ride back and inform you lest you should begin peppering at them as they marched here to embrace you | they have come in search of aqualonga and his band whom they had traced in this direction having ascertained that he it was who had carried off donna norah | my uncle and the whole party were thankful to have recovered her without having to fight as they had expected though gerald declared that he was sorry not to be able to break a lance in her service against the renowned tawny skinned chieftain aqualonga |  faith masther gerald it's much betther as it is observed tim as the savage might have managed to run his lance into you and miss norah depend on it is a mighty deal more pleased to have no blood spilt in her cause | we were now our two parties forming one camp capable of setting at defiance any enemies likely to approach us | the next morning we continued our journey and at length after a somewhat fatiguing march over the wide extended plain having to cross several rivers and swamps sometimes fording them and at others passing over in hide formed canoes while the horses swam behind us we reached don fernando's | our welcome was such as might have been expected: norah was received as a daughter and don carlos and i were treated as heroes and by none more so than by isabella monterola who has since to my great happiness become my wife | my cousin colonel acosta as i will still call him was truly mourned for |  poor fellow | said don fernando the loss is ours | he would never have recovered the death of donna paola | the next day the bandit chief whose safe keeping cost us much anxiety was sent off under a strong escort to popayan where he was soon after ordered to be shot | an immense crowd collected to gaze on an indian who had been the terror of the country for so many years and one man as he observed his short figure and coarse and ugly features exclaimed is that the hideous little fellow who has alarmed us so long |  yes replied aqualonga darting a fierce look at him from his black eyes in this small body is the heart of a giant | at his request he was allowed to die in his colonel's uniform and just before he was shot he declared that had he twenty lives he would have been ready to sacrifice them all for the king he served | but to return to the time i was describing | we all of us endeavoured by every means in our power to express our gratitude to kanimapo for the service he had rendered us |  i have but done my duty he answered and tried to prove that i am grateful for the kindness i received at your hands | footnotes: 113 mrs honora edgeworth daughter of edward sneyd esq | of litchfield | as this lady's name has been mentioned in a monody on the death of major andr we take this opportunity of correcting a mistake that occurs in a note to that performance |  and i my friend said the padre will accompany you | i may be able to counteract the evil effects produced on their minds by the spanish emissaries and tell them of a purer faith than any they have hitherto heard of |  and i will go also exclaimed the doctor |  i should like to study their habits and customs and i may be able by healing them of their complaints to support my friend the padre in his endeavours to enlighten the minds of the poor savages and thus show practically that our wish is to benefit them | kanimapo accordingly set off accompanied by the padre and the doctor the former having resumed his clerical robes while the latter was attended by his faithful dog jumbo | we had of course immediately on our arrival despatched a messenger to my father to announce the recovery of norah and my safety | the next day uncle denis with gerald and tim went home with their followers | after spending a few days with my friends i was compelled to conduct my llaneros back to rejoin the army |  i need not mention the other events of the campaign | at the end of a couple of months don carlos and i again got leave to return home and i accompanied him to his father's house where norah had since been staying and where the whole of my family who had been invited to pay a long visit were assembled | it was to be terminated i found by my sister's marriage | the day after our arrival had been fixed don fernando informed me for a meeting with kanimapo and his tribe which was to take place in a beautiful spot at the foot of the mountains | they set off at daybreak don fernando with his sons and grandsons habited in full spanish costume to do honour to the occasion | my father uncles and i with some others accompanied them making in all a party of about twenty | although our meeting was to be of a pacific character we went armed as usual no one moving about in that region without weapons | as we approached the spot don fernando and his immediate relatives dismounted and advanced on foot towards a circle formed by a number of arrows stuck in the ground beyond which stood kanimapo and his tribe | he approached and putting out his hand grasped that of don fernando |  my people he said have hitherto been enemies to you who desired to do them good but henceforth as the points of yonder arrows are concealed in the ground so let all enmity be buried | on this the indians waved their hands and uttered loud shouts indicative of approval of what had been said | the speech by the by was much longer than i have reported it |  821 certain arunta traditions appear to point to a time when the totem was freely eaten | the bird mates of the clans may be regarded as secondary totems perhaps a survival from a time when a clan might have more than one totem | it appeared to afford infinite satisfaction to all parties and after other speeches had been made by inferior chiefs and replied to by our friends we returned home while the indians retired to their camp | kanimapo paid us a private visit soon afterwards and assured me that the padre and the doctor had been mainly instrumental in bringing about the change of sentiment in his people | after my sister's marriage with don carlos we returned to my father's house which had been substantially rebuilt | the padre in the meantime had been engaged in further instructing the indians and in establishing a school having also procured an enlightened young creole and his wife to act as master and mistress | he had begun also to translate portions of the bible which he was convinced he said was the only book by which their heathen darkness could be dispelled | he afterwards became one of the warmest advocates for its dissemination throughout the republic where a bible society soon after that period was established and flourished | the doctor who had been adding greatly to his knowledge of the natural history of the country returned home with us and to his infinite satisfaction found his boxes uninjured | at length he departed with the fruits of his labours to his beloved fatherland | he wrote me word of his safe arrival and promised some day or other to pay us another visit | the independence of columbia being at length acknowledged by spain peace was established and those who keep free of the political disputes which have so frequently broken out impeding the moral and material progress of the country have enjoyed as we and our friends have done as much happiness as frail mortals can expect to find here below |on the cessation of hostilities i sheathed my sword which i have never since drawn and though i have given some brief descriptions of the battles and skirmishes in which i was engaged during the most eventful period of the history of venezuela i wish to impress on the minds of all the readers of my narrative that war is a terrible thing which satan for his own ends encourages but which wise men and christians especially should endeavour by every means in their power to avoid |
