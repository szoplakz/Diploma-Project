  my memories of eighty years by chauncey m depew to my wife may palmer depew this book grew from her encouragement foreword for many years my friends have insisted upon my putting in permanent form the incidents in my life which have interested them | it has been my good fortune to take part in history making meetings and to know more or less intimately people prominent in world affairs in many countries | every one so situated has a flood of recollections which pour out when occasion stirs the memory | often the listeners wish these transcribed for their own use | my classmate at yale in the class of 1856 john d champlin a man of letters and an accomplished editor rescued from my own scattered records and newspaper files material for eight volumes | my secretary has selected and compiled for publication two volumes since | these are principally speeches addresses and contributions which have appeared in public | several writers without my knowledge have selected special matter from these volumes and made books | andrew d white senator hoar and senator foraker with whom i was associated for years have published full and valuable autobiographies | i do not attempt anything so elaborate or complete | never having kept a diary i am dependent upon a good memory | i have discarded the stories which could not well be published until long after i have joined the majority | i trust and earnestly hope there is nothing in these recollections which can offend anybody | it has been my object so to picture events and narrate stories as to illumine the periods through which i have passed for eighty eight years and the people whom i have known and mightily enjoyed | c m d | contents i childhood and youth ii | in public life iii | abraham lincoln iv | general

and public banquets index not included my memories of eighty years i childhood and youth it has occurred to me that some reminiscences of a long life would be of interest to my family and friends | my memory goes back for more than eighty years | i recall distinctly when about five years old my mother took me to the school of mrs westbrook wife of the well known pastor of the dutch reformed church who had a school in her house within a few doors | the lady was a highly educated woman and her husband doctor westbrook a man of letters as well as a preacher | he specialized in ancient history and the interest he aroused in roman and greek culture and achievements has continued with me ever since | the village of peekskill at that time had between two and three thousand inhabitants | its people were nearly all revolutionary families who had settled there in colonial times | there had been very little immigration either from other states or abroad acquaintance was universal and in the activities of the churches there was general co operation among the members | church attendance was so unanimous that people young or old who failed to be in their accustomed places on sunday felt the disapproval of the community | social activities of the village were very simple but very delightful and healthful | there were no very rich nor very poor | nearly every family owned its own house or was on the way to acquire one | misfortune of any kind aroused common interest and sympathy | a helping hand of neighborliness was always extended to those in trouble or distress | peekskill was a happy community and presented conditions of life and living of common interest endeavor and sympathy not possible in these days of restless crowds and fierce competition | the peekskill academy was the dominant educational institution and drew students not only from the village but from a distance | it fitted them for college and i was a student there for about twelve years | the academy was a character making institution though it lacked the thoroughness of the new england preparatory schools | its graduates entering into the professions or business had an unusual record of success in life | i do not mean that they accumulated great fortunes but they acquired independence and were prominent and useful citizens in all localities where they settled | i graduated from the peekskill academy in 1852 | i find on the programme of the exercises of that day which some old student preserved that i was down for several original speeches while the other boys had mainly recitations | apparently my teachers had decided to develop any oratorical talent i might possess | i entered yale in 1852 and graduated in 1856 | the college of that period was very primitive compared with the university to which it has grown | our class of ninety seven was regarded as unusually large | the classics and mathematics greek and latin were the dominant features of instruction | athletics had not yet appeared though rowing and boat racing came in during my term | the outstanding feature of the institution was the literary societies: the linonia and the brothers of unity | the debates at the weekly meetings were kept up and maintained upon a high and efficient plane | both societies were practically deliberative bodies and discussed with vigor the current questions of the day | under this training yale sent out an unusual number of men who became eloquent preachers distinguished physicians and famous lawyers | while the majority of students now on leaving college enter business or professions like engineering which is allied to business at that time nearly every young man was destined for the ministry law or medicine | my own class furnished two of the nine judges of the supreme court of the united states and a large majority of those who were admitted to the bar attained judicial honors | it is a singular commentary on the education of that time that the students who won the highest honors and carried off the college prizes which could only be done by excelling in latin greek and mathematics were far outstripped in after life by their classmates who fell below their high standard of collegiate scholarship but were distinguished for an all around interest in subjects not features in the college curriculum | my classmates justice david j brewer and justice henry billings brown were both eminent members of the supreme court of the united states | brewer was distinguished for the wide range of his learning and illuminating addresses on public occasions | he was bicentennial orator of the college and a most acceptable one | wayne macveagh afterwards attorney general of the united states one of the leaders of the bar also one of the most brilliant orators of his time was in college with me though not a classmate | andrew d white whose genius scholarship and organization enabled ezra cornell to found cornell university was another of my college mates | he became one of the most famous of our diplomats and the author of many books of permanent value | my friendship with macveagh and white continued during their lives that is for nearly sixty years | macveagh was one of the readiest and most attractive of speakers i ever knew | he had a very sharp and caustic wit which made him exceedingly popular as an after dinner speaker and as a host in his own house | he made every evening when he entertained for those who were fortunate enough to be his guests an occasion memorable in their experience | john mason brown of kentucky became afterwards the leader of the bar in his state and was about to receive from president harrison an appointment as justice of the supreme court when he died suddenly | if he had been appointed it would have been a remarkable circumstance that three out of nine judges of the greatest of courts an honor which is sought by every one of the hundreds of thousands of lawyers in the united states should have been from the same college and the same class | the faculty lingers in my memory and i have the same reverence and affection for its members though sixty five years out of college that i had the day i graduated | our president theodore d woolsey was a wonderful scholar and a most inspiring teacher | yale has always been fortunate in her presidents and peculiarly so in professor woolsey | he had personal distinction and there was about him an air of authority and reserved power which awed the most radical and rebellious student and at the same time he had the respect and affection of all | in his historical lectures he had a standard joke on the chinese the narration of which amused him the more with each repetition | it was that when a chinese army was beleaguered and besieged in a fortress their provisions gave out and they decided to escape | they selected a very dark night threw open the gates and as they marched out each soldier carried a lighted lantern | in the faculty were several professors of remarkable force and originality | the professor of greek mr hadley father of the distinguished ex president of yale was more than his colleagues in the thought and talk of the undergraduates | his learning and pre eminence in his department were universally admitted | he had a caustic wit and his sayings were the current talk of the campus | he maintained discipline which was quite lax in those days by the exercise of this ability | some of the boys once drove a calf into the recitation room | professor hadley quietly remarked: you will take out that animal | we will get along to day with our usual number | it is needless to say that no such experiment was ever repeated | at one time there was brought up in the faculty meeting a report that one of the secret societies was about to bore an artesian well in the cellar of their club house | it was suggested that such an extraordinary expense should be prohibited | professor hadley closed the discussion and laughed out the subject by saying from what he knew of the society if it would hold a few sessions over the place where the artesian well was projected the boring would be accomplished without cost | the professor was a sympathetic and very wise adviser to the students | if any one was in trouble he would always go to him and give most helpful relief | professor larned inspired among the students a discriminating taste for the best english literature and an ardent love for its classics | professor thacher was one of the most robust and vigorous thinkers and teachers of his period | he was a born leader of men and generation after generation of students who graduated carried into after life the effects of his teaching and personality | we all loved professor olmstead though we were not vitally interested in his department of physics and biology | he was a purist in his department and so confident of his principles that he thought it unnecessary to submit them to practical tests | one of the students whose room was immediately over that of the professor took up a plank from the flooring and by boring a very small hole in the ceiling found that he could read the examination papers on the professor's desk | the information of this reaching the faculty the professor was asked if he had examined the ceiling | he said that was unnecessary because he had measured the distance between the ceiling and the surface of his desk and found that the line of vision connected so far above that nothing could be read on the desk | timothy dwight afterwards president was then a tutor | learning common sense magnetism and all around good fellowship were wonderfully united in president dwight | he was the most popular instructor and best loved by the boys | he had a remarkable talent for organization which made him an ideal president | he possessed the rare faculty of commanding and convincing not only the students but his associates in the faculty and the members of the corporation when discussing and deciding upon business propositions and questions of policy | the final examinations over commencement day arrived | the literary exercises and the conferring of degrees took place in the old center church | i was one of the speakers and selected for my subject the hudson river and its traditions | i was saturated from early association and close investigation and reading with the crises of the revolutionary war which were successfully decided on the patriots' side on the banks of the hudson | i lived near washington irving and his works i knew by heart especially the tales which gave to the hudson a romance like the rhine's | the subject was new for an academic stage and the speech made a hit | nevertheless it was the saddest and most regretful day of my life when i left yale | my education according to the standard of the time was completed and my diploma was its evidence | it has been a very interesting question with me how much the academy and the college contributed to that education | their discipline was necessary and their training essential | four years of association with the faculty learned finely equipped and sympathetic was a wonderful help | the free associations of the secret and debating societies the campus and the sports were invaluable and the friendships formed with congenial spirits added immensely to the pleasures and compensations of a long life | in connection with this i may add that as it has been my lot in the peculiar position which i have occupied for more than half a century as counsel and adviser for a great corporation and its creators and the many successful men of business who have surrounded them i have learned to know how men who have been denied in their youth the opportunities for education feel when they are in possession of fortunes and the world seems at their feet | then they painfully recognize their limitations then they know their weakness then they understand that there are things which money cannot buy and that there are gratifications and triumphs which no fortune can secure | the one lament of all those men has been: oh if i had been educated i would sacrifice all that i have to obtain the opportunities of the college to be able to sustain not only conversation and discussion with the educated men with whom i come in contact but competent also to enjoy what i see is a delight to them beyond anything which i know | but i recall gratefully other influences quite as important to one's education | my father was a typical business man one of the pioneers of river transportation between our village and new york and also a farmer and a merchant | he was a stern man devoted to his family and while a strict disciplinarian very fond of his children | my mother was a woman of unusual intellect bordering upon genius | there were no means of higher education at that period but her father who was an eminent lawyer and her grandfather a judge finding her so receptive educated her with the care that was given to boys who were intended for a professional life | she was well versed in the literature of the time of queen elizabeth and queen anne and with a retentive memory knew by heart many of the english classics | she wrote well but never for publication | added to these accomplishments were rare good sense and prophetic vision | the foundation and much of the superstructure of all that i have and all that i am were her work | she was a rigid calvinist and one of her many lessons has been of inestimable comfort to me | several times in my life i have met with heavy misfortunes and what seemed irreparable losses | i have returned home to find my mother with wise advice and suggestions ready to devote herself to the reconstruction of my fortune and to brace me up | she always said what she thoroughly believed: my son this which you think so great a calamity is really divine discipline | the lord has sent it to you for your own good because in his infinite wisdom he saw that you needed it | i am absolutely certain that if you submit instead of repining and protesting if you will ask with faith and proper spirit for guidance and help they both will come to you and with greater blessings than you ever had before | that faith of my mother inspired and intensified my efforts and in every instance her predictions proved true | every community has a public spirited citizen who unselfishly devotes himself or herself to the public good | that citizen of peekskill in those early days was doctor james brewer | he had accumulated a modest competence sufficient for his simple needs as bachelor | he was either the promoter or among the leaders of all the movements for betterment of the town | he established a circulating library upon most liberal terms and it became an educational institution of benefit | the books were admirably selected and the doctor's advice to readers was always available | his taste ran to the english classics and he had all the standard authors in poetry history fiction and essay | no pleasure derived in reading in after years gave me such delight as the waverley novels | i think i read through that library and some of it several times over | the excitement as the novels of dickens and thackeray began to appear equalled almost the enthusiasm of a political campaign | each one of those authors had ardent admirers and partisans | the characters of dickens became household companions | every one was looking for the counterpart of micawber or sam weller pecksniff or david copperfield and had little trouble in finding them either in the family circle or among the neighbors | dickens's lectures in new york which consisted of readings from his novels were an event which has rarely been duplicated for interest | with high dramatic ability he brought out before the audience the characters from his novels with whom all were familiar | every one in the crowd had an idealistic picture in his mind of the actors of the story | it was curious to note that the presentation which the author gave coincided with the idea of the majority of his audience | i was fresh from the country but had with me that evening a rather ultra fashionable young lady | she said she was not interested in the lecture because it represented the sort of people she did not know and never expected to meet they were a very common lot | in her subsequent career in this country and abroad she had to her credit three matrimonial adventures and two divorces but none of her husbands were of the common lot | speaking of dickens one picture remains indelibly pressed upon my memory | it was the banquet given him at which horace greeley presided | everybody was as familiar with mr pickwick and his portrait by cruikshank in dickens's works as with one's father | when mr greeley arose to make the opening speech and introduce the guest of the evening his likeness to this portrait of pickwick was so remarkable that the whole audience including mr dickens shouted their delight in greeting an old and well beloved friend | another educational opportunity came in my way because one of my uncles was postmaster of the village | through his post office came several high class magazines and foreign reviews | there was no rural delivery in those days and the mail could only be had on personal application and the result was that the subscribers of these periodicals frequently left them a long time before they were called for | i was an omnivorous reader of everything available and as a result these publications especially the foreign reviews became a fascinating source of information and culture | they gave from the first minds of the century criticisms of current literature and expositions of political movements and public men which became of infinite value in after years | another unincorporated and yet valuable school was the frequent sessions at the drug store of the elder statesmen of the village | on certain evenings these men representing most of the activities of the village would avail themselves of the hospitable chairs about the stove and discuss not only local matters but the general conditions of the country some of them revolving about the constitutionality of various measures which had been proposed and enacted into laws | they nearly all related to slavery the compromise measures the introduction of slaves into new territories the fugitive slave law and were discussed with much intelligence and information | the boys heard them talked about in their homes and were eager listeners on the outskirts of this village congress | such institutions are not possible except in the universal acquaintance fellowship and confidences of village and country life | they were the most important factors in forming that public opinion especially among the young which supported mr lincoln in his successful efforts to save the union at whatever cost | a few days after returning home from yale i entered the office of edward wells a lawyer of the village as a student | mr wells had attained high rank in his profession was a profound student of the law and had a number of young men fitting them for the bar under his direction | i was admitted to the bar in 1858 and immediately opened an office in the village | my first client was a prosperous farmer who wanted an opinion on a rather complicated question | i prepared the case with great care | he asked me what my fee was and i told him five dollars | he said: a dollar and seventy five is enough for a young lawyer like you | subsequently he submitted the case to one of the most eminent lawyers in new york who came to the same conclusion and charged him five hundred dollars | on account of this gentleman's national reputation the farmer thought that fee was very reasonable | in subsequent years i have received several very large retainers but none of them gave so much satisfaction as that dollar and seventy five cents which i had actually earned after having been so long dependent on my father | after some years of private practice commodore vanderbilt sent for me and offered the attorneyship for the new york and harlem railroad | i had just been nominated and confirmed united states minister to japan | the appointment was a complete surprise to me as i was not an applicant for any federal position | the salary was seven thousand five hundred dollars and an outfit of nine thousand | the commodore's offer of the attorneyship for the harlem railroad which was his first venture in railroading was far less than the salary as minister | when i said this to the commodore he remarked: railroads are the career for a young man there is nothing in politics | don't be a damned fool | that decided me and on the 1st of january 1921 i rounded out fifty five years in the railway service of this corporation and its allied lines | nothing has impressed me more than little things and apparently immaterial ones which have influenced the careers of many people | my father and his brothers all active business men were also deeply interested in politics not on the practical side but in policies and governmental measures | they were uncompromising democrats of the most conservative type they believed that interference with slavery of any kind imperilled the union of the states and that the union of the states was the sole salvation of the perpetuity of the republic and its liberties | i went to yale saturated with these ideas | yale was a favorite college for southern people | there was a large element from the slaveholding states among the students | it was so considerable that these southerners withdrew from the great debating societies of the college and formed a society of their own which they called the calliopean | outside of these southerners there were very few democrats among the students and i came very near being drawn into the calliopean but happily escaped | the slavery question in all its phases of fugitive slave law and its enforcement the extension of slavery into the new territories or its prohibition and of the abolition of the institution by purchase or confiscation were subjects of discussion on the campus in the literary societies and in frequent lectures in the halls in new haven by the most prominent and gifted speakers and advocates | that was a period when even in the most liberal churches the pulpit was not permitted to preach politics and slavery was pre eminently politics | but according to an old new england custom the pastor was given a free hand on thanksgiving day to unburden his mind of everything which had been bubbling and seething there for a year | one of the most eminent and eloquent of new england preachers was the reverend doctor bacon of center church new haven | his thanksgiving sermon was an event eagerly anticipated by the whole college community | he was violently anti slavery | his sermons were not only intently listened to but widely read and their effect in promoting anti slavery sentiment was very great | the result of several years of these associations and discussions converted me and i became a republican on the principles enunciated in the first platform of the party in 1856 | when i came home from yale the situation in the family became very painful because my father was an intense partisan | he had for his party both faith and love and was shocked and grieved at his son's change of principles | he could not avoid constantly discussing the question and was equally hurt either by opposition or silence |ii  in public life the campaign of 1856 created an excitement in our village which had never been known since the revolutionary war | the old families who had been settled there since colonial days were mainly pro slavery and democratic while the republican party was recruited very largely from new england men and in a minority | several times in our national political campaigns there has been one orator who drew audiences and received public attention and reports in the newspapers beyond all other speakers | on the democratic side during that period horatio seymour was pre eminent | on the republican side in the state of new york the attractive figure was george william curtis | his books were very popular his charming personality the culture and the elevation of his speeches put him in a class by himself | the republicans of the village were highly elated when they had secured the promise of mr curtis to speak at their most important mass meeting | the occasion drew together the largest audience the village had known composed not only of residents but many from a distance | the committee of arrangements finally reported to the waiting audience that the last train had arrived but mr curtis had not come | it suddenly occurred to the committee that it would be a good thing to call a young recruit from a well known democratic family and publicly commit him | first came the invitation then the shouting and when i arose they cried platform and i was escorted to the platform but had no idea of making a speech | my experience for years at college and at home had saturated me with the questions at issue in all their aspects | from a full heart and a sore one i poured out a confession of faith | i thought i had spoken only a few minutes but found afterwards that it was over an hour | the local committee wrote to the state committee about the meeting and in a few days i received a letter from the chairman of the state committee inviting me to fill a series of engagements covering the whole state of new york | the campaign of 1856 differed from all others in memory of men then living | the issues between the parties appealed on the republican side to the young | there had grown up among the young voters an intense hostility to slavery | the moral force of the arguments against the institution captured them | they had no hostility to the south nor to the southern slaveholders they regarded their position as an inheritance and were willing to help on the lines of mr lincoln's original idea of purchasing the slaves and freeing them | but the suggestion had no friends among the slaveholders | these young men believed that any extension or strengthening of the institution would be disastrous to the country | the threatened dissolution of the union secession or rebellion did not frighten them | political conventions are the most interesting of popular gatherings | the members have been delegated by their fellow citizens to represent them and they are above the average in intelligence political information of conditions in the state and nation as the convention represents the state or the republic | the belief that they are generally boss governed is a mistake | the party leader sometimes designated as boss invariably consults with the strongest men there are in the convention before he arrives at a decision | he is generally successful because he has so well prepared the way and his own judgment is always modified and frequently changed in these conferences | in 1858 i had the first sensation of the responsibility of public office | i was not an applicant for the place in fact knew nothing about it until i was elected a delegate to the republican state convention from the third assembly district of westchester county | the convention was held at syracuse | the westchester delegates arrived late at night or rather early in the morning and we came to the hotel with large numbers of other delegates from different sections who had arrived on the same train | it was two o'clock but the state leader thurlow weed was in the lobby of the hotel to greet the delegates | he said to me: you are from peekskill | with whom are you studying law | i answered: with judge william nelson |  oh he remarked i remember judge nelson well | he was very active in the campaign of 1828 | it was a feat of memory to thus recall the usefulness of a local politician thirty years before | i noticed as each delegate was introduced that mr weed had some neighborhood recollections of the man which put a tag on him | the next day as we met the leader he recalled us by name the places where we lived and the districts represented | mr blaine was the only other man i ever met or knew who possessed this extraordinary gift for party leadership | there was a revolt in the convention among the young members who had a candidate of their own | mr weed's candidate for governor was edwin d morgan a successful new york merchant who had made a good record as a state senator | i remember one of mr weed's arguments was that the democrats were in power everywhere and could assess their office holders while the republicans would have to rely for campaign funds upon voluntary contributions which would come nowhere so freely as from mr morgan and his friends | when the convention met mr weed had won over a large majority of the delegates for his candidate | it was a triumph not only of his skill but of his magnetism which were always successfully exerted upon a doubtful member | i was elected to the assembly the popular branch of the new york legislature in 1861 | i was nominated during an absence from the state without being a candidate or knowing of it until my return | of course i could expect nothing from my father and my own earnings were not large so i had to rely upon a personal canvass of a district which had been largely spoiled by rich candidates running against each other and spending large amounts of money | i made a hot canvass speaking every day and with an investment of less than one hundred dollars for travel and other expenses i was triumphantly elected | by far the most interesting member of the legislature was the speaker henry j raymond | he was one of the most remarkable men i ever met | during the session i became intimate with him and the better i knew him the more i became impressed with his genius the variety of his attainments the perfection of his equipment and his ready command of all his powers and resources | raymond was then editor of the new york times and contributed a leading article every day | he was the best debater we had and the most convincing | i have seen him often when some other member was in the chair of the committee of the whole and we were discussing a critical question take his seat on the floor and commence writing an editorial | as the debate progressed he would rise and participate | when he had made his point which he always did with directness and lucidity he would resume writing his editorial | the debate would usually end with mr raymond carrying his point and also finishing his editorial an example which seems to refute the statement of metaphysicians that two parts of the mind cannot work at the same time | two years afterwards when i was secretary of state i passed much of my time at saratoga because it was so near albany | mr raymond was also there writing the life of abraham lincoln | i breakfasted with him frequently and found that he had written for an hour or more before breakfast | he said to me in explanation that if one would take an hour before breakfast every morning and concentrate his mind upon his subject he would soon fill a library | mr raymond had been as a young man a reporter in the united states senate | he told me that while at that time there was no system of shorthand or stenography he had devised a crude one for himself by which he could take down accurately any address of a deliberate speaker | daniel webster the most famous orator our country has ever produced was very deliberate in his utterances | he soon discovered raymond's ability and for several years he always had raymond with him and once said to him: except for you the world would have very few of my speeches | your reports have preserved them | mr raymond told me this story of mr webster's remarkable memory | once he said to mr webster: you never use notes and apparently have made no preparation yet you are the only speaker i report whose speeches are perfect in structure language and rhetoric | how is this possible | webster replied: it is my memory | i can prepare a speech revise and correct it in my memory and then deliver the corrected speech exactly as finished | i have known most of the great orators of the world but none had any approach to a faculty like this though several could repeat after second reading the speech which they had prepared | in 1862 i was candidate for re election to the assembly | political conditions had so changed that they were almost reversed | the enthusiasm of the war which had carried the republicans into power the year before had been succeeded by general unrest | our armies had been defeated and industrial and commercial depression was general | the leader of the democratic party in the state was dean richmond | he was one of those original men of great brain power force and character knowledge of men and executive ability of which that period had a number | from the humblest beginning he had worked his way in politics to the leadership of his party to the presidency of the greatest corporation in the state the new york central railroad company and in his many and successful adventures had accumulated a fortune | his foresight was almost a gift of prophecy and his judgment was rarely wrong | he believed that the disasters in the field and the bad times at home could be charged up to the lincoln administration and lead to a democratic victory | he also believed that there was only one man in the party whose leadership would surely win and that man was horatio seymour | but seymour had higher ambitions than the governorship of new york and was very reluctant to run | nevertheless he could not resist richmond's insistence that he must sacrifice himself if necessary to save the party | the republicans nominated general james w wadsworth for governor | wadsworth had enlisted at the beginning of the war and made a most brilliant record both as a fighting soldier and administrator | the republican party was sharply divided between radicals who insisted on immediate emancipation of the slaves and conservatives who thought the time had not yet arrived for such a revolution | the radicals were led by horace greeley and the conservatives by thurlow weed and henry j raymond | horatio seymour made a brilliant canvass | he had no equal in the state in either party in charm of personality and attractive oratory | he united his party and brought to its ranks all the elements of unrest and dissatisfaction with conditions military and financial | while general wadsworth was an ideal candidate he failed to get the cordial and united support of his party | he represented its progressive tendencies as expressed and believed by president lincoln and was hostile to reaction | under these conditions governor seymour carried the state | the election had reversed the overwhelming republican majority in the legislature of the year before by making the assembly a tie | i was re elected but by reduced majority | the assembly being a tie it was several weeks before it could organize | i was the candidate in the caucus of the republican members for speaker but after the nomination one of the members named bemus threatened to bolt and vote for the democratic candidate unless his candidate sherwood was made the nominee | so many believed that bemus would carry out his threat which would give the organization of the house to the democrats by one majority that i withdrew in favor of sherwood | after voting hopelessly in a deadlock day after day for a long period a caucus of the republican members was called at which sherwood withdrew and on his motion i was nominated as the party candidate for speaker | during the night a democratic member t c | callicot of kings county came to my bedroom and said: my ambition in life is to be speaker of the assembly | under the law the legislature cannot elect the united states senator unless each house has first made a nomination then the senate and the house can go into joint convention and a majority of that convention elect a senator | you republicans have a majority in the senate so that if the house nominates the legislature can go into joint convention and elect a republican senator | as long as the house remains a tie this cannot be done | now what i propose is just this: before we meet tomorrow morning if you will call your members together and nominate me for speaker the vote of your party and i voting for myself will elect me | then i will agree to name general dix a democrat for united states senator and if your people will all vote with me for him he will be the assembly nominee | the senate has already nominated governor morgan | so the next day the legislature can go into joint convention and having a republican majority elect governor morgan united states senator | i told mr callicot that i would present the matter to my party associates | in the early morning saxton smith and colonel john van buren two of the most eminent democrats in the state and members of the legislature came to me and said: we know what callicot has proposed | now if you will reject that proposition we will elect you speaker practically unanimously | this assured my election for the speakership | i had a great ambition to be on that roll of honor and as i would have been the youngest man ever elected to the position my youth added to the distinction | on the other hand the government at washington needed an experienced senator of its own party like edwin d morgan who had been one of the ablest and most efficient of war governors both in furnishing troops and helping the credit of the country | i finally decided to surrender the speakership for myself to gain the senatorship for my party | i had difficulty in persuading my associates but they finally agreed | callicot was elected speaker and edwin d morgan united states senator | the event was so important and excited so much interest both in the state and in the country that representative men came to albany in great numbers | the rejoicing and enthusiasm were intense at having secured so unexpectedly a united states senator for the support of mr lincoln's administration | that night they all united in giving me a reception in the ballroom of the hotel | there was a flood of eulogistic and prophetic oratory | i was overwhelmed with every form of flattery and applause for distinguished service to the party | by midnight i had been nominated and elected governor of the state and an hour later i was already a united states senator | before the morning hour the presidency of the united states was impatiently waiting for the time when i would be old enough to be eligible | all this was soon forgotten | it is a common experience of the instability of promises and hopes which come from gratified and happy enthusiasts and how soon they are dissipated like a dream | i have seen many such instances and from this early experience deeply sympathize with the disillusionized hero | the democrats of the assembly and also of the state were determined that mr callicot should not enjoy the speakership | they started investigations in the house and movements in the courts to prevent him from taking his seat | the result was that i became acting speaker and continued as such until mr callicot had defeated his enemies and taken his place as speaker in the latter part of the session | i was also chairman of the committee of ways and means and the leader of the house | the budget of my committee was larger than usual on account of the expenses of the war | it was about seven million dollars | it created much more excitement and general discussion than does the present budget of one hundred and forty millions | the reason is the difference in conditions and public necessities of the state of new york in the winter of 1863 and now | it is also partly accounted for by the fact that the expenses of the state had then to be met by a real estate tax which affected everybody while now an income tax has been adopted which is capable of unlimited expansion and invites limitless extravagance because of the comparatively few interested | eighteen hundred and sixty three was an eventful year the early part was full of gloom and unrest | horatio seymour as governor violently antagonized president lincoln and his policies | seymour was patriotic and very able but he was so saturated with state rights and strict construction of the constitution that it marred his judgment and clouded his usually clear vision | in the critical situation of the country mr lincoln saw the necessity of support of the state of new york | to this message sent through thurlow weed governor seymour made no reply | he did not believe that the south could be defeated and the union preserved | later president lincoln sent a personal letter to the governor | it was a very human epistle | the president wrote: you and i are substantially strangers and i write this that we may become better acquainted | governor seymour made no reply | he and the other democratic leaders thought the president uncouth unlettered and very weak | the phrase please write me at least as long a letter as this produced an impression upon the scholarly cultured cautious and diplomatic seymour which was most unfavorable to its author | seymour acknowledged the receipt of the letter and promised to make a reply but never did | it is of course beyond the range of such a speculation by itself to enter on an examination of the positive evidences in support of one form of belief rather than another | so far as it aims only at exhibiting an universal law of the human mind it is of course compatible with all special forms of belief which do not contradict that law and none whatever their pretensions can really contradict it | hence the service which such a philosophy can render to the christian religion must necessarily from the nature of the case be of an indirect and negative character | it prepares the way for a fair examination of the proper evidences of christianity by showing that there is no ground for any priori prejudice against revelation as appealing for the acceptance of its highest truths to faith rather than to reason for that this appeal is common to all religions and to all philosophies and cannot therefore be urged against one more than another | so far as certain difficulties are inherent in the constitution of the human mind itself they must necessarily occupy the same position with respect to all religions alike | to exhibit the nature of these difficulties is a service to true religion but it is the service of the pioneer not of the builder it does not prove the religion to be true it only clears the ground for the production of the special evidences |  q letter to mr calderwood | see lectures vol | ii p |534  where those evidences are to be found sir w hamilton has not failed to tell us | if mere intellectual speculations on the nature and origin of the material universe form a common ground in which the theist the pantheist and even the atheist may alike expatiate the moral and religious feelings of man those facts of consciousness which have their direct source in the sense of personality and free will plead with overwhelming evidence in behalf of a personal god and of man's relation to him as a person to a person | by our immediate consciousness of a moral and personal nature we are led to the belief in a moral and personal god: by our ignorance of the unconditioned we are led to the further belief that behind that moral and personal manifestation of god there lies concealed a mystery the mystery of the absolute and the infinite that our intellectual and moral qualities though indicating the nearest approach to the divine perfections which we are capable of conceiving yet indicate them as analogous not as identical that we may naturally expect to find points where this analogy will fail us where the function of the infinite moral governor will be distinct from that of the finite moral servant and where consequently we shall be liable to error in judging by human rules of the ways of god whether manifested in nature or in revelation | such is the true lesson to be learnt from a philosophy which tells us of a god who is in a certain sense revealed in a certain sense concealed at once known and unknown |  r lectures vol | i p |30   s lectures vol | i p |33   t ibid p |42  it is not surprising that this philosophy when compared with that of a critic like mr mill should stand out in clear and sharp antagonism | mr mill is one of the most distinguished representatives of that school of materialism which sir w hamilton denounces as virtual atheism | we do not mean that he consciously adopts the grosser tenets of the materialists | we are not aware that he has ever positively denied the existence of a soul distinct from the body or maintained that the brain secretes thought as the liver secretes bile | but he is the advocate of a philosophical method which makes the belief in the existence of an immaterial principle superfluous and incongruous he not only acknowledges no such distinction between the phenomena of mind and those of matter as to require the hypothesis of a free intelligence to account for it he not only regards the ascertained laws of coexistence and succession in material phenomena as the type and rule according to which all phenomena whatever those of internal consciousness no less than of external observation are to be tested but he even expressly denies the existence of that free will which sir w hamilton regards as the indispensable condition of all morality and all religion |  u thus instead of recognising in the facts of intelligence an order of existence diametrically in contrast to that displayed to us in the facts of the material universe v he regards both classes of facts as of the same kind and explicable by the same laws he abolishes the primary contrast of consciousness between the ego and the non ego the person and the thing he reduces man to a thing instead of a person to one among the many phenomena of the universe determined by the same laws of invariable antecedence and consequence included under the same formul of empirical generalization | he thus makes man the slave and not the master of nature passively carried along in the current of successive phenomena unable by any act of free will to arrest a single wave in its course or to divert it from its ordained direction |  u that this is the real battle ground between the two philosophers is virtually admitted by mr mill himself at the end of his criticism | he says: the whole philosophy of sir w hamilton seems to have had its character determined by the requirements of the doctrine of free will and to that doctrine he clung because he had persuaded himself that it afforded the only premises from which human reason could deduce the doctrines of natural religion | i believe that in this persuasion he was thoroughly his own dupe and that his speculations have weakened the philosophical foundation of religion fully as much as they have confirmed it p |549  mr mill's whole philosophy on the other hand is determined by the requirements of the doctrine of necessity and to that doctrine he intrepidly adheres in utter defiance of consciousness and sometimes of his own consistency | which of the two philosophers is really his own dupe mr mill in believing that morality and religion can exist without free will that a necessary agent can be responsible for his acts or sir w hamilton in maintaining the contrary is a question which the former has by no means satisfactorily settled in his own favour |  v hamilton lectures vol | i p |29  this diametrical antagonism between the two philosophers is not limited to their first principles but extends as might naturally be expected to every subordinate science of which the immediate object is mental and not material | logic instead of being as sir w hamilton regards it an priori science of the necessary laws of thought is with mr mill a science of observation investigating those operations of the understanding which are subservient to the estimation of evidence |  w the axioms of mathematics which the former philosopher regards with kant as necessary thoughts based on the priori intuitions of space and time the latter x declares to be experimental truths generalizations from observation | introduction 7 |  x ibid book ii | 5 4 |  y mill's logic book vi | 4 3 |  z ibid book vi | 5 4 | the contrast between the two philosophers being thus thoroughgoing it was natural to expect beforehand that an examination of sir william hamilton's philosophy by mr mill would contain a sharp and vigorous assault on the principal doctrines of that philosophy | and this expectation has been amply fulfilled | but there was also reason to expect from the ability and critical power displayed in mr mill's previous writings that his assault whether successful or not in overthrowing his enemy would at least be guided by a clear knowledge of that enemy's position and purposes that his dissent would be accompanied by an intelligent apprehension and an accurate statement of the doctrines dissented from | in this expectation we regret to say we have been disappointed | not only is mr mill's attack on hamilton's philosophy with the exception of some minor details unsuccessful but we are compelled to add that with regard to the three fundamental doctrines of that philosophy the relativity of knowledge the incognisability of the absolute and infinite and the distinction between reason and faith mr mill has throughout his criticism altogether missed the meaning of the theories he is attempting to assail | this is a serious charge to bring against a writer of such eminence as mr mill and one which should not be advanced without ample proof | first then of the relativity of knowledge | the assertion that all our knowledge is relative in other words that we know things only under such conditions as the laws of our cognitive faculties impose upon us is a statement which looks at first sight like a truism but which really contains an answer to a very important question have we reason to believe that the laws of our cognitive faculties impose any conditions at all that the mind in any way reacts on the objects affecting it so as to produce a result different from that which would be produced were it merely a passive recipient | can what bacon says of the fallacies of the mind be also said of its proper cognitions | does the mind by its own action in any way distort the appearance of the things presented to it and if so how far does the distortion extend and in what manner is it to be rectified | to trace the course of this inquiry from the day when plato compared the objects perceived by the senses to the shadows thrown by fire on the wall of a cave to the day when kant declared that we know only phenomena not things in themselves would be to write the history of philosophy | we can only at present call attention to one movement in that history which was in effect a revolution in philosophy | the older philosophers in general distinguished between the senses and the intellect regarding the former as deceptive and concerned with phenomena alone the latter as trustworthy and conversant with the realities of things | hence arose the distinction between the sensible and the intelligible world between things as perceived by sense and things as apprehended by intellect between phenomenology and ontology | kant rejected this distinction holding that the intellect as well as the sense imposes its own forms on the things presented to it and is therefore cognisant only of phenomena not of things in themselves | the logical result of this position would be the abolition of ontology as a science of things in themselves and fortiori of that highest branch of ontology which aims at a knowledge of the absolute aa greek: kat' exoch n of the unconditioned first principle of all things | if the mind in every act of thought imposes its own forms on its objects to think is to condition and the unconditioned is the unthinkable | such was the logical result of kant's principles but not the actual result | for kant by distinguishing between the understanding and the reason and giving to the latter an indirect yet positive cognition of the unconditioned as a regulative principle of thought prepared the way for the systems of schelling and hegel in which this indirect cognition is converted into a direct one by investing the reason thus distinguished as the special faculty of the unconditioned with a power of intuition emancipated from the conditions of space and time and even of subject and object or a power of thought emancipated from the laws of identity and contradiction |  aa the term absolute in the sense of free from relation may be used in two applications 1st to denote the nature of a thing as it is in itself as distinguished from its appearance to us | here it is used only in a subordinate sense as meaning out of relation to human knowledge | 2ndly to denote the nature of a thing as independent of all other things as having no relation to any other thing as the condition of its existence | here it is used in its highest sense as meaning out of relation to anything else | the theory of hamilton is a modification of that of kant intended to obviate these consequences and to relieve the kantian doctrine itself from the inconsistency which gave rise to them | so long as the reason is regarded as a separate faculty from the understanding and things in themselves as ideas of the reason so long the apparent contradictions which encumber the attempt to conceive the unconditioned must be regarded as inherent in the constitution of the reason itself and as the result of its legitimate exercise on its proper objects | this sceptical conclusion hamilton endeavoured to avoid by rejecting the distinction between the understanding and the reason as separate faculties regarding the one as the legitimate and positive the other as the illegitimate and negative exercise of one and the same faculty | he thus announces in opposition to kant the fundamental doctrine of the conditioned as the distinction between intelligence within its legitimate sphere of operation impeccable and intelligence beyond that sphere affording by abuse the occasions of error |  ab hamilton like kant maintained that all our cognitions are compounded of two elements one contributed by the object known and the other by the mind knowing | but the very conception of a relation implies the existence of things to be related and the knowledge of an object as in relation to our mind necessarily implies its existence out of that relation | but as so existing it is unknown: we believe that it is we know not what it is | how far it resembles or how far it does not resemble the object apprehended by us we cannot say for we have no means of comparing the two together |  ab discussions p |633  instead therefore of saying with kant that reason is subject to an inevitable delusion by which it mistakes the regulative principles of its own thoughts for the representations of real things hamilton would say that the reason while compelled to believe in the existence of these real things is not legitimately entitled to make any positive representation of them as of such or such a nature and that the contradictions into which it falls when attempting to do so are due to an illegitimate attempt to transcend the proper boundaries of positive thought | this theory does not in itself contain any statement of the mode in which we perceive the material world whether directly by presentation or indirectly by representative images and perhaps it might without any great violence be adapted to more than one of the current hypotheses on this point | but that to which it most easily adjusts itself is that maintained by hamilton himself under the name of natural realism | to speak of perception as a relation between mind and matter naturally implies the presence of both correlatives though each may be modified by its contact with the other | the acid may act on the alkali and the alkali on the acid in forming the neutral salt but each of the ingredients is as truly present as the other though each enters into the compound in a modified form | and this is equally the case in perception even if we suppose various media to intervene between the ultimate object and the perceiving mind such e g as the rays of light and the sensitive organism in vision so long as these media are material like the ultimate object itself | whether the object properly so called in vision be the rays of light in contact with the organ or the body emitting or reflecting those rays is indifferent to the present question so long as a material object of some kind or other is supposed to be perceived and not merely an inmaterial representation of such an object | to speak of our perceptions as mere modifications of mind produced by an unknown cause would be like maintaining that the acid is modified by the influence of the alkali without entering into combination with it | such a view might perhaps be tolerated in connection with the theory of relativity by an indulgent interpretation of language but it is certainly not that which the language of the theory most naturally suggests | all this mr mill entirely misapprehends | it cannot however warrant the assertion that all our knowledge but only that the part so added is relative | if our author had gone as far as kant and had said that all which constitutes knowledge is put in by the mind itself he would have really held in one of its forms the doctrine of the relativity of our knowledge | but what he does say far from implying that the whole of our knowledge is relative distinctly imports that all of it which is real and authentic is the reverse | if any part of what we fancy that we perceive in the objects themselves originates in the perceiving organs or in the cognising mind thus much is purely relative but since by supposition it does not all so originate the part that does not is as much absolute as if it were not liable to be mixed up with these delusive subjective impressions p |30  mr mill therefore supposes that wholly relative must mean wholly mental in other words that to say that a thing is wholly due to a relation between mind and matter is equivalent to saying that it is wholly due to mind alone | on the contrary we maintain that sir w hamilton's language is far more accurate than mr mill's and that the above theory can with perfect correctness be described as one of total relativity and this from two points of view | first as opposed to the theory of partial relativity generally held by the pre kantian philosophers according to which our sensitive cognitions are relative our intellectual ones absolute | secondly as asserting that the object of perception though composed of elements partly material partly mental yet exhibits both alike in a form modified by their relation to each other | the composition is not a mere mechanical juxtaposition in which each part though acting on the other retains its own characteristics unchanged | it may be rather likened to a chemical fusion in which both elements are present but each of them is affected by the composition | the material part therefore is not as much absolute as if it were not liable to be mixed up with subjective impressions | the confusion according to him is not inextricable | we may neglect to do this and as far as the mind's share is concerned we can only do it by the help of philosophy but it is a task to which in his opinion philosophy is equal | by thus stripping off such of the elements in our apparent cognitions of things as are but cognitions of something in us and consequently relative we may succeed in uncovering the pure nucleus the direct intuitions of things in themselves as we correct the observed positions of the heavenly bodies by allowing for the error due to the refracting influence of the atmospheric medium an influence which does not alter the facts but only our perception of them | surely mr mill here demands much more of philosophy than sir w hamilton deems it capable of accomplishing | why may not hamilton like kant distinguish between the permanent and necessary and the variable and contingent in other words between the subjective and the objective elements of consciousness without therefore obtaining a direct intuition of things in themselves | why may he not distinguish between space and time as the forms of our sensitive cognitions and the things perceived in space and time which constitute the matter of the same cognitions without thereby having an intuition on the one hand of pure space and time with nothing in them or on the other of things in themselves out of space and time | if certain elements are always present in perception while certain others change with every act i may surely infer that the one is due to the permanent subject the other to the variable object without thereby knowing what each would be if it could be discerned apart from the other |  a direct intuition of things in themselves according to kant and hamilton is an intuition of things out of space and time | does mr mill suppose that any natural realist professes to have such an intuition | the same error of supposing that a doctrine of relativity is necessarily a doctrine of idealism that matter known only in relation to us can mean nothing more than matter known only through the mental impressions of which it is the unknown cause ac runs through the whole of mr mill's argument against this portion of sir w hamilton's teaching | that argument though repeated in various forms may be briefly summed up in one thesis namely that the doctrine that our knowledge of matter is wholly relative is incompatible with the distinction which hamilton expressly makes between the primary and secondary qualities of body |  ac the assumption that these two expressions are or ought to be synonymous is tacitly made by mr mill at the opening of this chapter | he opens it with a passage from the discussions in which hamilton says that the existence of things in themselves is only indirectly revealed to us through certain qualities related to our faculties of knowledge and then proceeds to show that the author did not hold the doctrine which these phrases seem to convey in the only substantial meaning capable of being attached to them namely that we know nothing of objects except their existence and the impressions produced by them upon the human mind | having thus quietly assumed that things in themselves are identical with objects and relations with impressions on the human mind mr mill bases his whole criticism on this tacit petitio principii | he is not aware that though reid sometimes uses the term relative in this inaccurate sense hamilton expressly points out the inaccuracy and explains the proper sense see reid's works pp | 313 322 | the most curious circumstance about this criticism is that if not directly borrowed from it has at least been carefully anticipated by hamilton himself | of the distinction between primary and secondary qualities as acknowledged by descartes and locke whose theory of external perception is identical with that which mr mill would force on hamilton himself hamilton says: on the general doctrine however of these philosophers both classes of qualities as known are confessedly only states of our own minds and while we have no right from a subjective affection to infer the existence far less the corresponding character of the existence of any objective reality it is evident that their doctrine if fairly evolved would result in a dogmatic or in a sceptical negation of the primary no less than of the secondary qualities of body as more than appearances in and for us |  ad it is astonishing that mr mill who pounces eagerly on every imaginable instance of hamilton's inconsistency should have neglected to notice this which if his criticism be true is the most glaring inconsistency of all |  ad reid's works p |840  but hamilton continues: it is therefore manifest that the fundamental position of a consistent theory of dualistic realism is that our cognitions of extension and its modes are not wholly ideal that although space be a native necessary priori form of imagination and so far therefore a mere subjective state that there is at the same time competent to us in an immediate perception of external things the consciousness of a really existent of a really objective extended world | in our country public life is a most uncertain career for a young man | its duties and activities remove him from his profession or business and impose habits of work and thought which unfit him for ordinary pursuits especially if he remains long in public service | with a change of administration or of party popularity he may be at any time dropped and left hopelessly stranded | on the other hand if his party is in power he has in it a position of influence and popularity | he has a host of friends with many people dependent upon him for their own places and it is no easy thing for him to retire | when i had decided not to remain any longer in public life and return home the convention of my old district which i had represented in the legislature renominated me for the old position with such earnestness and affection that it was very difficult to refuse and to persuade them that it was absolutely necessary for me to resume actively my profession | our village of peekskill which has since grown into the largest village in the state with many manufacturing and other interests was then comparatively small | a large number of people gathered at the post office every morning | on one occasion when i arrived i found them studying a large envelope addressed to me which the postmaster had passed around | it was a letter from william h seward secretary of state announcing that the president had appointed me united states minister to japan and that the appointment had been sent to the senate and confirmed by that body and directing that i appear at the earliest possible moment at his office to receive instructions and go to my post | a few days afterwards i received a beautiful letter from henry j raymond then in congress urging my acceptance | on arriving in washington i went to see mr seward who said to me: i have special reasons for securing your appointment from the president | he is rewarding friends of his by putting them in diplomatic positions for which they are wholly unfit | i regard the opening of japan to commerce and our relations to that new and promising country so important that i asked the privilege to select one whom i thought fitted for the position | your youth familiarity with public life and ability seem to me ideal for this position and i have no doubt you will accept | i stated to him how necessary it was that after long neglect in public life of my private affairs i should return to my profession if i was to make a career but mr seward brushed that aside by reciting his own success notwithstanding his long service in our state and in washington |  however he continued i feared that this might be your attitude so i have made an appointment for you to see mr burlingame who has been our minister to china and is now here at the head of a mission from china to the different nations of the world | anson burlingame's career had been most picturesque and had attracted the attention of not only the united states but of europe | as a member of the house of representatives he had accepted the challenge of a fire eater who had sent it under the general view that no northern man would fight | as minister to china he had so gained the confidence of the chinese government that he persuaded them to open diplomatic relations with the western world and at their request he had resigned his position from the united states and accepted the place of ambassador to the great powers and was at the head of a large delegation composed of the most important influential and representative mandarins of the old empire | when i sent up my card to his room at the hotel his answer was: come up immediately | he was shaving and had on the minimum of clothes permissible to receive a visitor | he was expecting me and started in at once with an eloquent description of the attractions and importance of the mission to japan | with the shaving brush in one hand and the razor in the other he delivered an oration | in order to emphasize it and have time to think and enforce a new idea he would apply the brush and the razor vigorously then pause and resume | i cannot remember his exact words but have a keen recollection of the general trend of his argument | he said: i am surprised that a young man like you unmarried and with no social obligations should hesitate for a moment to accept this most important and attractive position | if you think these people are barbarians i can assure you that they had a civilization and a highly developed literature when our forefathers were painted savages | the western nations of europe in order to secure advantages in this newly opened country for commerce have sent their ablest representatives | you will meet there with the diplomats of all the western nations and your intimacy with them will be a university of the largest opportunity | you will come in contact with the best minds of europe | you can make a great reputation in the keen rivalry of this situation by securing the best of the trade of japan for your own country to its western coasts over the waters of the pacific | you will be welcomed by the japanese government and the minister of foreign affairs will assign you a palace to live in with a garden attached so perfectly appointed and kept as to have been the envy of shenstone | you will be attended by hundreds of beautiful and accomplished japanese maidens | when i repeated to a large body of waiting office seekers who had assembled in my room what mr burlingame had said they all became applicants for the place | there is no more striking evidence of the wonderful advance in every way of the japanese empire and its people than the conditions existing at that time and now | then it took six months to reach japan and a year for the round trip | of course there was no telegraphic or cable communication and so it required a year for a message to be sent and answered | the japanese army at that time was mostly clad in armor and its navy were junks | in fifty years japan has become one of the most advanced nations of the world | it has adopted and assimilated all that is best of western civilization and acquired in half a century what required europe one thousand years to achieve | its army is unexcelled in equipment and discipline and its navy and mercantile marine are advancing rapidly to a foremost place | it demonstrated its prowess in the war with russia and its diplomacy and power in the recent war | japan has installed popular education with common schools academies and universities much on the american plan | it has adopted and installed every modern appliance developed by electricity telegraph cable telephone etc | while i was greatly tempted to reverse my decision and go my mother who was in delicate health felt that an absence so long and at such distance would be fatal and so on her account i declined | as i look back over the fifty years i can see plainly that four years and probably eight in that mission would have severed me entirely from all professional and business opportunities at home and i might have of necessity become a place holder and a place seeker with all its adventures and disappointments | if i had seriously wanted an office and gone in pursuit of one my pathway would have had the usual difficulties but fickle fortune seemed determined to defeat my return to private life by tempting offers | the collectorship of the port of new york was vacant | it was a position of great political power because of its patronage | there being no civil service the appointments were sufficiently numerous and important to largely control the party in the state of new york and its political influence reached into other commonwealths | it was an office whose fees were enormous and the emoluments far larger than those of any position in the country | the party leaders had begun to doubt president johnson and they wanted in the collectorship a man in whom they had entire confidence and so the governor and state officers who were all republicans the republican members of the legislature the state committee the two united states senators and the republican delegation of new york in the house of representatives unanimously requested the president to appoint me | president johnson said to me: no such recommendation and indorsement has ever been presented to me before | however the breach between him and the party was widening and he could not come to a decision | one day he suddenly sent for senator morgan henry j raymond thurlow weed and the secretary of the treasury for a consultation | he said to them: i have decided to appoint mr |depew  the appointment was made out by the secretary of the treasury and the president instructed him to send it to the senate the next morning | there was great rejoicing among the republicans as this seemed to indicate a favorable turn in the president's mind | days and weeks passed however and when the veto of the civil rights bill was overridden in the senate and with the help of the votes of the senators from new york the breach between the president and his party became irreconcilable the movement for his impeachment began which ended in the most sensational and perilous trial in our political history | on my way home to new york after the vote of the new york senators had ended my hope for appointment i had as a fellow traveller my friend professor davies from west point | he was a brother of that eminent jurist henry e davies a great lawyer and chief justice of our new york state court of appeals | professor davies said to me: i think i must tell you why your nomination for collector was not sent to the senate | i was in washington to persuade the president with whom i am quite intimate to make another appointment | i was calling on secretary hugh mcculloch and his family in the evening of the day when the conference decided to appoint you | secretary mcculloch said to me: 'the contest over the collectorship of the port of new york is settled and chauncey depew's name will be sent to the senate to morrow morning '| i was at the white house continued the professor the next morning before breakfast | the president received me at once because i said my mission was urgent and personal | i told him what the secretary of the treasury had told me and said: 'you are making a fatal mistake | you are going to break with your party and to have a party of your own | the collectorship of the port of new york is the key to your success | depew is very capable and a partisan of his party | if you have any doubt i beg of you to withhold the appointment until the question comes up in the senate of sustaining or overriding of the veto of the civil rights bill | the votes of the two new york senators will decide whether they are your friends or not '| the president thought that was reasonable and you know the result | there was at least one satisfaction in the professor's amazingly frank revelation: it removed all doubt why i had lost a great office and for my age and circumstances a large fortune | president andrew johnson differed radically from any president of the united states whom it has been my good fortune to know | this refers to all from and including mr lincoln to mr harding | a great deal must be forgiven and a great deal taken by way of explanation when we consider his early environment and opportunities | in the interviews i had with him he impressed me as a man of vigorous mentality of obstinate wilfulness and overwhelming confidence in his own judgment and the courage of his convictions | his weakness was alcoholism | he made a fearful exhibition of himself at the time of his inauguration and during the presidency and especially during his famous trip around the circle he was in a bad way | he was of humble origin and in fact very poor | it is said of him that he could neither read nor write until his wife taught him | he made a great career both as a member of the house of representatives and a senator and was of unquestionable influence in each branch | with reckless disregard for his life he kept east tennessee in the union during the civil war | general grant told me a story of his own experience with him | johnson he said had always been treated with such contempt and ignored socially by the members of the old families and slave aristocracy of the south that his resentment against them was vindictive and so after the surrender at appomattox he was constantly proclaiming treason is odious and must be punished | he also wanted and in fact insisted upon ignoring grant's parole to the confederate officers in order that they might be tried for treason | on this question of maintaining his parole and his military honor general grant was inflexible and said he would appeal not only to congress but to the country | one day a delegation consisting of the most eminent politically socially and in family descent of the southern leaders went to the white house | they said: mr president we have never recognized you as you belong to an entirely different class from ourselves but it is the rule of all countries and in all ages that supreme power vested in the individual raises him no matter what his origin to supreme leadership | you are now president of the united states and by virtue of your office our leader and we recognize you as such | then followed attention from these people whom he admired and envied as well as hated of hospitality and deference of which they were past masters | it captivated him and changed his whole attitude towards them | he sent for general grant and said to him: the war is over and there should be forgiveness and reconciliation | i propose to call upon all of the states recently in rebellion to send to washington their united states senators and members of the house the same as they did before the war | if the present congress will not admit them a congress can be formed of these southern senators and members of the house and of such northern senators and representatives as will believe that i am right and acting under the constitution | as president of the united states i will recognize that congress and communicate with them as such | as general of the army i want your support | general grant replied: that will create civil war because the north will undoubtedly recognize the congress as it now exists and that congress will assert itself in every way possible |  in that case said the president i want the to support the constitutional congress which i am recognizing | general grant said: on the contrary so far as my authority goes the army will support the congress as it is now and disperse the other | president johnson then ordered general grant to mexico on a mission and as he had no power to send a general of the army out of the united states grant refused to go | shortly afterwards grant received a very confidential communication from general sherman stating that he had been ordered to washington to take command of the army and wanted to know what it meant | general grant explained the situation whereupon general sherman announced to the president that he would take exactly the same position as general grant had | the president then dropped the whole subject |iii  abraham lincoln the secretaryship of the state of new york is a very delightful office | its varied duties are agreeable and the incumbent is brought in close contact with the state administration the legislature and the people | we had in the secretary of state's office at the time i held the office about fifty eight years ago very interesting archives | the office had been the repository of these documents since the organization of the government | many years afterwards they were removed to the state library | among these documents were ten volumes of autograph letters from general washington to governor clinton and others covering the campaign on the hudson in the effort by the enemy to capture west point the treason of arnold and nearly the whole of the revolutionary war | in the course of years before these papers were removed to the state library a large part of them disappeared | it was not the fault of the administration succeeding me but it was because the legislature in its effort to economize refused to make appropriation for the proper care of these invaluable historic papers | most of washington's letters were written entirely in his own hand and one wonders at the phenomenal industry which enabled him to do so much writing while continuously and laboriously engaged in active campaigning | in view of the approaching presidential election the legislature passed a law which was signed by the governor providing machinery for the soldiers' vote | new york had at that time between three and four hundred thousand soldiers in the field who were scattered in companies regiments brigades and divisions all over the south | this law made it the duty of the secretary of state to provide ballots to see that they reached every unit of a company to gather the votes and transmit them to the home of each soldier | the state government had no machinery by which this work could be done | i applied to the express companies but all refused on the ground that they were not equipped | i then sent for old john butterfield who was the founder of the express business but had retired and was living on his farm near utica | he was intensely patriotic and ashamed of the lack of enterprise shown by the express companies | he said to me: if they cannot do this work they ought to retire | he at once organized what was practically an express company taking in all those in existence and adding many new features for the sole purpose of distributing the ballots and gathering the soldiers' votes | it was a gigantic task and successfully executed by this patriotic old gentleman | of course the first thing was to find out where the new york troops were and for that purpose i went to washington remaining there for several months before the war department would give me the information | the secretary of war was edwin m stanton | it was perhaps fortunate that the secretary of war should not only possess extraordinary executive ability but be also practically devoid of human weakness that he should be a rigid disciplinarian and administer justice without mercy | it was thought at the time that these qualities were necessary to counteract as far as possible the tender heartedness of president lincoln | if the boy condemned to be shot or his mother or father could reach the president in time he was never executed | the military authorities thought that this was a mistaken charity and weakened discipline | i was at a dinner after the war with a number of generals who had been in command of armies | the question was asked one of the most famous of these generals: how did you carry out the sentences of your courts martial and escape lincoln's pardons | the grim old warrior answered: i shot them first | i took my weary way every day to the war department but could get no results | the interviews were brief and disagreeable and the secretary of war very brusque | the time was getting short | i said to the secretary: if the ballots are to be distributed in time i must have information at once | he very angrily refused and said: new york troops are in every army all over the enemy's territory | to state their location would be to give invaluable information to the enemy | how do i know if that information would be so safeguarded as not to get out | as i was walking down the long corridor which was full of hurrying officers and soldiers returning from the field or departing for it i met elihu b washburne who was a congressman from illinois and an intimate friend of the president | he stopped me and said: hello mr secretary you seem very much troubled | can i help you | i told him my story |  what are you going to do | he asked | i answered: to protect myself i must report to the people of new york that the provision for the soldiers' voting cannot be carried out because the administration refuses to give information where the new york soldiers are located |  why said mr washburne that would beat mr lincoln | you don't know him | while he is a great statesman he is also the keenest of politicians alive | if it could be done in no other way the president would take a carpet bag and go around and collect those votes himself | you remain here until you hear from me | i will go at once and see the president | in about an hour a staff officer stepped up to me and asked: are you the secretary of state of new york | i answered yes |  the secretary of war wishes to see you at once he said | i found the secretary most cordial and charming |  mr secretary what do you desire | he asked | i stated the case as i had many times before and he gave a peremptory order to one of his staff that i should receive the documents in time for me to leave washington on the midnight train | the magical transformation was the result of a personal visit of president lincoln to the secretary of war | mr lincoln carried the state of new york by a majority of only 6 749 and it was a soldiers' vote that gave him the empire state | the compensations of my long delay in washington trying to move the war department were the opportunity it gave me to see mr lincoln to meet the members of the cabinet to become intimate with the new york delegation in congress and to hear the wonderful adventures and stories so numerous in washington | the white house of that time had no executive offices as now and the machinery for executive business was very primitive | the east half of the second story had one large reception room in which the president could always be found and a few rooms adjoining for his secretaries and clerks | the president had very little protection or seclusion | in the reception room which was always crowded at certain hours could be found members of congress office seekers and an anxious company of fathers and mothers seeking pardons for their sons condemned for military offenses or asking permission to go to the front where a soldier boy was wounded or sick | every one wanted something and wanted it very bad | the patient president wearied as he was with cares of state with the situation on several hostile fronts with the exigencies in congress and jealousies in his cabinet patiently and sympathetically listened to these tales of want and woe | my position was unique | i was the only one in washington who personally did not want anything my mission being purely in the public interest | i was a devoted follower of mr seward the secretary of state and through the intimacies with officers in his department i learned from day to day the troubles in the cabinet so graphically described in the diary of the secretary of the navy gideon welles | the antagonism between mr seward and mr chase the secretary of the treasury though rarely breaking out in the open was nevertheless acute | mr seward was devoted to the president and made every possible effort to secure his renomination and election | mr chase was doing his best to prevent mr lincoln's renomination and secure it for himself | no president ever had a cabinet of which the members were so independent had so large individual followings and were so inharmonious | the president's sole ambition was to secure the ablest men in the country for the departments which he assigned to them without regard to their loyalty to himself | one of mr seward's secretaries would frequently report to me the acts of disloyalty or personal hostility on the part of mr chase with the lament: the old man meaning lincoln knows all about it and will not do a thing | i had a long and memorable interview with the president | as i stepped from the crowd in his reception room he said to me: what do you want | i answered: nothing mr president i only came to pay my respects and bid you good by as i am leaving washington |  it is such a luxury he then remarked to find a man who does not want anything | i wish you would wait until i get rid of this crowd | when we were alone he threw himself wearily on a lounge and was evidently greatly exhausted | then he indulged rocking backward and forward in a reminiscent review of different crises in his administration and how he had met them | in nearly every instance he had carried his point and either captured or beaten his adversaries by a story so apt so on all fours and such complete answers that the controversy was over | i remember eleven of these stories each of which was a victory | in regard to this story telling he said: i am accused of telling a great many stories | they say that it lowers the dignity of the presidential office but i have found that plain people repeating with emphasis plain people take them as you find them are more easily influenced by a broad and humorous illustration than in any other way and what the hypercritical few may think i don't care | in speaking mr lincoln had a peculiar cadence in his voice caused by laying emphasis upon the key word of the sentence | in answer to the question how he knew so many anecdotes he answered: i never invented story but i have a good memory and i think tell one tolerably well | my early life was passed among pioneers who had the courage and enterprise to break away from civilization and settle in the wilderness | the things which happened to these original people and among themselves in their primitive conditions were far more dramatic than anything invented by the professional story tellers | for many years i travelled the circuit as a lawyer and usually there was only one hotel in the county towns where court was held | the judge the grand and petit juries the lawyers the clients and witnesses would pass the night telling exciting or amusing occurrences and these were of infinite variety and interest | he was always eager for a new story to add to his magazine of ammunition and weapons | one night when there was a reception at the executive mansion rufus f andrews surveyor of the port of new york and i went there together | andrews was a good lawyer and had been a correspondent in new york of mr lincoln while he was active at the bar in illinois | he was a confidential adviser of the president on new york matters and frequently at the executive mansion | as the procession moved past the president he stopped andrews and leaning over spoke very confidentially to him | the conversation delayed the procession for some time | when andrews and i returned to the hotel our rooms were crowded with newspaper men and politicians wanting to know what the confidential conversation was about | andrews made a great mystery of it and so did the press | he explained to me when we were alone that during his visit to the president the night before he told the president a new story | the president delayed him at the reception saying: andrews i forgot the point of that story you told me last night repeat it now | while mr lincoln had the most logical of minds and his letters and speeches on political controversies were the most convincing of any statesman of his period he rarely would enter into a long discussion in conversation he either would end the argument by an apt story or illustration enforcing his ideas | john ganson of buffalo was the leader of the bar in western new york | though elected to the house of representatives as a democrat he supported the war measures of the administration | he was a gentleman of the old school of great dignity and always immaculately dressed | he was totally bald and his face also devoid of hair | it was a gloomy period of the war and the reports from the front very discouraging | congressman ganson felt it his duty to see the president about the state of the country | he made a formal call and said to mr lincoln: though i am a democrat i imperil my political future by supporting your war measures | i can understand that secrecy may be necessary in military operations but i think i am entitled to know the exact conditions good or bad at the front | mr lincoln looked at him earnestly for a minute and then said: ganson how clean you shave | that ended the interview | the first national convention i ever attended was held in baltimore in 1864 when mr lincoln was renominated | i have since been four times a delegate at large representing the whole state and many times a delegate representing a congressional district | judge w h robertson of westchester county and i went to the convention together | we thought we would go by sea but our ship had a collision and we were rescued by a pilot boat | returning to new york we decided to accept the security of the railroad | judge robertson was one of the shrewdest and ablest of the republican politicians in the state of new york | he had been repeatedly elected county judge state senator and member of congress and always overcoming a hostile democratic majority | we went to washington to see mr seward first had an interview with him at his office and dined with him in the evening | to dine with secretary seward was an event which no one and especially a young politician ever forgot | he was the most charming of hosts and his conversation a liberal education | there was no division as to the renomination of mr lincoln but it was generally conceded that the vice president should be a war democrat | the candidacy of daniel s dickinson of new york had been so ably managed that he was far and away the favorite | he had been all his life up to the breaking out of the civil war one of the most pronounced extreme and radical democrats in the state of new york | mr seward took judge robertson and me into his confidence | he was hostile to the nomination of mr dickinson and said that the situation demanded the nomination for vice president of a representative from the border states whose loyalty had been demonstrated during the war | he eulogized andrew johnson of tennessee and gave a glowing description of the courage and patriotism with which johnson at the risk of his life had advocated the cause of the union and kept his state partially loyal | he said to us: you can quote me to the delegates and they will believe i express the opinion of the president | while the president wishes to take no part in the nomination for vice president yet he favors mr |johnson  when we arrived at the convention this interview with mr seward made us a centre of absorbing interest and at once changed the current of opinion which before that had been almost unanimously for mr dickinson | it was finally left to the new york delegation | the meeting of the delegates from new york was a stormy one and lasted until nearly morning | mr dickinson had many warm friends especially among those of previous democratic affiliation and the state pride to have a vice president was in his favor | upon the final vote andrew johnson had one majority | the decision of new york was accepted by the convention and he was nominated for vice president | this is an instance of which i have met many in my life where the course of history was changed on a very narrow margin | political histories and the newspapers' discussions of the time assigned the success of mr johnson to the efforts of several well known delegates but really it was largely if not wholly due to the message of mr seward which was carried by judge robertson and myself to the delegates | the year of 1864 was full of changes of popular sentiment and surprises | the north had become very tired of the war | the people wanted peace and peace at almost any price | jacob thompson and clement c clay ex united states senators from the south appeared at niagara falls on the canadian side and either they or their friends gave out that they were there to treat for peace | in reference to them mr lincoln said to me: this effort was to inflame the peace sentiment of the north to embarrass the administration and to demoralize the army and in a way it was successful | mr greeley was hammering at me to take action for peace and said that unless i met these men every drop of blood that was shed and every dollar that was spent i would be responsible for that it would be a blot upon my conscience and soul | i wrote a letter to mr greeley and said to him that those two ex united states senators were whigs and old friends of his personally and politically and that i desired him to go to niagara falls and find out confidentially what their credentials were and let me know | the president stated that instead of mr greeley doing it that way he went there as an ambassador and with an array of reporters established himself on the american side and opened negotiations with these two alleged envoys across the bridge | continuing mr lincoln said: i had reason to believe from confidential information which i had received from a man i trusted and who had interviewed jefferson davis the president of the confederacy that these envoys were without authority because president davis had said to this friend of mine and of his that he would treat on no terms whatever but on absolute recognition of the independence of the southern confederacy | the attention of the whole country and of the army centred on these negotiations at niagara falls and to stop the harm they were doing i recalled mr greeley and issued my proclamation 'to whom it may concern ' in which i stated if there was anybody or any delegation at niagara falls or anywhere else authorized to represent the southern confederacy and to treat for peace they had free conduct and safety to washington and return | of course they never came because their mission was a subterfuge | but they made greeley believe in them and the result is that he is still attacking me for needlessly prolonging the war for purposes of my own | at a cabinet meeting one of the members said to mr lincoln: mr president why don't you write a letter to the public stating these facts and that will end mr greeley's attacks | the president answered: mr greeley owns a daily newspaper a very widely circulated and influential one | i have no newspaper | the press of the country would print my letter and so would the new york tribune | in a little while the public would forget all about it and then mr greeley would begin to prove from my own letter that he was right and i of course would be helpless to reply | he brought the cabinet around to unanimous agreement with him by telling one of his characteristic stories | this affair and the delays in the prosecution of the war had created a sentiment early in 1864 that the re election of mr lincoln was impossible | the leaders of both the conservative and the radical elements in the republican party mr weed on the one hand and mr greeley on the other frankly told the president that he could not be re elected and his intimate friend congressman elihu b washburne after a canvass of the country gave him the same information | then came the spectacular victory of farragut at mobile and the triumphant march of sherman through georgia and the sentiment of the country entirely changed | there was an active movement on foot in the interest of the secretary of the treasury chase and fostered by him to hold an independent convention before the regular republican convention as a protest against the renomination of mr lincoln | it was supported by some of the most eminent and powerful members of the party who threw into the effort their means and influence | after these victories the effort was abandoned and mr lincoln was nominated by acclamation | i recall as one of the excitements and pleasures of a lifetime the enthusiastic confidence of that convention when they acclaimed lincoln their nominee | governor seymour who was the idol of his party headed the new york delegation to the national democratic convention to nominate the president and his journey to that convention was a triumphal march | there is no doubt that at the time he had with him not only the enthusiastic support of his own party but the confidence of the advocates of peace | his own nomination and election seemed inevitable | however in deference to the war sentiment general mcclellan was nominated instead and here occurred one of those little things which so often in our country have turned the tide | the platform committee and the convention afterwards permitted to go into the platform a phrase proposed by clement c vallandigham of ohio the phrase being the war is a failure | soon after the adjournment of the convention to the victories of farragut and sherman was added the spectacular campaign and victory of sheridan in the valley of shenandoah | the campaign at once took on a new phase | it was the opportunity for the orator | it is difficult now to recreate the scenes of that campaign | the people had been greatly disheartened | every family was in bereavement with a son lost and others still in the service | taxes were onerous and economic and business conditions very bad | then came this reaction which seemed to promise an early victory for the union | the orator naturally picked up the phrase the war is a failure then he pictured farragut tied to the shrouds of his flag ship then he portrayed grant's victories in the mississippi campaign hooker's battle above the clouds the advance of the army of cumberland then he enthusiastically described sheridan leaving the war department hearing of the battle in shenandoah valley speeding on and rallying his defeated troops reforming and leading them to victory and finished with reciting some of the stirring war poems | mr lincoln's election under the conditions and circumstances was probably more due to that unfortunate phrase in the democratic platform than to any other cause | the tragedy of the assassination of mr lincoln was followed by the most pathetic incident of american life his funeral | after the ceremony at washington the funeral train stopped at philadelphia new york and albany | in each of these cities was an opportunity for the people to view the remains | i had charge in my official capacity as secretary of state of the train after it left albany | it was late in the evening when we started and the train was running all night through central and western new york | its schedule was well known along the route | wherever the highway crossed the railway track the whole population of the neighborhood was assembled on the highway and in the fields | huge bonfires lighted up the scene | pastors of the local churches of all denominations had united in leading their congregations for greeting and farewell for their beloved president | as we would reach a crossing there sometimes would be hundreds and at others thousands of men women and children on their knees praying and singing hymns | this continuous service of prayer and song and supplication lasted over the three hundred miles between albany and buffalo from midnight until dawn |iv  general grant the fairies who distribute the prizes are practical jokers | i have known thousands who sought office some for its distinction some for its emoluments and some for both thousands who wanted promotion from places they held and other thousands who wanted to regain positions they had lost all of whom failed in their search | i probably would have been in one of those classes if i had been seeking an office | i was determined however upon a career in railroad work until if possible i had reached its highest rewards | during that period i was offered about a dozen political appointments most of them of great moment and very tempting all of which i declined | near the close of president grant's administration george jones at that time the proprietor and publisher of the new york times asked me to come and see him | mr jones in his association with the brilliant editor henry j raymond had been a progressive and staying power of the financial side of this great journal | he was of welsh descent a very hardheaded practical and wise business man | he also had very definite views on politics and parties and several times nearly wrecked his paper by obstinately pursuing a course which was temporarily unpopular with its readers and subscribers | i was on excellent terms with mr jones and admired him | the new york times became under his management one of the severest critics of general grant's administration and of the president himself | i went to his house and during the conversation jones said to me: i was very much surprised to receive a letter from the president asking me to come and see him at the white house | of course i went anticipating a disagreeable interview but it turned out absolutely the reverse | the president was most cordial and his frankness most attractive | after a long and full discussion the president said the times had been his most unsparing critic but he was forced to agree with much the times said that he had sent for me to make a request that he had come to the presidency without any preparation whatever for its duties or for civic responsibilities that he was compelled to take the best advice he could find and surround himself with men many of whom he had never met before and they were his guides and teachers that he however assumed the entire responsibility for everything he had done | he knew perfectly well in the retrospect and with the larger experience he had gained that he had made many mistakes | 'and now mr jones ' he continued 'i have sent for you as the most powerful as well as i think the fairest of my critics to ask that you will say in your final summing up of my eight years that however many my errors or mistakes they were faults of judgment and that i acted conscientiously and in any way i thought was right and best '|  i told the president i would be delighted to take that view in the times | then the president said that he would like to show his appreciation in some way which would be gratifying to me | i told him that i wanted nothing for myself nor did any of my friends in the line of patronage | then he said he wanted my assistance because he was looking for the best man for united states district attorney for the district of new york | with my large acquaintance he thought that i should be able to tell him whom among the lawyers would be best to appoint | after a little consideration i recommended you |  the president then said: 'mr | depew supported greeley and though he is back in the party and doing good service in the campaigns i do not like those men | nevertheless you can tender him the office and ask for his immediate acceptance ' | i told mr jones what my determination was in regard to a career and while appreciating most highly both his own friendship and the compliment from the president i must decline | general grant's mistakes in his presidency arose from his possession of one of the greatest of virtues and that is loyalty to one's friends | he had unlimited confidence in them and could not see or be made to see nor listen to any of their defects | he was himself of such transparent honesty and truthfulness that he gauged and judged others by his own standard | scandals among a few of the officials of his administration were entirely due to this great quality | his intimacy among his party advisers fell among the most extreme of organization men and political machinists | when under the advice of senator conkling he appointed thomas murphy collector of the port of new york it was charged in the press that the collector removed employees at the rate of several hundred per day and filled their places with loyal supporters of the organization | this policy which was a direct reversal of the ideas of civil service reform which were then rapidly gaining strength incurred the active hostility of civil service reformers of whom george william curtis was the most conspicuous | when general grant came to reside in new york after his tour around the world he was overwhelmed with social attentions | i met him at dinners several times a week and was the victim of a characteristic coldness of manner which he had towards many people | one st patrick's day while in washington i received an earnest telegraphic request from judge john t brady and his brother in law judge charles p daly president of the society of the friendly sons of st patrick saying: the sons are to have their greatest celebration because they are to be honored by the presence of general grant who will also speak and it is imperative that you come and help us welcome him | i arrived at the dinner late and passed in front of the dais to my seat at the other end while general grant was speaking | he was not easy on his feet at that time though afterwards he became very felicitous in public speaking | he paused a moment until i was seated and then said: if chauncey depew stood in my shoes and i in his i would be a much happier man | i immediately threw away the speech i had prepared during the six hours' trip from washington and proceeded to make a speech on who can stand now or in the future in the shoes of general grant | i had plenty of time before my turn came to elaborate this idea gradually eliminating contemporary celebrities until in the future the outstanding figure representing the period would be the hero of our civil war and the restoration of the union | the enthusiasm of the audience as the speech went on surpassed anything i ever saw | they rushed over tables and tried to carry the general around the room | when the enthusiasm had subsided he came to me and with much feeling said: thank you for that speech it is the greatest and most eloquent that i ever heard | he insisted upon my standing beside him when he received the families of the members and took me home in his carriage | from that time until his death he was most cordial and at many dinners would insist upon my being assigned to a chair next to him | among strangers and in general conversation general grant was the most reticent of men but among those whom he knew a most entertaining conversationalist | he went over a wide field on such occasions and was interesting on all subjects and especially instructive on military campaigns and commanders | he gave me as his judgment that among all the military geniuses of the world the greatest was general philip sheridan and that sheridan's grasp of a situation had no parallel in any great general of whom he knew | i was with general grant at his home the day before he went from new york to mount mcgregor near saratoga where he died | i learned of the trip and went immediately to see him and was met by his son general frederick d grant | i said to him: i learn that your father is going to mount mcgregor to morrow and i have come to tender him a special train | after all the necessary arrangements had been made he asked me to go in and see the general | before doing this i asked: how is he |  well he answered he is dying but it is of infinite relief to him to see people whom he knows and likes and i know he wants to see you | our effort is to keep his mind off from himself and interest him with anything which we think will be of relief to him and if you have any new incidents do not fail to tell him | when i entered the room the general was busy writing his memoirs | he greeted me very cordially said he was glad to see me and then remarked: i see by the papers that you have been recently up at hartford delivering a lecture | tell me about it | in reply i told him about a very interesting journey there the lecture and supper afterwards with mark twain as the presiding genius concerning all of which he asked questions wanting more particulars and the whole story seemed to interest him | what seemed to specially please him was the incident when i arrived at the hotel after the supper given me at the close of my lecture | it was about three o'clock in the morning and i went immediately to bed leaving a call for the early train to new york | at five o'clock there was violent rapping on the door and upon opening it an irish waiter stood there with a tray on which were a bottle of champagne and a goblet of ice |  you have made a mistake i said to the waiter |  no sir he answered i could not make a mistake about you |  who sent this | i asked |  the committee sir with positive instructions that you should have it at five o'clock in the morning he answered |  well my friend i said is it the habit of the good people of hartford when they have decided to go to new york on an early train to drink a bottle of champagne at five o'clock in the morning | he answered: most of them do sir |  nobody at that time had dreamed of the eighteenth amendment and the volstead law | with a smile general grant then said: well there are some places in connecticut where that could not be done as local option prevails and the towns have gone dry | for instance my friend senator nye of nevada spoke through connecticut in my interest in the last campaign | nye was a free liver though not a dissipated man and as you know a very excellent speaker | he told me that when he arrived at one of the principal manufacturing towns he was entertained by the leading manufacturer at his big house and in magnificent style | the dinner was everything that could be desired except that the only fluid was ice water | after a long speech nye on returning to the house had a reception and the supper was still dry except plenty of ice water |  nye completely exhausted went to bed but could not sleep nor could he find any stimulants | so about six o'clock in the morning he dressed and wandered down to the dining room | the head of the house came in and seeing him exclaimed: 'why senator you are up early '| nye replied: 'yes you know out in nevada we have a great deal of malaria and i could not sleep '| 'well ' said the host 'this is a temperance town | we find it an excellent thing for the working people and especially for the young men but we have some malaria here also and for that i have a private remedy '| whereupon he went to a closet and pulled out a bottle of brandy |  after his host had left nye continued there in a refreshed and more enjoyable spirit | soon his hostess came in and much surprised said: 'why senator you are up early '| 'yes ' he said 'out in nevada we have a great deal of malaria and while i am on these speaking tours i have sharp attacks and cannot sleep | i had one last night '|  'well ' she remarked 'this is a temperance town and it is a good thing for the working people and the young men but i have a touch of malaria now and then myself '| then she went to the tea caddy and pulled out a bottle of brandy | the senator by this time was in perfect harmony with himself and the whole world |  when the boys came in sons of the entertainer they said: 'senator we hear that you are an expert on livestock horses cattle etc | won't you come out in the barn so we can show you some we regard as very fine specimens '| the boys took him out to the barn shut the door locked it and whispered: 'senator we have no live stock but we have a bottle here in the hay mow which we think will do you good '| and the senator wound up his narrative by saying: 'the wettest place that i know of is a dry town in connecticut ' | the next day general grant went to mount mcgregor and as we all know a few days afterwards he lost his voice completely | v roscoe conkling for a number of years instead of taking my usual vacation in travel or at some resort i spent a few weeks in the fall in the political canvass as a speaker | in the canvass of 1868 i was associated with senator roscoe conkling who desired an assistant as the mass meetings usually wanted at least two and probably three hours of speaking and he limited himself to an hour | general grant was at the height of his popularity and the audiences were enormous | as we had to speak every day and sometimes several times a day mr conkling notified the committees that he would not speak out of doors and that they must in all cases provide a hall | when we arrived at lockport n y the chairman of the committee burt van horn who was the congressman from the district told the senator that at least twenty thousand people from the town and others coming from the country on excursion trains had filled the fair grounds | conkling became very angry and told the congressman that he knew perfectly well the conditions under which he came to lockport and that he would not speak at the fair grounds | a compromise was finally effected by which the senator was to appear upon the platform the audience be informed that he would speak in the opera house and i was to be left to take care of the crowd | the departure of the senator from the grounds was very dramatic | he was enthusiastically applauded and a band preceded his carriage | for some reason i never had such a success as in addressing that audience | commencing with a story which was new and effective i continued for two hours without apparently losing an auditor | upon my return to the hotel i found the senator very indignant | he said that he had gone to the opera house with the committee that of course no meeting had been advertised there but a band had been placed on the balcony to play as if it were a dime museum attraction inside that a few farmers' wives had straggled in to have an opportunity to partake from their baskets their luncheons and that he had left the opera house and returned to the hotel | the committee coming in and narrating what had occurred at the fair grounds did not help his imperious temper | the committee begged for a large meeting which was to be held in the evening but conkling refused and ordered me to do the same and we left on the first train | the cordial relations which had existed up to that time were somehow severed and he became very hostile | general grant as president of course never had had experience or opportunity to know anything of practical politics | it was said that prior to his election he had never voted but once and that was before the war when he voted the democratic ticket for james buchanan | all the senators representatives and public men who began to press around him seeking the appointment to office of their friends were unknown to him personally | he decided rapidly whom among them he could trust and once having arrived at that conclusion his decision was irrevocable | he would stand by a friend without regard to its effect upon himself to the last ditch | of course each of the two united states senators conkling and fenton wanted his exclusive favor | it is impossible to conceive of two men so totally different in every characteristic | grant liked conkling as much as he disliked fenton | the result was that he transferred the federal patronage of the state to senator conkling | conkling was a born leader very autocratic and dictatorial | he immediately began to remove fenton officials and to replace them with members of his own organization | as there was no civil service at that time and public officers were necessarily active politicians senator conkling in a few years destroyed the organization which fenton had built up as governor and became master of the republican party in the state | the test came at the state convention at saratoga | senator conkling at that time had become hostile to me why i do not know nor could his friends who were most of them mine also find out | he directed that i must not be elected a delegate to the convention | the collector of the port of new york in order to make that decree effective filled my district in westchester county with appointees from the custom house | patronage when its control is subject to a popular vote is a boomerang | she went as a girl from te hua to ah ko for study with the medicine people of one order there | one night it was as if she go into the earth or up in the sky | no one ever see her any more | it was the year of the fire of the star across the sky | the result of the appeal was overwhelming and when the district convention met the custom house did not have a single delegate | the leader of the custom house crowd came to me and said: this is a matter of bread and butter and living with us | it is nothing to you | these delegates are against us and for you at the convention | now we have devised a plan to save our lives | it is that the three delegates elected shall all be friends of yours | you shall apparently be defeated | a resolution will be passed that if either delegate fails to attend or resigns the other two may fill the vacancy | one of these will resign when the convention meets and you will be substituted in his place | in the meantime we will send out through the associated press that you have been defeated | i did not have the heart to see these poor fellows dismissed from their employment and i assented to the proposition | when we arrived at the convention governor cornell then state chairman called to order | i arose to make a motion when he announced: you sir are not a member of this convention | my credentials however under the arrangement made in westchester convinced him that he was misinformed | the conkling side selected for their chairman andrew d white and the other side selected me | upon careful canvass of the votes we had a clear majority | there were several delegations which were controlled by federal office holders | it is at this point that patronage becomes overwhelmingly effective | several of those office holders were shown telegrams from washington which meant their removal unless they did as directed by senator conkling | when the convention met the next day the office holders kept their heads on their shoulders and my dear and valued old friend andrew d white was elected chairman of the convention | i asked the leader of the federal crowd from westchester how he explained my getting into the convention |  oh he said that was easy | our people gained so many delegates by offers of patronage and threats of removal that when i told them you had bought my delegates away from me they believed it without question and we are all safe in our places in the custom house | my success was entirely due to the farmers' indignation at federal dictation and the campaign did not cost me a dollar | roscoe conkling was created by nature for a great career | that he missed it was entirely his own fault | physically he was the handsomest man of his time | his mental equipment nearly approached genius | he was industrious to a degree | his oratorical gifts were of the highest order and he was a debater of rare power and resources | but his intolerable egotism deprived him of vision necessary for supreme leadership | with all his oratorical power and his talent in debate he made little impression upon the country and none upon posterity | his position in the senate was a masterful one and on the platform most attractive but none of his speeches appear in the schoolbooks or in the collections of great orations | the reason was that his wonderful gifts were wholly devoted to partisan discussions and local issues | his friends regarded his philippic against george w curtis at the republican state convention at rochester as the high water mark of his oratory | i sat in the seat next to mr curtis when conkling delivered his famous attack | his admirers thought this the best speech he ever made and it certainly was a fine effort emphasized by oratory of a high order and it was received by them with the wildest enthusiasm and applause | the assault upon mr curtis was exceedingly bitter the denunciation very severe and every resource of sarcasm of which mr conkling was past master was poured upon the victim | his bitterness was caused by mr curtis's free criticism of him on various occasions | the speech lasted two hours and it was curious to note its effect upon mr curtis | under the rules which the convention had adopted he could not reply so he had to sit and take it | the only feeling or evidence of being hurt by his punishment was in exclamations at different points made by his assailant | they were: remarkable | extraordinary   what an exhibition |  bad temper |  very bad temper | in the long controversy between them mr curtis had the advantages which the journalist always possesses | the orator has one opportunity on the platform and the publication the next day in the press | the editor and mr curtis was at that time editor of harper's weekly can return every saturday and have an exclusive hearing by an audience limited only by the circulation of his newspaper and the quotations from it by journalistic friends | the speech illustrated conkling's methods of preparation | i used to hear from the senator's friends very frequently that he had added another phrase to his characterization of curtis | while he was a ready debater yet for an effort of this kind he would sometimes devote a year to going frequently over the ground and in each repetition produce new epigrams quotable phrases and characterizations | there used to be an employee of the state committee named lawrence | he was a man of a good deal of receptive intelligence and worshipped the senator | mr conkling discovered this quality and used lawrence as a target or listening post | i have often had lawrence come to my office and say: i had a great night | the senator talked to me or made speeches to me until nearly morning | he told me that he had heard every word of the curtis philippic many times | lawrence told me of another instance of conkling's preparation for a great effort | when he was preparing the speech which was to bring his friends who had been disappointed at the convention to the support of general garfield he summoned lawrence for clerical work at his home | lawrence said that the senator would write or dictate and then correct until he was satisfied with the effort and that this took considerable time | when it was completed he would take long walks into the country and in these walks recite the whole or part of his speech until he was perfect master of it | this speech took four hours in delivery in new york and he held the audience throughout this long period | john reed one of the editors of the new york times told me that he sat on the stage near conkling and had in his hands the proofs which had been set up in advance and which filled ten columns of his paper | he said that the senator neither omitted nor interpolated a word from the beginning to the end | he would frequently refer apparently to notes on his cuffs or little memoranda not that he needed them but it was the orator's always successful effort to create impression that his speech is extemporaneous and the audience much prefer a speech which they think is such | senator conkling held an important position in a critical period of our country's history | if his great powers had been devoted in the largest way to the national constructive problems of the time he would have been the leader of the dominant party and president of the united states | instead he became the leader of a faction in his own state only and by the merciless use of federal patronage absolutely controlled for twelve years the action of the state organization | all the young men who appeared in the legislature or in county offices who displayed talent for leadership independence and ambition were set aside | the result was remarkable | while prior to his time there were many men in public life in the state with national reputation and influence this process of elimination drove young men from politics into the professions or business and at the close of senator conkling's career there was hardly an active member of the republican party in new york of national reputation unless he had secured it before mr conkling became the autocrat of new york politics | the political machine in the republican party in his congressional district early in his career became jealous of his growing popularity and influence both at home and in congress | by machine methods they defeated him and thought they had retired him permanently from public life | when i was elected secretary of state i received a note from mr conkling asking if i would meet him | i answered: yes immediately and at albany | he came there with ward hunt afterwards one of the associate justices of the supreme court of the united states | he delivered an intense attack upon machine methods and machine politics and said they would end in the elimination of all independent thought in the crushing of all ambition in promising young men and ultimate infinite damage to the state and nation |  you he said are a very young man for your present position but you will soon be marked for destruction | then he stated what he wanted saying: i was defeated by the machine in the last election | they can defeat me now only by using one man of great talent and popularity in my district | i want you to make that man your deputy secretary of state | it is the best office in your gift and he will be entirely satisfied | i answered him: i have already received from the chiefs of the state organization designations for every place in my office and especially for that one but the appointment is yours and you may announce it at once | mr conkling arose as if addressing an audience and as he stood there in the little parlor of congress hall in albany he was certainly a majestic figure | he said: sir a thing that is quickly done is doubly done | hereafter as long as you and i both live there never will be a deposit in any bank personally politically or financially to my credit which will not be subject to your draft | the gentleman whom he named became my deputy | his name was erastus clark | he was a man of ability and very broad culture and was not only efficient in the performance of his duties but one of the most delightful of companions | his health was bad and his friends were always alarmed and justifiably so about him | nevertheless i met him years afterwards in washington when he was past eighty four | at mr conkling's request mr clark made an appointment for a mutual visit to trenton falls a charming resort near utica | we spent the week end there and i saw mr conkling at his best | he was charming in reminiscence in discussion in his characterization of the leading actors upon the public stage and in varying views of ambitions and careers | when the patronage all fell into his hands after the election of general grant he pressed upon me the appointment of postmaster of the city of new york | it was difficult for him to understand that while i enjoyed politics and took an active part in campaigns i would not accept any office whatever | he then appointed one of the best of postmasters who afterwards became postmaster general but who was also one of the most efficient of his lieutenants general thomas l james | when mr conkling was a candidate for united states senator i was regarded as a confidential friend of governor fenton | the governor was one of the most secretive of men and therefore i did not know his views to the candidate or whether he had preferences | i think he had no preferences but wished conkling defeated and at the same time did not want to take a position which would incur the enmity of him or his friends | one night there was a great public demonstration and being called upon i made a speech to the crowd which included the legislature to the effect that we had been voiceless in the united states senate too long that the greatest state in the union should be represented by a man who had demonstrated his ability to all and that man was mr conkling | it is marvellous that it should not have occurred to mr mill while he was writing this passage how comes this large number to be a 'whole' at all and how comes it that 'this whole ' with all its units can be written down by means of six digits | simply because of a conventional arrangement by which a single digit according to its position can express by one mark tens hundreds thousands c of units and thus can exhaust the sum by dealing with its items in large masses | but how can such a process exhaust the infinite | we should like to know how long mr mill thinks it would take to work out the following problem: if two figures can represent ten three a hundred four a thousand five ten thousand c find the number of figures required to represent infinity |  bb bb precisely the same misconception of hamilton's position occurs in professor de morgan's paper in the cambridge transactions to which we have previously referred | he speaks p | 13 of the notion which runs through many writers from descartes to hamilton that the mind must be big enough to hold all it can conceive | this notion is certainly not maintained by hamilton nor yet by descartes in the paragraph quoted by mr de morgan nor as far as we are aware in any other part of his works | infinite divisibility stands or falls with infinite extension | in both cases mr mill confounds infinity with indefiniteness | but with regard to an absolute minimum of space mr mill's argument requires a separate notice |  it is not denied he says that there is a portion of extension which to the naked eye appears an indivisible point it has been called by philosophers the minimum visibile | this minimum we can indefinitely magnify by means of optical instruments making visible the still smaller parts which compose it | in each successive experiment there is still a minimum visibile anything less than which cannot be discovered with that instrument but can with one of a higher power | suppose now that as we increase the magnifying power of our instruments and before we have reached the limit of possible increase we arrive at a stage at which that which seemed the smallest visible space under a given microscope does not appear larger under one which by its mechanical construction is adapted to magnify more but still remains apparently indivisible | i say that if this happened we should believe in a minimum of extension or if some priori metaphysical prejudice prevented us from believing it we should at least be enabled to conceive it p |84  the natural conclusion of most men under such circumstances would be that there was some fault in the microscope |vi  horace greeley while secretary of state of new york the decennial state census was taken and the appointment of three thousand census takers involved as much pressure from congressmen state senators assemblymen and local leaders as if the places had been very remunerative and permanent | i discovered what a power political patronage is in party organization because it developed that the appointment of this large number of men located in every town in the state could easily have been utilized for the formation of a personal organization within the party | i was exceedingly fond as i am still and always have been of political questions issues affecting the general government the state or localities party organizations and political leaders | so while devoted to my profession and its work and increasingly enjoying its labor and activities politics became an interesting recreation | with no desire for and with a determination not to take any public office to be called into party councils to be at an occasional meeting of the state committee and a delegate to conventions were happy relief and excursions from the routine of professional work as golf is to a tired business man or lawyer | the nomination of general grant for president by the republicans and of horatio seymour by the democrats had made new york the pivotal state in the national election | john t hoffman the most popular among the younger democrats was their nominee for governor | the republicans with great unanimity agreed upon john a griswold a congressman from the troy district | griswold was the idol of his colleagues in the new york delegation in congress and his attractive personality and demonstrated business ability had made him a great favorite with politicians business men and labor | the canvass for his nomination had been conducted with great ardor by enthusiastic friends in all parts of the state and the delegations were nearly all practically pledged to his nomination | no one dreamed that there would be an opposition candidate | on the train to the convention john russell young then managing editor of the new york tribune under mr greeley came to me and said: mr greeley has decided to be a candidate at the convention for the nomination for governor | you are his friend he lives in your assembly district in westchester county and wishes you to make the nomination speech | i tried to argue the question with young by portraying to him the situation and the utter hopelessness of any attempt to break the slate | he however insisted upon it saying that all pledges and preferences would disappear because of greeley's services to the party for so many years | when we arrived at syracuse and stated our determination to present mr greeley's name it was hilariously received as a joke | efforts were made by friends of greeley to persuade him not to undertake such an impossible task but they could produce no effect | mr griswold was put in nomination by mr demers one of the most eloquent young men in the ministry of the state and afterwards an editor of power and his speech filled every requirement | then i presented mr greeley | at first the audience was hostile but as the recital of the great editor's achievements grew in intensity and heat the convention began to applaud and then to cheer | a delegate hurled at me the question: how about greeley signing the bail of jefferson davis | the sentiment seemed to change at once and cheers were followed by hisses | then there was supreme silence and i immediately shouted: there are spots on the sun | the effect was electrical | delegates were on their feet standing on chairs the air was full of hats and the cheers deafening for greeley for some minutes | mr demers the preacher delegate lost his equilibrium rushed up to me shaking his fist excitedly and shouted: damn you | you have nominated him and beaten griswold | a recess was taken and when the convention reconvened the ballot demonstrated that if the organization is given time it can always reform its shattered lines and show the efficiency of discipline | when i met mr greeley soon after he said: i cannot understand why i desired the nomination for governor nor why anybody should want the office | there is nothing in it | no man now can name the ten last governors of the state of new york | having tried that proposition many times since on the average citizen i have found that mr greeley was absolutely right | any one who does not think so can try to solve that problem himself | the meeting of the electoral college at the capitol at albany in 1864 was one of the most picturesque and interesting gatherings ever held in the state | people came from all parts of the country to witness the formality of the casting of the vote of new york for abraham lincoln | the members of the college were most of them men of great distinction in our public and civic life | horace greeley was elected president of the college | the meeting was held in the senate chamber | when mr greeley took the chair the desk in front of him made only his bust visible and with his wonderfully intellectual face his long gray hair brushed back and his solemn and earnest expression he was one of the most impressive figures i ever saw occupying the chair as a presiding officer | one of the electors had failed to appear | most of us knew that under pressure of great excitement he was unable to resist his convivial tendencies but no one supposed that mr greeley could by any possibility know of his weakness | after waiting some time one of the electors moved that the college take a recess for half a day | mr greeley turned very pale and before putting the question made a little speech something like this in a voice full of emotion i might almost say tears: my brethren we are met here upon the most solemn occasion of our lives in this crisis of the republic | upon the regularity of what we do here this day may depend whether the republic lives or dies | i would therefore suggest that we sit here in silence until our absent brother who is doubtless kept from us by some good reason shall appear and take his seat | the effect of this address upon the electoral college and the surrounding audience was great | many were in tears and the women spectators most of whom were in mourning for those lost during the war were all crying | as secretary of state it was my duty to have the papers all prepared for execution as soon as the college had voted and to attach to them the great seal of the state and then they were sent by special messenger to washington to be delivered to the house of representatives | mr greeley at the opening of the session said to me: chauncey as i am not very familiar with parliamentary law i wish you would take a seat on the steps beside me here so that i can consult you if necessary | after this effective and affecting speech he leaned down until he was close to my ear and said: chauncey how long do you think it will be before that d drunken fool will be able to return and take his seat | general grant's administration soon aroused great opposition | carl schurz charles francis adams and other leaders became very hostile to the administration and to a second term | the country was longing for peace | the carpet bag governments of the south were full of corruption and incompetence and imposed upon the southern states intolerable burdens of debt | the feeling was becoming general that there should be universal amnesty in order that the best and most capable people of the south could return to the management of their own affairs | this led to the calling of a convention of the republicans which nominated horace greeley for president | i had no desire nor the slightest intention of being involved in this controversy but was happily pursuing my profession with increasing fondness for private life | one day commodore vanderbilt who had a strong friendship for mr greeley but took no interest in politics said to me: mr greeley has been to see me and is very anxious for you to assist him | if you can aid him in any way i wish you would | afterwards mr greeley called at my house |  chauncey he said he always called me chauncey as you know i have been nominated by the liberal republican convention for president of the united states | if i can get the indorsement of the democratic party my election is assured | my democratic friends tell me that in order to accomplish that i must demonstrate that i have a substantial republican following | so we have called a meeting at rochester which is the capital of the strongest republican counties of the state | it is necessary to have for the principal speaker some republican of state and national reputation | i have selected you for that purpose | to my protest that i did not wish to enter into the contest nor to take any part in active politics he said very indignantly: i have supported you in my paper and personally during the whole of your career | i thought that if anybody was capable of gratitude it is you and i have had unfortunate experiences with many | i never was able to resist an appeal of this kind so i said impulsively: mr greeley i will go | the meeting was a marvellous success for the purpose for which it was called | it was purely a republican gathering | the crowd was several times larger than the hall could accommodate | henry r selden one of the judges of the court of appeals and one of the most eminent and respected republicans of the state presided | the two hundred vice presidents and secretaries upon the platform i had known intimately for years as republican leaders of their counties and districts | the demonstration so impressed the democratic state leaders that at the national democratic convention mr greeley was indorsed | there were two state conventions held simultaneously that year one democratic and one liberal republican | in the division of offices the democratic party being the larger was given the governorship and the liberal republicans had the lieutenant governorship | i was elected as the presiding officer of the liberal republican convention and also was made unanimously its nominee for lieutenant governor | the democratic convention nominated francis kernan one of the most distinguished lawyers of the state and afterwards united states senator | if the election had been held early in the canvass there is little doubt but that mr greeley would have carried the state by an overwhelming majority | his difficulty was that for a quarter of a century as editor of the new york tribune he had been the most merciless bitter and formidable critic and opponent of the democratic party | the deep seated animosity against him was fully aroused as the campaign proceeded by a propaganda which placed in the hands of every democrat these former slashing editorials of the new york tribune | their effect upon the democratic voters was evident after a while and when in the september election north carolina went republican a great mass of republicans who had made up their minds to support mr greeley went back to their party and he was overwhelmingly defeated | in the early part of his canvass mr greeley made a tour of the country | there have been many such travels by presidential candidates but none like this | his march was a triumphal procession and his audiences enormous and most enthusiastic | the whole country marvelled at his intellectual versatility | he spoke every day and often several times a day and each speech was absolutely new | there seemed to be no limit to his originality his freshness or the new angles from which to present the issues of the canvass | no candidate was ever so bitterly abused and so slandered | a veteran speaker has in the course of his career original experiences | the cordiality and responsiveness of his audience is not always an index of their agreement with his argument | during the campaign mr greeley came to me and said: i have received encouraging accounts from the state of maine | i have a letter from such a place naming it from the principal of the academy there | he writes me that the congregational minister who has the largest church in town the bank president the manufacturer the principal lawyer and himself are lifelong readers of the tribune and those steadfast republicans intend to support me | he thinks if they can have a public meeting with a speaker of national reputation the result might be an overturn in my favor in this community which is almost unanimously republican that it may influence the whole state and continued mr greeley he suggests you as the speaker and i earnestly ask you to go | when i arrived at the place i was entertained by the manufacturer | the audience crowded the largest hall in the town | the principal of the academy presided the congregational minister opened the exercises with a prayer and i was introduced and received with great cordiality | for such an audience my line of talk was praising general grant as the greatest general of modern times and how largely the preservation of the union depended upon his military genius | then to picture the tremendous responsibilities of the presidency and the impossibility of a man however great as a soldier with a lifetime of military education environment and experiences succeeding in civil office especially as great a one as the presidency of the united states | then came naturally a eulogium of horace greeley the maker of public opinion the moulder of national policies the most eloquent and resourceful leader of the republican party since its formation | the audience cheered with great enthusiasm all these allusions to general grant and responded with equal fervor to my praise of horace greeley | when i concluded they stood up and gave me cordial cheers and the presiding officer came forward and said: i now suggest that we close this meeting with three rousing cheers for horace greeley | the principal of the academy the manufacturer the minister the lawyer a very few of the audience and several women responded | after this frost a farmer rose gradually and as he began to let out link after link of his body which seemed about seven feet tall he reached his full height and then in a voice which could be heard a mile shouted: three cheers for general grant | the response nearly took the roof off the house | i left the state the next morning and told mr greeley that he could not carry maine | among the amusing episodes of the campaign was one which occurred at an open door mass meeting at watertown n y john a dix had been nominated for governor on the republican ticket and i was speaking of him and his career | he had changed from one party to the other five or six times in the course of his long career and each time received an office | there was great doubt as to his age because in the american encyclopaedia the date of his birth was given as of a certain year and in the french encyclopaedia which published his biography when he was minister to france a widely different date was given | in the full tide of partisan oratory i went over these changes of political activity and how each one had been rewarded also the doubt as to his age and then i shouted: i have discovered among the records of the pilgrim fathers that when they landed on plymouth rock they found john a dix standing on the rock and announcing that unless they made him justice of the peace he would join the indians | an indignant farmer who could not hold his wrath any longer shouted: that's a lie | the pilgrims landed more than two hundred and fifty years ago | i saw that my interrupter had swallowed my bait hook and line bob and sinker pole and all and shouted with great indignation: sir i have narrated that historical incident throughout the state from montauk point to niagara falls and you are the first man who has had the audacity to question it | another farmer stepped up to the heckler and said: here is my hat neighbor | you can keep it | i am going bareheaded for the rest of my life | in his uproarious laughter the crowd all joined | it was years before the questioning farmer could visit watertown without encountering innumerable questions as to when the pilgrims landed on plymouth rock | the last meeting of the campaign was held at mr greeley's home at chappaqua in westchester county | we all knew that the contest was hopeless and defeat sure | i was one of the speakers both as his neighbor and friend and accompanied him to new york | a rough crowd on the train jeered him as we rode along | we went to his office and there he spoke of the lies that had been told about him and which had been believed by the public of the cartoons which had misrepresented him especially those of tom nast and of which there were many lying about | leaning upon his desk a discouraged and hopeless man he said: i have given my life to the freeing of the slaves and yet they have been made to believe that i was a slave driver | it has been made to appear and people have been made to believe that i was wrong or faithless or on the other side of the reforms which i have advocated all my life | i will be beaten in the campaign and i am ruined for life | he was overcome with emotion and it was the saddest interview i ever had with any one | it was really the breaking of a great heart | he died before the votes were counted | there was instantly a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling in the country | he had lost his wife during the campaign and the people woke up suddenly to the sorrows under which he had labored to his genius as a journalist to his activity as a reformer and to a usefulness that had no parallel among his contemporaries | the president elect general grant and the vice president elect schuyler colfax attended the funeral and without distinction of party his death was universally mourned | after the election in consultation on railroad affairs commodore vanderbilt said to me i was very glad you were defeated which was his way of saying that he did not want me either to leave the railroad or to have other duties which would impair my efficiency | with the tragic death of mr greeley the liberal republican movement ended | most of us who had followed him resumed at once our republican party relations and entered actively into its work in the next campaign | the revolt was forgiven except in very few instances and the greeley men went back to their old positions in their various localities and became prominent in the official life of the state | i as usual in the fall took my vacation on the platform for the party |vii  rutherford b hayes and william m evarts it is one of the tragedies of history that in the procession of events the accumulation of incidents year by year and generation by generation famous men of any period so rapidly disappear | at the close of the civil war there were at least a score of generals in the north and as many in the south whose names were household words | about fifty five years have passed since the war closed and the average citizen knows only two of them grant and lee | one of the last acts of general grant was to tender to senator conkling the position of chief justice of the supreme court of the united states | conkling had gained from the senatorship and the leadership of his party a great reputation to which subsequent service in the senate could add little or nothing | he was in his early forties in the prime of his powers and he would have had before him as chief justice of this great court a long life of usefulness and distinction | conkling was essentially an advocate and as an advocate not possessing the judicial temperament | while there was a great surprise that he declined this wonderful opportunity we can see now that the environment and restrictions of the position would have made it impossible for this fiery and ambitious spirit | it was well known that general grant so far as he could influence the actions of the national republican convention was in favor of senator conkling as his successor | the senator's friends believed and they made him believe that the presidency was within his grasp | when the national convention met it was discovered that the bitterness between the two leaders blaine and conkling made harmony impossible | the bitterness by that time was on conkling's side against blaine | with the latter's make up resentment could not last very long | it is an interesting speculation what might have happened if these two leaders had become friends | it is among the possibilities that both might have achieved the great object of their ambitions and been presidents of the united states | the outstanding feature of that convention in the history of those interesting gatherings was the speech of colonel robert g ingersoll nominating mr blaine | in its effect upon the audience in its reception by the country and by itself as an effort of that kind it stands unprecedented and unequalled | as usual in popular conventions where the antagonism of the leaders and the bitterness of their partisanship threatens the unity of the party the result was the nomination of a dark horse and the convention closed its labors by presenting to the country general rutherford b hayes | president hayes although one of the most amiable genial and companionable of our presidents with every quality to attach men to him and make warm friendships was nevertheless one of the most isolated | he inherited all the business troubles economic disorganization and currency disturbances which grew out of the panic of 1873 | he was met with more bankruptcy than had ever occurred in our business history | with rare courage and the most perfect good nature he installed essential reforms which in the then condition of party organization and public sentiment practically offended everybody | he threw the extreme radicals of his party into a frenzy of rage by wiping out the carpet bag governments and restoring self government for the south | he inaugurated civil service reform but in doing so antagonized most of the senators and members of the house | when he found that the collector of the port of new york chester a arthur and the surveyor alonzo b cornell were running their offices with their vast patronage on strictly machine lines and that this had the general approval of party leaders he removed them and appointed for their successors general edwin a merritt and silas w burt with instructions to remove no one on account of politics and to appoint no one except for demonstrated efficiency for the place | he pursued the same policy in the internal revenue and post office departments | this policy threatened the primacy of the conkling machine | president hayes had a very strong cabinet | the secretary of state william m evarts and the secretary of the treasury john sherman were two of the ablest men in the country | evarts was the leader of the national bar and in crystallized mentality had no equal in the profession or outside of it | sherman was the foremost and best informed economist and also a great statesman | in close consultation with sherman hayes brought about the resumption of specie payment | the green backers who were for unlimited paper and the silver men who were for unlimited coinage of silver and who were very numerous joined the insurgent brigade | while mr hayes retired from the presidency by what might be called unanimous consent he had created conditions which made possible the success of his party in 1880 | it was a refreshing experience to meet the president during these troublous times | while everybody else was excited he was perfectly calm | while most of the great men at the capitol were raging he at the other end of the avenue was placid and serene | he said once to me: it is a novel experience when you do what you think right and best for the country to have it so generally criticised and disapproved | but the compensation is that you expect antagonism and disapproval and would think something was the matter with your decisions if you did not receive them | the general abuse to which he was subjected from so many sources affected the public's view of him | after he had left the presidency he told me that he thought it was the duty of an ex president to utilize the prestige which belonged to the office in the aid of education |  i have found he said that it helps enormously in colleges and schools to have lectures lessons etc in history and patriotism and behind them the personality of an ex president of the united states | as an illustration of how distinguished men when out of power no longer interest our people i remember i met mr hayes one day in front of a fruit display of a well known grocery establishment and after greeting said to the groceryman: that is ex president hayes | don't you want to meet him | the groceryman replied: i am not interested in him but i have the finest collection of pears in the city and want to sell you some | the capitol was full of the rich and racy characterizations epigrams and sarcasms which senator conkling was daily pouring out upon president hayes and especially secretary evarts | by all the rules of senatorial courtesy in those machine days a member of the cabinet from new york should have been a friend of its united states senator | mr evarts was too big a man to be counted in any other class or category except his own | of course all these criticisms were carried to both the president and the secretary of state | the president never mentioned them and i never heard evarts though i met him frequently make any reply but once | dining with mr evarts who entertained charmingly a very distinguished english jurist among the guests here on a special mission said: mr secretary i was at the senate to day and heard senator conkling speaking | his magnificent personal appearance added to his fine oratory must make him one of the most formidable advocates at your bar and in your courts | the english judge thought of course that mr evarts as the leader of the american bar and always in the courts would know every lawyer of distinction | mr evarts dryly replied: i never saw mr conkling in court | it is always dangerous to comment or narrate a racy story which involves the personal affliction of anybody | dining with mr evarts one night was also a very distinguished general of our civil war who had been an important figure in national politics | he was very curious to know about mr tilden and especially as to the truth of a report that mr tilden had a stroke of paralysis and appealed to me as i was just from new york | i narrated a story which was current at the time that mr tilden had denied the report by saying to a friend: they say i cannot lift my left hand to my head | he then put his right hand under the left elbow and shot the left one easily up to his face and said: see there my left has reached its goal | i saw that mr evarts was embarrassed at the anecdote and discovered afterwards that the distinguished guest had recently had a similar stroke on his left side and could propel his left arm and hand only with the assistance of his right | my old bogie of being put into office arose again in the senatorial election of 1882 | the legislature for the first time in a generation was entirely leaderless | the old organization had disappeared and a new one had not yet crystallized | mr evarts was anxious to be senator and i pledged him my support | evarts was totally devoid of the arts of popular appeal | he was the greatest of lawyers and the most delightful of men but he could not canvass for votes | besides he was entirely independent in his ideas of any organization dictation or control and resented both | he did not believe that a public man should go into public office under any obligations and resented such suggestions | a large body of representative men thought it would be a good thing for the country if new york could have this most accomplished capable and brilliant man in the united states senate | they urged him strongly upon the legislature none of whose members knew him personally and mr evarts would not go to albany | the members selected a committee to come down to new york and see mr evarts | they went with the idea of ascertaining how far he would remember with gratitude those who elected him | their visit was a miserable failure | they came in hot indignation to my office and said they did not propose to send such a cold and unsympathetic man as their representative to washington and earnestly requested my consent to their nominating me at the caucus the next morning | the committee telephoned to albany and received the assent of every faction of their party to this proposition | then they proposed that when the caucus met mr evarts of course should receive complimentary speeches from his friends | meanwhile others would be nominated and then a veteran member whom they designated should propose me in the interest of harmony and the union of the party whereat the sponsors of the other candidate would withdraw their man and i be nominated by acclamation | my answer was a most earnest appeal for mr evarts | then mr evarts's friends rallied to his support and he was elected | i place mr evarts in the foremost rank as a lawyer a wit and a diplomat | he tried successfully the most famous cases of his time and repeatedly demonstrated his remarkable genius | as a general railway counsel and therefore as an administrator in the retaining of distinguished counsels i met with many of the best men at the bar but never any with such a complete and clarified intellect as william m evarts | the mysteries of the most complicated cases seemed simple the legal difficulties plain and the solution comprehensible to everybody under his analysis | mr evarts was the wittiest man i ever met | it is difficult to rehabilitate in the sayings of a wit the complete flavor of the utterance | it is easier with a man of humor | evarts was very proud of his efforts as a farmer on his large estate in vermont | among his prizes was a drove of pigs | he sent to chief justice morrison r waite a copy of his eulogy on chief justice salmon p chase waite's predecessor and at the same time a ham saying in his letter: my dear chief justice i send you to day one of my prize hams and also my eulogy on chief justice chase both the products of my pen | the good things mr evarts said would be talked of long after a dinner | i remember on one occasion his famous partner mr choate who was a harvard man while evarts was a graduate from yale introduced mr evarts by saying that he was surprised that a yale man with all the prejudices of that institution against the superior advantages of harvard should have risked the coats of his stomach at a harvard dinner | mr evarts replied: when i go to a harvard dinner i always leave the coats of my stomach at home | mr evarts once told me when i was visiting him at his country place that an old man whom he pointed out and who was sawing wood was the most sensible philosopher in the neighborhood | mr evarts said: he is always talking to himself and i asked him why | his answer was: i always talk to myself in preference to talking to anybody else because i like to talk to a sensible man and to hear a man of sense talk |viii  general garfield the triumph of the democrats in maine in the september election 1880 had a most depressing effect upon the republicans and an equally exhilarating one upon the democrats | the paralyzing effect of the simple utterances in popular elections almost makes one think that every candidate should follow matthew quay's famous advice to his candidate for governor: beaver keep your mouth shut | in the campaign when general winfield scott ran for the presidency he began an important communication by stating that he would answer as soon as he had taken a hasty plate of soup | that hasty plate of soup appeared in cartoons was pictured on walls etc in every form of ridicule and was one of the chief elements of his defeat | when towards the close of the canvass garfield had succeeded in making the tariff the leading issue general hancock was asked what were his views on the tariff |  you must remember that the general was a soldier and had never been in politics | the general answered: the tariff was a purely local issue in pennsylvania | the whole country burst into a gale of laughter and hancock's campaign had a crack which was never mended | there never were two more picturesque opponents than general garfield and general hancock | hancock was the idol of the army of the potomac and everybody remembered mcclellan's despatch after one of the bloodiest battles of the peninsula campaign: hancock was superb to day | he was an exceedingly handsome man and one of the finest figures in uniform in the whole country | general garfield also presented a very fine appearance | he was a large man well proportioned and with very engaging manners | he also had an unusual faculty for attractive public addresses not only on politics but many subjects especially education and patriotism | i never can forget when the news of lincoln's assassination reached new york | the angry and dangerous crowd which surged up and down broadway and through wall street threatened to wreck the banking and business houses which were supposed to be sympathetic with the confederates | garfield suddenly appeared on the balcony of the custom house in wall street and succeeded in stilling the crowd | with a voice that reached up to trinity church he urged calmness in thought and action deprecated any violence and then in an impassioned appeal to hopefulness notwithstanding the tragedy exclaimed impulsively: god reigns and the republic still lives | i was requested by some friends to visit general garfield and see how he felt on the political situation which during the campaign of 1880 did not look hopeful | i took the next train spent the day with him and was back in new york the following day | when i left the train at cleveland in the morning the newsboys pushed at me a cleveland democratic daily with a rooster's picture covering the whole front page and the announcement that the democrats had carried maine | the belief was universal then that as maine goes so goes the union and whichever party carried that state in the september election the country would follow in the presidential contest in november | i took the next train to mentor the residence of general garfield | i found at the station a score or more of country wagons and carriages waiting for passengers | i said to the farmers: will any of you take me up to general garfield's residence | one of them answered: we will all take you up this morning but if you had come yesterday you would have had to wait your turn | it was a startling instance of the variableness of public opinion | delegations from everywhere on their way to extend greetings to the candidate had read the morning papers and turned back deciding not to go | i found garfield struggling bravely to overcome the depression which he felt | he was in close touch with the situation everywhere and discussed it with discrimination and hopefulness | the most affecting incident occurred while i was talking with him | his mother passed through the room and patting him on the back said: james the neighbors think it is all right they are raising a banner at the corner | two old soldier friends came in and the noonday dinner was a rare intellectual feast | the general was a brilliant conversationalist | his mind turned first to the accidents of careers | he asked me if there was not a time in my early struggles when if providence had offered a modest certainty i would not have exchanged the whole future for it and then continued: there was a period in my early struggles as a teacher when if i had been offered the principalship of an endowed academy with an adequate salary with the condition that i must devote myself to its interests and abandon everything else i am quite sure i would have accepted | of course the hopeful application of this incident to the maine defeat was that no such offer having been made or accepted he had made a glorious career in the army rising to the head of the general staff and for twenty years had been the leading figure in the house of representatives and was now a recently elected united states senator and chosen candidate for president | then he turned to the instances where victory had been plucked from defeat in battles | after citing many instances he gave a word picture of the battle of chickamauga which was the finest thing of the kind i have ever heard or ever read | after his two comrades left i told him of the interest which my friends were taking in his canvass and that i would add their contribution to the campaign committee | the general instantly was exultant and jubilant | he fairly shouted: have i not proved to you all day that there is always a silver lining to the cloud and that the darkest hour is just before dawn | it was one of the sources of general garfield's success as an orator that he was very emotional and sentimental | he happily carried with him amid all struggles and disappointments as well as successes in the making of a career the buoyant hopeful companionable and affectionate interests which characterize the ambitious senior who has just left college to take his plunge into the activities of life | so far as our state was concerned a great deal turned upon the attitude of senator conkling | his great and triumphant speech of four hours at the academy of music in new york brought all his friends into line but the greatest help which general garfield received was from the generous unselfish and enthusiastic support of general grant | general grant had been the leading candidate in the convention which finally nominated garfield but he voluntarily appeared upon the platform in several states and at garfield's home | his brief but most effective speeches gathered around garfield not only the whole of the old soldier vote but those who had become disaffected or indifferent because of the result of the national republican convention | there probably was no canvass where the republican orator ever had so many opportunities for the exercise of every faculty which he possessed | his candidate had made an excellent record as a soldier in the field and as a statesman in congress as an educator and a popular speaker on questions of vital interest while the opposition presented abundant opportunities for attack | after the presidential election came the meeting of the new york state legislature for the choosing of a united states senator | the legislature was overwhelmingly republican and the organization or machine republicans were in a large majority | the assembly was organized and the appointment of committees used to make certain the election of an organization man | a very unusual thing happened | the forces of the organization were divided between two candidates: thomas c platt and richard crowley | mr conkling had not declared his preference for either as they were both devoted friends of his though he had the power to have made a selection and have that selection accepted by the legislature | vice president elect chester a arthur appeared as manager for mr crowley | platt conducted his own canvass | i was called to a meeting in new york where mr blaine secretary of state was present | mr blaine said that administration managers had made a thorough canvass of the legislature and they had found that i was the only one who could control enough anti organization votes to be elected and therefore general garfield and his friends had decided that i must enter the race | i did not want to do it nor did i want the senatorship at that time | however it seemed a plain duty | a canvass showed that mr platt mr crowley and myself had about an equal number of votes | of course mr blaine's object was knowing that senator conkling would be hostile to the administration to prevent his having a colleague who would join with him and thus place the state of new york against the policies of the incoming president | after the canvass had been going on for some time mr platt came to me and asked why i was in it | i told him frankly that i was in it to see if possible that the senator elect should support the administration | he said: very well i will do that | i immediately called together my supporters | mr platt appeared before them and stated that if elected he would support the president and his administration in every respect | he was asked if he would vote for the confirmation of appointees whom the president might select who were specially in disfavor with senator conkling conspicuously senator william h robertson | mr platt said yes i will | my friends all went over to him and he was elected | general garfield was inaugurated in march 1881 and his difficulties began with his cabinet | senator conkling who saw clearly that with blaine in the cabinet his organization was in danger in new york did not want any of his friends to accept a cabinet position | the navy was offered to levi p morton but at the request of senator conkling he declined | when the time came for appointments in the custom house of new york general garfield sent in the name of william h robertson who was the leader of the anti machine forces in the state | mr conkling at once demanded that mr platt should join with him in inducing the senate to reject the nomination | under the rule of senatorial courtesy the senate would undoubtedly have done this if the two new york senators had acted together | mr platt told mr conkling of his pledge to the members of the legislature and that he must abide by it and as he told me suggested to mr conkling that as he always had been his friend and did not want any breach with him the only thing to be done consistent with honor was for both of them to resign and go back to the legislature for re election with a mandate which should enable them to reject the appointment of judge robertson and all similar appointments | as the legislature was overwhelmingly republican and the organization had a large majority it seemed to both senators that they would be returned immediately | but it is singular how intense partisanship will blind the ablest and shrewdest politicians | senators conkling and platt were among the ablest and most capable political managers of their time | what they did not reckon with was that the people of the state of new york or rather the republicans of the state having just elected a president would not view favorably the legislature of the state sending two senators to embarrass their own administration | there was hardly a newspaper in the state or in the country that did not take a hostile attitude | mr blaine again came to new york and insisted upon my entering the canvass and that i was the only one who could get the whole of the anti organization vote | with the democrats voting for their own candidate and the anti organization men voting for me it was impossible for any one to have a majority | the fight was most bitter | the ineffectual ballotting went on every day for months | then garfield was assassinated | the leader of the conkling forces came to me and said: you have a majority of the republican members now voting for you | of course the antagonism has become so great on your candidacy that we cannot vote for you but if you will withdraw we will go into caucus | i instantly accepted the proposition saw my own people and we selected warner miller to represent the administration and congressman lapham a very able and capable lieutenant of mr conkling to represent the organization | the caucus unanimously nominated them and they were elected | senator conkling immediately settled in new york to practise law and retired from political activities | it is the irony of fate that general garfield who did more than any other statesman to bring the public from its frenzy after the murder of lincoln back to a calm and judicious consideration of national conditions should himself be the victim so soon after his inauguration of an assassin | lincoln was assassinated in april after his second inauguration in march while garfield was shot in the railway station at washington july 2 following his inauguration | the president was removed to a cottage at long branch n j and lingered there with great suffering for over two months | i was living at long branch that summer and going up and down every day to my office in new york | the whole country was in alternate emotions of hope and despair as the daily bulletins announced the varying phases of the illustrious patient's condition | the people also were greatly impressed at his wonderful self control heroic patience endurance and amiability | it was the experience of a lifetime in the psychology of human nature to meet night after night the people who gathered at the hotel at long branch | most of them were office seekers | there were those who had great anticipations of garfield's recovery and others hidebound machinists and organization men who thought if garfield died and vice president arthur became president he would bring in the old order as it existed while he was one of its chief administrators | there were present very able and experienced newspaper men representing every great journal in the country | the evening sessions of these veteran observers of public men were most interesting | their critical analysis of the history and motives of the arriving visitors would have been if published the most valuable volume of who's who ever published | when president garfield died the whole country mourned |ix  chester a arthur chester a arthur immediately succeeded to the presidency | it had been my good fortune to know so well all the presidents commencing with mr lincoln and now the occupant of the white house was a lifelong friend | president arthur was a very handsome man in the prime of life of superior character and intelligence and with the perfect manners and courtesies of a trained man of the world | a veteran statesman who had known most of our presidents intimately and been in congress under many of them said in reviewing the list with me at the recent convention at chicago: arthur was the only gentleman i ever saw in the white house | of course he did not mean exactly that | he meant that arthur was the only one of our presidents who came from the refined social circles of the metropolis or from other capitals and was past master in all the arts and conventionalities of what is known as best society | he could have taken equal rank in that respect with the prince of wales who afterwards became king edward vii | the hail fellow well met who had been on familiar terms with him while he was the party leader in new york city found when they attempted the old familiarities that while their leader was still their friend he was president of the united states | arthur although one of the most rigid of organization and machine men in his days of local leadership elevated the party standards by the men whom he drew around himself | he invited into party service and personal intimacy a remarkable body of young exceedingly able and ambitious men | many of those became distinguished afterwards in public and professional life | the ablest of them all was a gentleman who i think is now universally recognized both at home and abroad as the most efficient and accomplished american diplomat and lawyer elihu root | there is no career so full of dramatic surprises as the political | president hayes put civil service reform upon its feet and without the assistance of necessary laws vigorously enforced its principles | among the victims of his enforcement was general arthur whom he relieved as collector of the port of new york | to the surprise of every one and the amazement of his old friends one of the first acts of president arthur was to demand the enactment of a civil service law which had originated with the civil service association and whose most prominent members were george william curtis and carl schurz | the president's urgency secured the passage of the measure | he then appointed a thoroughgoing civil service commission and during his term lived up to every requirement of the system | in doing this he alienated all his old friends and among them general grant ex senator conkling thomas c platt and also mr blaine whom he had asked to remain in the cabinet as secretary of state | among them was also john sherman whom he had equally wished to retain as secretary of the treasury | arthur's administration both in domestic affairs and in its foreign policies meets the approval of history and the impartial judgment of posterity | but he was not big enough nor strong enough to contend with the powerful men who were antagonized especially by his civil service reform tendencies | when the republican convention met in 1884 and nominated a new ticket it was universally recognized by everybody including the president that his political career had closed | president arthur was one of the most delightful of hosts and he made the white house the centre of refined hospitality and social charm | he was a shrewd analyst of human nature and told stories full of humor and dramatic effect of some of his contemporaries | general arthur while republican party leader in new york invited me to a dinner given him by a friend who had just returned from a hunting trip with a large collection of fine game | with the exception of myself all the guests were active leaders in the state machine | during the dinner the general said to me: while we draft you every fall to help in our canvass after we have nominated our ticket we miss you in our councils and we need you |  well i replied i do not know what the matter is nor why senator conkling should have a continuing hostility which i only feel when the time comes around to elect delegates to the state convention | the general continued: we are unable to find out either | however it is absurd and we are going to see that you are a delegate to the national convention and we want you to be at the state convention at utica | i went to albany knowing that there would be a conference at the executive mansion with general arthur governor cornell and senator conkling to lay out a programme for the convention | i met the then secretary of the state committee mr johnson and told him about my conversation with general arthur | he said he was going to attend the conference and would report to me | when mr johnson returned he told me that general arthur governor cornell and others had strongly urged my being a delegate and that senator conkling became very indignant and said that he did not want me back in the organization and that it was a matter of indifference on what side i was | it is needless to say that i did not attend the convention at utica | mr johnson also told me that among other things decided upon was that if general grant should be nominated for a third term the old machine under senator conkling would be made stronger than ever that the men who had come to the front during president hayes's administration as members of the state senate and assembly and of congress would be retired and that another state paper would be established which would wipe out the albany evening journal because it had sustained president hayes and his policies | while the convention was in session at utica i had an interview with mr george dawson who was editor of the albany evening journal and he became convinced that he had nothing to lose by entering at once into an open antagonism if there was any way by which it could be made effective | i said to mr dawson: the only salvation for those who have been benefited during the era of liberty occasioned by president hayes's civil service policies is to prevent the national convention adopting the unit rule | the unit rule is that if the majority of the delegates from any state make a decision the chairman of the delegation shall cast the entire vote of the delegation from the state for the result arrived at by the majority whether it be a candidate or a policy | under the unit rule i have seen a bare majority of one vote for a candidate and then the chairman of the delegation cast the entire vote for the candidate though the minority were very hostile to him | the delegates of the state convention at utica returned to albany that night | many of them were state senators whose decapitation was assured if the old machine supported by federal patronage was revived | state senator webster wagner was one of them | he and i chartered a train and invited the whole state delegation to go with us to chicago | in the preliminary discussions before the national convention met twenty six out of seventy eight delegates decided to act independently | wayne macveagh a lifelong friend of mine had a strong following in the pennsylvania delegation and after he learned our position brought over also his people | emory storrs who led the illinois delegation came to me and said that if we would not boom elihu b washburne who was a candidate for the nomination we would have the illinois vote | the result of the canvass was that the convention decided against the unit rule | this released so many individual delegates to independent action that the field was cleared and nobody had majority | the leading candidates were general grant james g blaine and john sherman | in the history of convention oratory the nominating speeches of senator conkling for general grant and james a garfield for john sherman take the highest rank | conkling took a lofty position on the platform | his speech was perfectly prepared delivered with great dramatic effect and received universal applause on the floor and in the gallery | general garfield on the other hand also a fine looking man and a practised orator avoided the dramatic element in which he could not compete with conkling but delivered a speech along the line of the average thought and general comprehension of his audience that made a great impression | it was a common remark: he has nominated himself | there were among the audience thousands of blaine enthusiasts | no public man since lincoln ever had such enthusiastic devoted and almost crazy followers as mr blaine | these enthusiasts were waiting to raise the roof and secure the nomination of their candidate when the chosen orator should present their favorite | the gentleman selected to present mr blaine was eminent in business and great enterprises but i doubt if he had ever spoken before except to a board of directors | of course in that vast hall such a man was fearfully handicapped and could not be very well heard | he closed by naming his candidate somewhat like this: i now have the pleasure and honor of proposing as the candidate of this convention that eminent statesman james s |blaine  nearly every one in the convention knew that mr blaine's middle name was gillespie | the blaine followers whose indignation had been growing throughout the speech because they expected the very highest type of oratory for their favorite shouted in chorus g you fool g | when general garfield was voted for he indignantly repudiated the votes as an imputation upon his honor as he was there to nominate his friend john sherman | senator george f hoar of massachusetts presided at the convention | he interrupted garfield by calling him to order as it was not in order to interrupt the calling of the roll and he did so for fear that garfield would go so far as to say he would not accept the nomination if it were made | on the last ballot state after state each striving to get ahead of the other changed its vote from sherman or blaine to garfield and he was nominated | i sat close to him as a visitor to the ohio delegation | it was a curious exhibit of the ambition of a lifetime suddenly and unexpectedly realized by a highly sensitive and highly wrought up man | he was so overcome that he practically had to be carried out of the convention by his friends | senator conkling was very indignant at the result and expressed his anger with his usual emphasis and picturesqueness | the ohio leaders were then anxious to placate new york but conkling would have nothing to do with them | they then came to us who had been opposed to the unit rule and wanted suggestions as to which new yorker they should select for vice president | levi p morton was suggested | mr morton said he would accept if senator conkling was willing to agree to it and that he would not act without the senator's acquiescence as he was an organization man | the senator refused his consent and told mr morton that no friend of his would go on the ticket | it was then suggested that they try general arthur who was conkling's first lieutenant and chairman of the republican state committee of new york | senator conkling made the same answer to general arthur but he frankly said to conkling: such an honor and opportunity comes to very few of the millions of americans and to that man but once | no man can refuse it and i will not | and so general arthur was nominated for vice president | x grover cleveland grover cleveland was a remarkable man | he had more political courage of the general jackson type than almost any man who ever held great responsible positions | he defied tammany hall while governor of the state and repeatedly challenged the strongest elements of his party while president | threats of defeat or retaliation never moved him | if he had once made up his mind and believed he was right no suggestions of expediency or of popularity had any influence on him | in personal intercourse he made friends and had great charm | the campaign against him when he ran for governor of new york was ruthlessly conducted | i considered the actions of his enemies as unfair and that they would react in the canvass | i studiously discredited all in my speeches and begged our people not to feature them | i knew mr cleveland and as an evidence of my appreciation of his character and ability when the office of general counsel of the new york central railroad at buffalo became vacant i offered it to him saying: i am exceedingly anxious that you should accept this place | i think by an adjustment of the administration of your office you can retain your private practice and this will add about fifteen thousand dollars a year to your income | mr cleveland replied: i have a very definite plan of life and have decided how much work i can do without impairing my health and how much of additional responsibility i can assume | i have accumulated about seventy five thousand dollars and my practice yields me an income which is sufficient for my wants and a prudent addition for my old age to my capital | no amount of money whatever would tempt me to add to or increase my present work | i doubt if there were many lawyers in the united states who had that philosophy or control of their ambitions | his annual income from his profession was considerably less than the compensation offered by the general counselship of the new york central | cleveland was most satisfactory as president in his quick and decisive judgment upon matters presented to him | there were no delays no revisions in fact no diplomatic methods of avoiding a disagreeable decision | he told you in the briefest time and in the clearest way what he would do | a great social leader and arbiter in social affairs in new york was very desirous that the president should reverse his judgment in regard to an appointment affecting a member of his family | i gave him a letter which procured him a personal and confidential interview | when he came back to me he said: that is the most extraordinary man i ever saw | after he had heard me through he said he understood the matter thoroughly and would not change his opinion or action | he has no social position and never had | i tried to present its attractions and my ability to help him in that regard but he only laughed yes he positively laughed | while president hayes had difficulty with civil service reform and incurred the hostility of the republican organization and machine men the situation with him was far less difficult than it was with cleveland who was a sincere civil service reformer and also an earnest democrat | while a democratic senator from ohio mr pendleton had passed a bill during the hayes administration for reform in the civil service the great majority of the democratic party believed in secretary marcy's declaration that to the victors belong the spoils | there was an aggravation also growing out of the fact that the democrats had been out of office for twenty four years | we can hardly visualize or conceive now of their hunger for office | the rule for rescuing people dying of starvation is to feed them in very small quantities and frequently | by trying this the president became one of the most unpopular of men who had ever held office in fact so unpopular among the democratic senators and members of the house that a story which zebulon vance of north carolina told went all over the country and still survives | vance who had a large proportion of the citizens of north carolina on his waiting list and could get none of them appointed said that the situation which ought to be one of rejoicing at the election of a president by his own party was like that of a client of his who had inherited a farm from his father | there were so many difficulties about the title and getting possession of it and delay that the son said: i almost wished father had not died | however mr cleveland in his deliberate way did accomplish the impossible | he largely regained favor with his party by satisfying their demands and at the same time so enlarged the scope of civil service requirements as to receive the commendation of the two great leaders of the civil service movement george william curtis and carl schurz | president cleveland entered upon his second term with greater popularity in the country than most of his predecessors | when he retired from office it was practically by unanimous consent | it is among the tragedies of public life that he lost entirely the confidence of his party and in a measure of the whole people by rendering to his country the greatest public service | a strike of the men on the railroads tied up transportation | railroads are the arteries of travel commerce and trade | to stop them is to prevent the transportation of provisions or of coal to starve and freeze cities and communities | cleveland used the whole power of the federal government to keep free the transportation on the railways and to punish as the enemies of the whole people those who were trying to stop them | it was a lesson which has been of incalculable value ever since in keeping open these great highways | he forced through the repeal of the silver purchasing law by every source and pressure and the unlimited use of patronage | his party were almost unanimous for the silver standard and resented this repeal as a crime but it saved the country from general bankruptcy | except in the use of patronage to help his silver legislation he offended his party by improving the civil service and retaining theodore roosevelt as head of the civil service commission | these crises required from the president an extraordinary degree of courage and steadfastness | while mr cleveland was in such unprecedented popular disfavor when he retired to private life his fame as president increases through the years and he is rapidly assuming foremost position in the estimation of the people | mr cleveland had a peculiar style in his speeches and public documents | it was criticised as labored and that of an essayist | i asked him after he had retired to private life how he had acquired it | he said his father was a clergyman and he had been educated by him largely at home | his father was very particular about his compositions and his english so that he acquired a ministerial style | the result of this was that whenever any of the members of the local bar died he was called upon to write the obituary resolutions | to take a leap over intervening years: after mr cleveland retired from his second term i used to meet him very frequently on social occasions and formal celebrations | he soon left the practice of law and settled in princeton where he did great and useful service until he died as trustee of the university and a lecturer before the students | riding in the same carriage with him in the great procession at the funeral of general sherman he reminisced most interestingly in regard to his experiences while president | every little while there would break out a cheer and then a shout in the crowd of one of the old campaign cries: grover grover four years more | mr cleveland remarked: i noticed while president a certain regularity and recrudescence of popular applause and it was the same in every place i visited | that cry grover grover four years more | would occur every third block and during our long ride the mathematical tradition was preserved |xi  benjamin harrison the year 1888 was one of singular experience for me | i was working very hard in my professional duties and paying no attention to public affairs | the district conventions to send delegates to the national convention at chicago began electing their delegates and alternates and passing resolutions instructing them to vote for me as their candidate for president | after several districts had thus acted i was asked to meet in whitelaw reid's office in the tribune building thomas c platt our state leader and united states senator frank hiscock | platt demanded to know why i was making this canvass without consulting the organization or informing them | i told him i was doing nothing whatever by letter telegram or interview that i had seen no one and no one had been to see me | mr platt who had been all his life accomplishing things through the organization was no believer in spontaneous uprisings and asked me frankly: are you a candidate | i told him i was not because i did not believe i could be nominated with the present condition of the public mind in regard to railways and i was president of one of the largest systems | then it was suggested that i permit the tribune which was the party organ to state that i was not a candidate and did not want to be | the next morning the tribune had that fully explained | the conventions kept on convening and instructing their delegates the same way | another conference was called and then i was asked to make the statement that if nominated i would not accept and if elected i would decline | i said to my conferees: gentlemen there is no american living big enough to say that | in the first place it is gross egotism to think such a thing might happen | the result was that the organization accepted the situation | plainly this seeker of trysts or any other thing promising adventure had more of resource than one might expect from a battered stranger lifted out of the gutter for the last rites | the priest who looked a good soldier and who was called padre vicente de los chichimecos of the wild tribes read further in his book of hours and then spoke the thing in his mind |  for a matter of many years in this land of the indies i have waited for a man of discreet determination for a certain work | the virgin herself led me to the gutter where you groaned in the dark and i here vow to build her a chapel if this thought of mine bears fruit | hump  my thanks to our lady and i myself will see to the building of the chapel | but tell me of the tree you would plant and we'll then have a guess at the fruit | it may prove sour to the taste | monkly messes appealed to me little on the other side of the seas | i've yet to test their flavor on this shore of adventure | padre vicente ignored the none too respectful comment and took from his pocket a bit of virgin gold strung on a thread of deer sinew |  your name is don ruy sandoval he said |  you are in this land for adventure | you content yourself with the latticed window and the strife of the streets why not look for the greater things | you have wealth and power at your call why not search for an empire of this | then he showed the virgin gold worn smooth by much wearing | don ruy blinked under the bandage and swore by bradamante of the adventure that he would search for it gladly if but the way was shown |  where do we find this golden mistress of yours | he demanded and why have you waited long for a comrade |  the gold is in the north where none dare openly seek treasure or even souls since coronado came back broken and disgraced | i have waited for the man of wealth who dared risk it and at whose going the viceroy could wink |  why wink at me rather than another |  that is a secret knotted in the fringes of the silken scarf there said padre vicente with a grim smile |  cannot a way be found to clear either a convent or a palace of a trouble breeder when the church itself lends a hand | you were plainly a breeder of trouble else had you escaped the present need of bandages | for the first time i see a way where church and the government of the indies can go with clasped hands to this work | in gold and converts the work may prove mighty | how mighty depends whether you come to the indies to kill time until the day you are recalled or improve that time by success where coronado failed |  and if we echo his failure |  none will be the wiser even then | you plan for a season of hunting in the hills | i plan for a mission visit by the sea of cortez | mine will be the task to see how and where our helpers join each other and all the provisioning of man and beast | mine also to make it clear to the viceroy that you repent your hollo |  don ruy interrupted with a grimace |  you are about to say i repent of folly or the enticing of a virgin or that i fell victim to the blandishments of some tricky dame i know all that cant by rote a man always repents until his broken head is mended but all that is apart from the real thing which is this: in what way does my moment with a lady in the dark affect the viceroy of the indies | why should his excellency trouble himself that ruy sandoval has a broken head and a silken scarf | padre vicente stared then smiled | ruy sandoval had not his wits smothered by the cotton wool of exalted pamperings |  i will be frank with you he said at last |  the viceroy i have not yet addressed on this matter | but such silken scarfs are few that one would not be a heavy task to trace to its owner |  ah i suspected your eminence had been a gallant in your time remarked don ruy amicably it is not easy to get out of the habit of noticing alluring things: that is why i refused to do penance for my birth by turning monk and shrouding myself in the gown | now come tell me | you seem a good fellow tell me of the 'do a bradamante' of the silks and the spices |  the destiny of that person is probably already decided stated the priest of the wild tribes she is if i mistake not too close to the charge of the viceroy himself for that destiny to be questioned | the mother it is said died insane and the time has come when the daughter also is watched with all care lest she harm herself or her attendants | so i hear the maid i do not know but the scarf i can trace | briefly the evident place for such a wanton spitfire is the convent | you can easily see the turmoil a woman like that can make as each ship brings adventurers and she seeks a lover out of every group |  jesus and hell to come | then i was only one of a sort all is fish to the net of the love lorn lady | maestro diego would have had the romance and the lily if he had walked ahead instead of behind me and he could have had the broken head as well | then he sniffed again at the bit of silk and regarded the monk quizzically |  you have a good story and you tell it well holy father he said at last and i am troubled in my mind to know how little of it may be truth and how much a godly lie | but the gold at least is true gold and whatever the trick of the lady may be you say it will serve to win for me the privilege to seek the mines without blare of trumpets | hum it is a great favor for an unknown adventurer |  unknown you may be to the people of the streets and to your ship mates agreed the padre |  but be sure the viceroy has more than a hint that you are not of the rabble | the broils you may draw to yourself may serve to disquiet him much yet he would scarce send you to the stocks or the service of the roads | be sure he would rather than all else bid you god speed on a hunting journey |  but that you are so given to frankness i should look also for a knife in the back to be included in his excellency's favors commented don ruy |  name of the devil what have i done since i entered the town but hold hands with one woman in the dark and be made to look as if i had been laid across a butcher block on a busy day | hell take such a city to itself | i've no fancy for halting over long in a pit where a gentleman's amusements are so little understood | if the do a of the scarf were aught but an amiable maniac the thing would be different | i would stay and i would find her and together we would weave a new romance for a new world poet | but as it is gather your cut throats and name the day and we'll go scouring the land for heathen souls and yellow clinkers | padre vicente de bernaldez was known by his wonderful mission work to be an ecclesiastic of most adventurous disposition | into wild lands and beyond the sea of cortez had he gone alone to the wild tribes so far had he gone that silence closed over his trail like a grave at times but out of the unknown had he come in safety | his fame had reached beyond his order and ruy sandoval knew that it was no common man who spoke to him of the indian gold |  francisco de coronado stated this padre of the wilderness came back empty handed from the north land of the civilized indians for the reason that he knew not where to search | the gold is there | this is witness | it came to me from a man who is dead | it was given him by a woman of a certain tribe of sun worshippers | to her it was merely some symbol of their pagan faith some priestly circle dedicated to the sun |  it sounds well agreed don ruy but the trail | who makes the way | and what force is needed | for a guide the padre vicente had a slave of that land a man of te hua baptized jos for five years the padre had studied the words and the plans | the man would gladly go to his own land he and his wife | all that was required was a general with wealth for the conquest | there were pagan souls to be saved and there was wealth for the more worldly minds | the padre asked only a tenth for godly reasons | thus between church and state was the expedition of his excellency don ruy sandoval ignored except as a hunting journey to the north coast of the cortez sea if he ranged farther afield his own be the peril for no troops of state were sent as companions | the good father had selected the men most of them he had confessed at odd times and knew their metal | all engaged as under special duty to the cross: it was to be akin to a holy pilgrimage and absolution for strange things was granted to the men who would bear arms and hold the quest as secret | most of them thought the patron was to be mother church and regarded it as a certain entrance to paradise | don ruy himself meekly accepted a role of the least significance: a mere seeker of pleasure adventures in the provinces | it would not be well that word of risk or danger be sent across seas and the viceroy could of course only say god speed you to a gentleman going for a ride with his servants and his major domo | and thus: between a hair brained adventurer and a most extolled priest began the third attempt to reach the people called by new spain the pueblos: the strangely learned barbarians who dwelt in walled towns cultivating field by irrigation and worshipping their gods of the sun or the moon or the stars through rituals strange as those of pagan egypt | word had reached mexico of the martyrdom of fray juan padilla at ci bo la but in the far valley of the rio grande del norte called by the tribes the river p o s o n g fray luis de escalona might be yet alive carrying on the work of salvation of souls | the young spanish adventurer listened with special interest as the devotion and sacrifices of fray luis were extolled in the recitals |  if he lives we will find that man he determined |  he was nobly born and of the province of my mother | i've heard the romance for which he cloaked himself in the gray robe | he should be a prince of the church instead of a wandering lay brother we will have a human thing to search for in the world beyond the desert ours will be a crusade to rescue him from the infidel lands | chapter viii the story by the desert well don diego marvelled much at the briskness of the plans for a season of hunting ere his troublesome charge was well able to see out of both eyes | but on being told that the range might be wide he laid in a goodly stock of quills and parchment for every league of the land would bring new things to his knowledge | these records were to be entitled relaciones of the new and wondrous land of the indian's island and in those relaciones the accounts of padre vicente were to loom large | among the pagan people his war against the false gods had been ruthless | maestro diego was destined to hear more of the padre's method than he dared hope in the earlier days | jos the indian of the north whose te hua name was khen zah went with them also his wife the only woman for without her the man would not go in willingness | two only were the members added by don ruy to the cavalcade one a stalwart fellow of many scars named juan gonzalvo who had known service with pizarro in the land of gold had lost all his coin in an unlucky game and challenged the young stranger from seville for the loan of a stake to gamble with and win back his losses | he looked good for three men in a fight | instead of helping him in a game don ruy invited him on the hunting trip | the other addition was as different as might be from the toughened gambling conquistador a mere lad who brought a letter from the hand of the viceroy as a testimonial that the lad was a good scribe if it so happened that his sanctity the padre or his excellency don ruy should need such an addition in the new lands where their hunting camps were to be | the boy was poor but for the learning given him by the priests his knowledge was of little save the knowledge of books | but his willingness to learn was great and he would prove of use as a clerk or page as might be | padre vicente was not present and the cavalcade was already two days on the trail but don ruy read the letter and looked the lad over |  your name is manuel lenares and called 'chico' because i am not yet so tall as i may be |  it should be manuella because you look not yet so manlike as you may be declared ruy sandoval and laughed as the angry color swept the face of the lad |  by our lady i've known many a dame of high degree would trade several of her virtues for such eyes and lips | tush boy | have no shame to possess them since they will wear out in their own time | i can think of no service you could be to me yet i have another gentleman of the court with me holding a like office name of the devil: it would be a fine jest to bestow upon him a helper for the ponderous 'relaciones' | and don ruy chuckled at the thought while the lad stood in sulky embarrassment willing to work but not to be laughed at | he was dressed as might be in the discarded garments of magnificence well worn and visibly made over to fit his young figure | his cloak of old scarlet too large for him covered a patched shirt and jacket and reached to his sandal straps of russet leather: scarce the garb of a page of the viceregal court yet above that of the native servant |  you are spanish | again the face of the youth flushed and he shrugged his shoulders and replaced his velvet cap with its pert cock's feather |  i have more than enough spanish blood to send me to the christian rack or stake if they caught me worshipping the pagan gods of my grandmother he stated briefly and plainly had so little hope of winning service that he was about to make his bow and depart in search of the padre | but the retort caught don ruy and he held the lad by the shoulder and laughed |  of all good things the saints could send you are the best he decided and by that swagger i'll be safe to swear your grandsire was of the conquistadores i thought so | well chico: you are engaged for the service of secretary to maestro diego maria francisco brancadori | you work is seven days in the week except when your protector marks a saint's day in red ink | on that day you will have only prayers to record on the other days you will assist at many duties concerning a wondrous account of the adventures don diego hopes for in the heathen land |  hopes for: your excellency |  hopes for so ardently that our comfort may rest in seeing that he meets with little of disappointment on the trail | for one instant the big black eyes of the lad flashed a shy appreciation of don ruy's sober words and merry smile |  for it is plain to be seen continued that gentleman that if don diego finds nothing to make record of your own wage will be a sad trial and expense |  i understand your excellency |  you will receive the perquisites of a secretary if you have indeed understanding continued don ruy but if there are no records to chronicle you will get but the pay of a page and no gifts to look for | does it please you |  it is more than a poor lad who owns not even a bedding blanket could have hoped for se or and i shall earn the wage of a secretary | that of a page i could earn without leaving the streets and comfort | oho  and again the eyes of don ruy wandered over the ill garbed figure and tried to fit it to the bit of swagger and confidence i guessed at your grandfather now i'll have a turn at you: is it a runaway whom i am venturing to enroll in this respectable company of sober citizens |  your excellency | the lad hung his head yet watched the excellency out of the corner of his eye and took heart at the smile he saw it is indeed true there are some people i did not call upon to say farewell ere offering my services to you but it is plain to see i carried away not any one's wealth in goods and chattals |  that is easily to be perceived said don ruy and this time he did not laugh for with all his light heart he was too true a gentleman to make sport of poverty such as may come to the best of men |  by our lady i've a feeling of kinship for you in that you are a runaway indeed this note mentions the teaching of the priests i'll warrant they meant to make a monk of you |  if such hopes are with them they must wait until i am born again decided the lad and again don ruy laughed: the lad was plainly no putty for the moulding and there was chance of sport ahead with such a helper to maestro diego | general harrison was by far the ablest and profoundest lawyer among our presidents | none of them equalled him as an orator | his state papers were of a very high order | when history sums up the men who have held the great place of president of the united states general harrison will be among the foremost | he retired from office like many of our presidents a comparatively poor man | after retirement he entered at once upon the practice of his profession of the law and almost immediately became recognized as one of the leaders of the american bar |xii  james g blaine i have spoken in every national canvass beginning with 1856 | it has been an interesting experience to be on the same platform as an associate speaker with nearly every man in the country who had a national reputation | most of them had but one speech which was very long elaborately prepared and so divided into sections each complete in itself that the orator was equipped for an address of any length from fifteen minutes to four hours by selection or consolidation of these sections | few of them would trust themselves to extemporaneous speaking | the most versatile and capable of those who could was james g blaine | he was always ready courted interruptions and was brilliantly effective | in a few sentences he had captured his audience and held them enthralled | no public man in our country except perhaps henry clay had such devoted following | mr blaine had another extraordinary gift which is said to belong only to kings he never forgot any one | years after an introduction he would recall where he had first met the stranger and remember his name | this compliment made that man blaine's devoted friend for life | i had an interesting experience of his readiness and versatility when he ran for president in 1884 | he asked me to introduce him at the different stations where he was to deliver long or short addresses | after several of these occasions he asked: what's the next station chauncey | i answered: peekskill |  well he said what is there about peekskill |  i was born there i answered |  well he said rising i always thought that you were born at poughkeepsie |  no peekskill | just then we were running into the station and as the train stopped i stepped forward to introduce him to the great crowd which had gathered there from a radius of fifty miles | he pushed me back in a very dramatic way and shouted: fellow citizens allow me to make the introduction here | as i have many times in the last quarter of a century travelled up and down your beautiful hudson river with its majestic scenery made famous by the genius of washington irving and upon the floating palaces not equalled anywhere else in the world or when the steamer has passed through this picturesque bay and opposite your village i have had emotions of tenderness and loving memories greater than those impressed by any other town because i have said to myself: 'there is the birthplace of one of my best friends chauncey depew ' | local committees who desire to use the candidate to help the party in their neighborhood and also their county tickets are invariably most unreasonable and merciless in their demands upon the time of the candidate | they know perfectly well that he has to speak many times a day that there is a limit to his strength and to his vocal cords and yet they will exact from him an effort which would prevent his filling other engagements if they possibly can | this was notoriously the case during mr blaine's trip through the state of new york and afterwards through the country | the strain upon him was unprecedented and very naturally he at times showed his irritation and some temper | the local committees would do their best with the railroad company and with blaine's managers in new york to prolong his stay and speech at each station | he would be scheduled according to the importance of the place for five ten fifteen twenty or thirty minutes | before we reached albany he asked me to accompany him to the end of our line at buffalo and make the introduction as usual at the stations | the committee would sometimes succeed in changing the programme and make the stays longer at their several places | mr blaine's arrangement with me was that after he had decided how long he would speak i should fill up the time whether it was longer or shorter | that would often enlarge my speech but i was young and vigorous and had no responsibilities | i remember one committee where the train was scheduled for ten minutes succeed in having it delayed an hour and instead of a brief address from the platform of the car carried the presidential party to a stand in the central square where many thousands had gathered | in the first place this city was not on mr blaine's schedule and as it was late in the afternoon after a fatiguing day he therefore told the committee peremptorily that ten minutes was his limit | then he said to me: chauncey you will have to fill out the hour | mr blaine's wonderful magnetism the impression he made upon every one and his tactful flattery of local pride did a great deal to remove the prejudices against him which were being fomented by a propaganda of a mugwump committee in new york | this propaganda as is usually the case assailed his personal integrity | notwithstanding the predictions made at the time he was nominated and it was subsequently repeated that he would not carry new york | from my own experience of many years with the people of the state and from the platform view point i felt confident that he would have a majority in the election | it was a few days before the close of the canvass when i was in the western part of the state i received an urgent telegram from mr blaine to join him on the train which was to leave the grand central station in new york early next morning for his tour of new england | upon arrival i was met by a messenger who took me at once to mr blaine's car which started a few minutes afterwards | there was an unusual excitement in the crowd which was speedily explained | the best account mr blaine gave me himself in saying: i felt decidedly that everything was well in new york | it was against my judgment to return here | our national committee however found that a large body of protestant clergymen wanted to meet me and extend their support | they thought this would offset the charges made by the 'mugwump' committee | i did not believe that any such recognition was necessary | however their demands for my return and to meet this body became so importunate that i yielded my own judgment |  i was engaged in my room with the committee and other visitors when i was summoned to the lobby of the hotel to meet the clergymen | i had prepared no speech in fact had not thought up a reply | when their spokesman reverend doctor burchard began to address me my only hope was that he would continue long enough for me to prepare an appropriate response | i had a very definite idea of what he would say and so paid little attention to his speech | in the evening the reporters began rushing in and wanted my opinion of doctor burchard's statement that the main issue of the campaign was 'rum romanism and rebellion '| if i had heard him utter these words i would have answered at once and that would have been effective but i am still in doubt as to what to say about it now | the situation is very difficult and almost anything i say is likely to bitterly offend one side or the other | now i want you to do all the introductions and be beside me to day as far as possible | i have become doubtful about everybody and you are always sure footed | i have treasured that compliment ever since | as we rode through the streets of new haven the democrats had placed men upon the tops of the houses on either side and they threw out in the air thousands of leaflets charging blaine with having assented to the issue which doctor burchard had put out rum romanism and rebellion | they so filled the air that it seemed a shower and littered the streets | a distinguished catholic prelate said to me: we had to resent an insult like that and i estimate that the remark has changed fifty thousand votes | i know personally of about five thousand which were changed in our state but still blaine lost new york and the presidency by a majority against him of only one thousand one hundred and forty nine votes | whenever i visited washington i always called upon mr blaine | the fascination of the statesman and his wonderful conversational power made every visit an event to be remembered | on one occasion he said to me: chauncey i am in very low spirits to day | i have read over the first volume of my 'twenty years in congress ' which is just going to the printer and destroyed it | i dictated the whole of it but i find that accuracy and elegance can only be had at the end of a pen | i shall rewrite the memoirs in ink | in these days composition by the typewriter or through the stenographer is so common | there will be many who differ with mr blaine |xiii  william mckinley in the canvass of 1896 the republican organization of the state of new york decided if possible to have the national convention nominate levi p morton for president | mr morton won popular favor as vice president and the canvass for him looked hopeful | but a new man of extraordinary force and ability came into this campaign and that man was mark hanna of ohio | mr hanna was one of the most successful of our business men | he had a rare genius for organization and possessed resourcefulness courage and audacity | he was most practical and at the same time had imagination and vision | while he had taken very little part in public affairs he had rather suddenly determined to make his devoted friend william mckinley president of the united states | in a little while every state in the union felt the force of mr hanna's efforts | he applied to politics the methods by which he had so successfully advanced his large manufacturing interests | mckinley clubs and mckinley local organizations sprang up everywhere under the magic of hanna's management | when the convention met it was plain that mckinley's nomination was assured | the new york delegation however decided to present morton's name and submit his candidacy to a vote | i was selected to make a nominating speech | if there is any hope an orator on such an occasion has inspiration | but if he knows he is beaten he cannot put into his effort the fire necessary to impress an audience | it is not possible to speak with force and effect unless you have faith in your cause | after mr mckinley was nominated i moved that the nomination be made unanimous | the convention called for speech and platform so insistently that their call had to be obeyed | the following is an account from a newspaper of that date of my impromptu speech | the story which is mentioned in the speech was told to me as i was ascending the platform by senator proctor of vermont |  i am in the happy position now of making a speech for the man who is going to be elected |  laughter and applause | it is a great thing for an amateur when his first nomination has failed to come in and second the man who has succeeded | new york is here with no bitter feeling and with no disappointment | we recognize that the waves have submerged us but we have bobbed up serenely |  loud laughter | it was a cannon from new york that sounded first the news of mckinley's nomination | they said of governor morton's father that he was a new england clergyman who brought up a family of ten children on three hundred dollars a year and was notwithstanding gifted in prayer | laughter  it does not make any difference how poor he may be how out of work how ragged how next door to a tramp anybody may be in the united states to night he will be 'gifted in prayer' at the result of this convention |  cheers and laughter |  there is a principle dear to the american heart | it is the principle which moves american spindles starts the industries and makes the wage earners sought for instead of seeking employment | that principle is embodied in mckinley | his personality explains the nomination to day | and his personality will carry into the presidential chair the aspirations of the voters of america of the families of america of the homes of america protection to american industry and america for americans | cheers  as every national convention like every individual has its characteristics the peculiar distinction of the republican convention of 1896 was its adoption of the gold standard of value | an amazing and illuminating part of our political literature of that time is the claim which various statesmen and publicists make to the authorship of the gold plank in the platform | senator foraker who was chairman of the committee on resolutions devotes a considerable part of his interesting autobiography to the discussion of this question | he is very severe upon all those who claim to have originated the idea | i have been asked by several statesmen to enforce their claims to its authorship | the silver craze had not yet subsided | bimetallism had strong advocates and believers in our convention | i think even our candidate was not fully convinced at that time of the wisdom of the declaration | it went into the platform rather as a venture than an article of faith but to the surprise of both the journalists and campaign orators it turned out that the people had become converted to the gold standard and it proved to be the strongest and most popular declaration of the convention | when the campaign opened the genius of mark hanna soon became evident | he organized a campaign of education such as had never been dreamed of much less attempted | travelling publicity agents with wagonloads of pamphlets filled the highways and the byways and no home was so isolated that it did not receive its share | columns in the newspapers especially the country papers were filled with articles written by experts and the platform was never so rich with public speakers | such a campaign is irresistible | its influence is felt by everybody its arguments become automatically and almost insensibly the common language of the people | but the expense is so terrific that it will never again be attempted | there was no corruption or purchase of votes in mr hanna's management | it was publicity and again publicity but it cost nearly five millions of dollars | to reach the one hundred and ten million of people in the united states in such a way would involve a sum so vast that public opinion would never permit any approach to it | mr mckinley's front porch campaign was a picturesque and captivating feature | the candidate was a handsome man and an eloquent speaker with a cordial and sympathetic manner which won everybody | delegations from all parts of the country and representing every phase of american life appeared at mr mckinley's residence | his address to them was always appropriate and his reception made the visitors his fast friends | i received a personal request to visit him and on the occasion he said to me: in certain large agricultural sections there is a very dangerous revolt in our party owing to the bad conditions among the farmers | wheat and corn are selling below the cost of production | i wish you would go down among them and make speeches explaining the economic conditions which have produced this result and how we propose to and will remedy it |  mr mckinley i said my position as a railroad president i am afraid would antagonize them |  on the contrary your very position will draw the largest audiences and receive the greater attention | the result proved that he was correct | i recall one meeting in particular | there were thousands present all farmers | in the midst of my speech one man arose and said: chauncey depew we appreciate your coming here and we are very anxious to hear you | your speech is very charming and interesting but i want to put this to you personally | we here are suffering from market conditions for the products of our farms | the prices are so low that we have difficulty in meeting the interest on our mortgages and paying our taxes no matter how seriously we economize | now you are the president of one of the greatest railroads in the country | it is reported that you are receiving a salary of fifty thousand dollars a year | you are here in a private car | don't you think that the contrast between you and us makes it difficult for us poor farmers to give you the welcome which we would like | i saw at once i had lost my audience | i then ventured upon a statement of conditions which i have often tried and always successfully | i said: my friend what you say about me is true | now as to my career i was born and brought up in a village similar to the one which is near you here | my father gave me my education and nothing else with which to begin life | as a young lawyer i was looking for clients and not for office | i made up my mind that there were no opportunities offered in the village but that the chances of success were in the service of corporations | the result is that i have accomplished what you have described | now my friend i believe that you have a promising boy | i also believe that to your pride and satisfaction he is going through the neighboring college here and that you intend on account of his brightness and ability to make him a lawyer | when he is admitted to the bar do you expect him to try to do what i have accomplished and make an independent position in life or fail | the farmer shouted: chauncey you are all right | go ahead and keep it up | my arguments and presentation were no better than many another speaker's but as mr mckinley predicted they received an attention and aroused a discussion because of what the old farmer had said that no other campaigner could command | mr mckinley sent for me again and said: sentiment is a wonderful force in politics | mr bryan my opponent has made a remarkable speaking tour through our state | he started in the early morning from cleveland with a speech | his train made many stops on the way to cincinnati where he arrived in the evening and at each place he addressed large audiences traversing the state from one side to the other | his endurance and versatility have made a great impression upon our people | to meet and overcome that impression i have asked you to come here and repeat bryan's effort | you are so much older than he is i think we may claim nearly twice his age that if you can do it and i hope you can that sentiment will be dissipated | i traversed mr bryan's route stopped at the same stations and delivered speeches to similar audiences of about the same length | on arriving in cincinnati in the evening i was met by a committee the chairman of which said: we have followed you all along from cleveland where you started at seven o'clock this morning and it is fine | now mr bryan when he arrived here had no meeting | we have seven thousand people in the music hall and if you will go there and speak five minutes it will make your trip a phenomenal success | i went to the music hall of course had a wonderful time and wild ovation and spoke for an hour | the next day i was none the worse for this twelve hours' experience | president mckinley had spent most of his life in the house of representatives | he loved the associations and life of congress | the most erratic and uncertain of bodies is congress to an executive who does not understand its temper and characteristics | mckinley was past master of this | almost every president has been greatly relieved when congress adjourned but mr mckinley often expressed to me his wish that congress would always be in session as he never was so happy as when he could be in daily contact with it | his door was open at all times to a senator or a member of the house of representatives | if either failed to see him at least once a week the absentee usually received a message stating that the president desired him to call | he was very keen in discovering any irritation on the part of any senator or member about any disappointment or fancied slight and always most tactfully managed to straighten the matter out | he was quite as attentive and as particular with the opposition as with members of his own party | president mckinley had a wonderful way of dealing with office seekers and with their friends and supporters | a phrase of his became part of the common language of the capital | it was: my dear fellow i am most anxious to oblige you but i am so situated that i cannot give you what you want | i will however try to find you something equally as good | the anxious caller for favors if he or his congressman failed to get the office desired always carried away a flower or a bouquet given by the president with a complimentary remark to be remembered | it soon came to be understood among applicants for office that a desired consulship in england could not be granted but one of equal rank in south africa was possible | there were many good stories in the senate of his tact in dealing with the opposition | a southern senator who as a general had made a distinguished record in the civil war on the confederate side was very resentful and would frequently remark to his friends that our president unfortunately is not a gentleman and in his ancestry is some very common blood | mr mckinley persuaded some of the senator's southern colleagues to bring him to the white house | he expressed his regret to the senator that he should have offended him in any way and asked what he had done | the senator replied: you have appointed for the town where my sister lives a nigger and a bad nigger at that for postmaster and my sister has to go to him for her letters and stamps | the president arranged for the transfer of this postmaster and the appointment of a man recommended by the senator | the senator then went to his friends and said: have i remarked to you at any time that our president was not a gentleman and had somewhere in his ancestry very common blood | if i did i recall the statement and apologize | mr mckinley is a perfect gentleman | all the measures which the president wished passed unless they were absolutely partisan always received afterwards the support of the southern senator | i was in the senate during a part of his term and nearly every day at the white house where his reception was so cordial and his treatment of the matter presented so sympathetic that it was a delight to go there instead of being as usual one of the most disagreeable tasks imposed upon a senator | he had a way of inviting one to a private conference and with impressing you with its confidential character and the trust he reposed in your advice and judgment which was most flattering | entertainments at the white house were frequent and he managed to make each dinner an event to be most pleasantly remembered | i think while he was very courteous to everybody he was more than usually so to me because of an incident prior to his inauguration | a well known journalist came to my office one day and said: i am just from canton where i have been several days with the president | i discussed with him federal appointments among others the mission to england in which i am interested because my father is an englishman and both my father and i are exceedingly anxious to have you take the post and mr mckinley authorized me to ask you if you would accept the mission | the embassy to england presented peculiar attraction to me because i knew personally the prince of wales and most of the leading english statesmen and public men | the journalist said that if i accepted he would sound the press | this he did and the response was most flattering from journals of all political views | about the time of the inauguration vice president hobart who was a cordial friend of mine said to me: there is something wrong about you with the president | it is very serious and you can expect no recognition from the administration | i was wholly at a loss to account for the matter and would not investigate any further | not long afterwards the vice president came to me and said: i have found out the truth of that matter of yours and have explained it satisfactorily to the president who deeply regrets that he was misled by a false report from a friend in whom he had confidence | soon after the president made me the offer of the mission to germany | i did not understand the language and felt that i could be of little service there and so declined | when president mckinley was lying seriously wounded at buffalo from the shot of the anarchist czolgosz i went there to see if anything could be done for his comfort | for some time there was hope he would recover and that it would be better for him to go to washington | i made every arrangement to take him to the capital if the doctors decided it could be done | but suddenly as is always the case with wounds of that kind a crisis arrived in which he died | vice president roosevelt was camping in the adirondacks | a message reached him and the next morning he arrived in buffalo | the cabinet of mr mckinley decided that the vice president should be at once inaugurated as president | colonel roosevelt was a guest at the house of mr ainsley wilcox | he invited me to witness his inauguration which occurred the same evening | it was a small company gathered in the parlor of mr wilcox's house | elihu root secretary of state choking with emotion and in a voice full of tears made a speech which was a beautiful tribute to the dead president and a clear statement of the necessity of immediate action to avoid an interregnum in the government | john raymond hazel united states district judge administered the oath and the new president delivered a brief and affecting answer to mr root's address | this inauguration was in pathetic and simple contrast to that which had preceded at the capitol at washington | among the few present was senator mark hanna | he had been more instrumental than any one in the united states in the selection of mr mckinley for president and his triumphant election | mr mckinley put absolute trust in hanna and hanna was the most powerful personality in the country | no two men in public life were ever so admirably fitted for each other as president mckinley and senator hanna | the day before the death of the president hanna could look forward to four years of increasing power and usefulness with the president who had just been re elected | but as he walked with me from mr wilcox's house that night he felt keenly that he never could have any such relation with colonel roosevelt | he was personally exceedingly fond of mr mckinley and to his grief at the death of his friend was added a full apprehension of his changed position in american public life |xlv  theodore roosevelt the bullet of the assassin had ended fatally and mckinley was no more | theodore roosevelt vice president became president | few recognized at the time there had come into the presidency of the united states one of the most remarkable capable and original men who ever occupied the white house | during the following seven years president roosevelt not only occupied but filled the stage of public affairs in the united states | even now two years or more after his death with the exception of president wilson roosevelt is the best known american in the world | it is difficult to predict the future because of the idealization which sometimes though rarely occurs in regard to public men but colonel roosevelt is rapidly taking a position as third with washington and lincoln as the other two | my relations with colonel roosevelt were always most interesting | his father who was a cordial friend of mine was one of the foremost citizens of new york | in all civic duties and many philanthropies he occupied a first place | the public activities of the father had great influence in forming the character and directing the ambitions of his son | mr roosevelt entered public life very early and as with everything with him always in a dramatic way | one of the interesting characters of new york city was frederick gibbs who was an active politician and a district leader | gibbs afterwards became the national committeeman from new york on the republican national committee | when he died he left a collection of pictures which to the astonishment of everybody showed that he was a liberal and discriminating patron of art | gibbs had a district difficult to manage because commencing in the slums it ran up to fifth avenue | it was normally democratic but he managed to keep his party alive and often to win and so gained the reputation that he was in league with tammany | he came to me one day and said: our organization has lost the confidence of the 'highbrows '| they have not a great many votes but their names carry weight and their contributions are invaluable in campaigns | to regain their confidence we are thinking of nominating for member of the legislature young theodore roosevelt who has just returned from harvard | what do you think of it | of course i advocated it very warmly |  well he said we will have a dinner at delmonico's | it will be composed entirely of 'highbrows '| we wish you to make the principal speech introducing young roosevelt who of course will respond | i will not be at the dinner but i will be in the pantry | the dinner was a phenomenal success | about three hundred in dress suits white vests and white neckties were discussing the situation saying: where did these stories and slanders originate in regard to our district about its being an annex of tammany and with tammany affiliations | we are the district and we all know each other | young roosevelt when he rose to speak looked about eighteen years old though he was twenty three | his speech was carefully prepared and he read it from a manuscript | it was remarkable in the emphatic way in which he first stated the evils in the city state and national governments and how he would correct them if he ever had the opportunity | it is a curious realization of youthful aspirations that every one of those opportunities came to him and in each of them he made history and permanent fame | the term of office of frank black governor of the state of new york was about expiring | black was a man of great ability and courage | the people had voted nine millions of dollars to improve the erie canal | there were persistent rumors of fraud in the work | governor black ordered an investigation through an able committee which he appointed | the committee discovered that about a million dollars had been wasted or stolen | black at once took measures to recover the money if possible and to prosecute the guilty | the opposition took advantage of this to create the impression in the public mind of the corruption of the republican administration | the acute question was: should governor black be renominated | colonel roosevelt had just returned from cuba where he had won great reputation in command of the rough riders and he and his command were in camp on long island | senator platt the state leader was accustomed to consult me and his confidence in my judgment was the greater from the fact that he knew that i wanted nothing while most of the people who surrounded the leader were recipients of his favor and either the holders of offices or expecting some consideration | he asked me to come and see him at manhattan beach | as usual he entered at once upon the question in hand by saying: i am very much troubled about the governorship | frank black has made an excellent governor and did the right thing in ordering an investigation of the canal frauds but the result of the investigation has been that in discovering frauds the democrats have been able to create a popular impression that the whole state administration is guilty | the political situation is very critical in any way | benjamin odell the chairman of our state committee urges the nomination of colonel roosevelt | as you know roosevelt is no friend of mine and i don't think very well of the suggestion | now what do you think | i instantly replied: mr platt i always look at a public question from the view of the platform | i have been addressing audiences ever since i became a voter and my judgment of public opinion and the views of the people are governed by how they take or will take and act upon the questions presented | now if you nominate governor black and i am addressing a large audience and i certainly will the heckler in the audience will arise and interrupt me saying: 'chauncey we agree with what you say about the grand old party and all that but how about the canal steal '| i have to explain that the amount stolen was only a million and that would be fatal | if colonel roosevelt is nominated i can say to the heckler with indignation and enthusiasm: 'i am mighty glad you asked that question | we have nominated for governor a man who has demonstrated in public office and on the battlefield that he is a fighter for the right and always victorious | if he is selected you know and we all know from his demonstrated characteristics courage and ability that every thief will be caught and punished and every dollar that can be found restored to the public treasury '| then i will follow the colonel leading his rough riders up san juan hill and ask the band to play the 'star spangled banner ' | platt said very impulsively: roosevelt will be nominated | when the state convention met to nominate a state ticket i was selected to present the name of colonel roosevelt as a candidate for governor | i have done that a great many times in conventions but have never had such a response | as i went on reciting the achievements of roosevelt his career his accomplishments and his great promise the convention went wild with enthusiasm | it was plain that no mistake had been made in selecting him as the candidate | during the campaign he made one of the most picturesque canvasses the state has ever experienced | he was accompanied in his travels by a large staff of orators but easily dominated the situation and carried the audience with him | he was greatly amused at a meeting where one of his rough riders who was in the company insisted upon making a speech | the rough rider said: my friends and fellow citizens my colonel was a great soldier | he will make a great governor | he always put us boys in battle where we would be killed if there was a chance and that is what he will do with you | roosevelt as governor was as always most original | new york was an organization state with mr platt as leader and with county leaders of unusual ability and strength | governors had been accustomed to rely upon the organization both for advice and support | roosevelt could not bear any kind of control | he sought advice in every direction and then made up his mind | this brought him often in conflict with local leaders and sometimes with the general organization | on one occasion the state chairman who was always accustomed to be in albany during the closing day of the legislature to prevent in the haste and confusion characteristic of legislation at this time the passage of bad or unpopular measures bade the governor good by at midnight as the legislature was to adjourn the following day with the understanding that lawmaking was practically over | a large real estate delegation arrived the next morning with the usual desire to relieve real estate from taxation by putting it somewhere else | they came with a proposition to place new burdens upon public utilities | it was too late to formulate and introduce a measure on a question so important but there was a bill which had been in the legislature most of the session and never received serious consideration | the governor sent an emergency message to the legislature which had remaining only one hour of life to pass that bill | next day the tremendous interest in public utilities was panic stricken because the bill was so crude that it amounted to confiscation | the governor when applied to said: yes i know that the bill is very crude and unfit to become a law but legislation on this subject is absolutely necessary | i will do this: i have thirty days before i must make up my mind to sign the bill or let it become a law without my signature | within that thirty days i will call the legislature together again | then you can prepare and submit to me a proper bill and if we can agree upon it i will present it to the legislature | if the legislature passes that measure i will sign it but if it does not i will let the present measure bad as it is become a law | the result of the threat was that a very good and timely act was presented in regard to the taxation of public utilities a measure which largely increased municipal and state revenues | i know of no governor in my time who would have had the originality and the audacity to accomplish what he desired by such drastic operation | roosevelt's administration was high minded and patriotic | but by his exercise of independent judgment and frequently by doing things without consulting the leaders state or local he became exceedingly unpopular with the organization | it was evident that it would be very difficult to renominate him | it was also evident that on account of his popularity with the people if he failed in the renomination the party would be beaten | so it was unanimously decided to put him on the national ticket as vice president | the governor resisted this with all his passionate energy | he liked the governorship | he thought there were many things which he could do in another term and he believed and so stated that the vice presidency was a tomb | he thought that nobody could be resurrected when once buried in that sarcophagus | the national republican convention of 1900 was a ratification meeting | president mckinley's administration had been exceedingly popular | the convention met practically to indorse mckinley's public acts and renominate him for another term | the only doubtful question was the vice presidency | there was a general accord of sentiment in favor of governor roosevelt which was only blocked by his persistent refusal | roosevelt and i were both delegates at large and that position gave him greater opportunity to emphasize his disinclination | a very intimate friend of his called upon me and begged that i would use all my influence to prevent the colonel's nomination | this friend said to me: the governor's situation officially and personally makes it impossible for him to go to washington | on the official side are his unfinished legislation and the new legislation greatly needed by the state which will add enormously to his reputation and pave the way for his future | he has very little means | as governor his salary is ample | the executive mansion is free with many contributory advantages and the schools of albany admirable for the education of his six children | while in washington the salary of vice president is wholly inadequate to support the dignity of the position and it is the end of a young man of a most promising career | i knew what the friend did not know and it was that mr roosevelt could not be governor again | i was so warmly attached to him and so anxious for his future that i felt it was my duty to force his nomination if possible | governor odell was chairman of the delegation for all convention purposes but in the distribution of honors i was made the presiding officer at its meetings | the delegation met to consider the vice presidency | several very eloquent speeches were made in favor of mr roosevelt but in an emphatic address he declined the nomination | he then received a unanimous vote but again declined | a delegate then arose and suggested that he reconsider his determination and several others joined most earnestly in this request | roosevelt was deeply affected but nevertheless firmly declined | i knew there was a member of the delegation who had canvassed it to secure the honor in case roosevelt became impossible and that the next motion would be the nomination of this aspirant | so i abruptly declared the meeting adjourned | i did this in the hope that during the night with the pressure brought to bear upon him the colonel would change his mind | in the morning mr roosevelt surrendered his convictions and agreed to accept the nomination | in every convention there is a large number of men prominent in their several delegations who wish to secure general attention and publicity | as there were no disputes as to either candidate or platform these gentlemen all became anxious to make speeches favoring the candidates mckinley and roosevelt | there were so many of these speeches which of course were largely repetitions that the convention became wearied and impatient | the last few were not heard at all on account of the confusion and impatience of the delegates | while one orator was droning away a delegation from a western state came over to me and said: we in the extreme west have never heard you speak and won't you oblige us by taking the platform | i answered: the audience will not stand another address | roosevelt who sat right in front of me then remarked: yes they will from you | these speeches have pretty nearly killed the ticket and if it keeps up the election is over and mckinley and i are dead | he then seized me and almost threw me on the platform | the novelty of the situation which was grasped by the delegates commanded attention | i recalled what mr lincoln had once said to me defending his frequent use of anecdotes and this is what he said: plain people take them as you find them are more easily influenced through the medium of a broad and humorous illustration than in any other way | i had heard a new story a rare thing and began with the narration of it | alongside the chairman sat senator thurston | he was a fine speaker very ornate and highly rhetorical | he never indulged in humor or unbent his dignity and formality | i heard him say in a sepulchral voice to the chairman: great god sir the dignity and solemnity of this most important and historical occasion is to be ruined by a story | happily the story was a success and gave the wearied audience two opportunities to hear my speech | their laughter was internal relief and it was giving the external relief of changing their positions for new and more restful ones | my friend john m thurston came to philadelphia with a most elaborate and excellent oration | sitting in the audience on three different occasions i heard it with as much pleasure the last time as i had the first | when mr roosevelt as vice president came to preside over the senate it was soon evident that he would not be a success | his talents were executive and administrative | the position of the presiding officer of the united states senate is at once easy and difficult | the senate desires impartiality equable temper and knowledge of parliamentary law from its presiding officer | but it will not submit to any attempt on the part of the presiding officer to direct or advise it and will instantly resent any arbitrary ruling | of course mr roosevelt presided only at a few meetings before the final adjournment | when congress met again he was president of the united states | senators and members soon found that there was a change at the white house | no two men were ever so radically different in every respect as mckinley and roosevelt | roosevelt loved to see the people in a mass and rarely cared for private or confidential interviews | he was most hospitable and constantly bringing visitors to luncheon when the morning meetings in the executive offices had closed and he had not had a full opportunity to hear or see them | senator hanna was accustomed to have a few of his colleagues of the senate dine with him frequently in order to consult on more effective action upon pending measures | president roosevelt who knew everything that was going on often burst into hanna's house after dinner and with the utmost frankness submitted the problems which had arisen at the white house and upon which he wished advice or if not advice support more frequently support | any one who attended the morning conferences where he saw senators and members of the house and the public was quite sure to be entertained | i remember on one occasion i had been requested by several friends of his men of influence and prominence in new york to ask for the appointment of minister to a foreign government for a journalist of some eminence | the most hopeful began to despond and general lamentations prevailed throughout klosterheim | suddenly however a dull sound arose within a quarter of a mile from the city gate as of some feeble attempt to blow a blast upon a trumpet | in five minutes more a louder blast was sounded close to the gate | questions were joyfully put and as joyfully answered | the usual precautions were rapidly gone through and the officer of the watch being speedily satisfied as to the safety of the measure the gates were thrown open and the unfortunate travellers exhausted by fatigue hardships and suffering of every description were at length admitted into the bosom of a friendly town | the spectacle was hideous which the long cavalcade exhibited as it wound up the steep streets which led to the market place | wagons fractured and splintered in every direction upon which were stretched numbers of gallant soldiers with wounds hastily dressed from which the blood had poured in streams upon their gay habiliments horses whose limbs had been mangled by the sabre and coaches or caleches loaded with burthens of dead and dying these were amongst the objects which occupied the van in the line of march as the travellers defiled through klosterheim | the vast variety of faces dresses implements of war or ensigns of rank thrown together in the confusion of night and retreat illuminated at intervals by bright streams of light from torches or candles in the streets or at the windows of the houses composed a picture which resembled the chaos of a dream rather than any ordinary spectacle of human life | in the market place the whole party were gradually assembled and there it was intended that they should receive the billets for their several quarters | but such was the pressure of friends and relatives gathering from all directions to salute and welcome the objects of their affectionate anxiety or to inquire after their fate so tumultuous was the conflict of grief and joy and not seldom in the very same group that for a long time no authority could control the violence of public feeling or enforce the arrangements which had been adopted for the night | nor was it even easy to learn where the questions were put by so many voices at once what had been the history of the night | it was at length however collected that they had been met and attacked with great fury by holkerstein or a party acting under one of his lieutenants | their own march had been so warily conducted after nightfall that this attack did not find them unprepared | a barrier of coaches and wagons had been speedily formed in such an arrangement as to cripple the enemy's movements and to neutralize great part of his superiority in the quality of his horses | the engagement however had been severe and the enemy's attack though many times baffled had been as often renewed until at length the young general maximilian seeing that the affair tended to no apparent termination that the bloodshed was great and that the horses were beginning to knock up under the fatigue of such severe service had brought up the very elite of his reserve placed himself at their head and making a dash expressly at their leader had the good fortune to cut him down | the desperateness of the charge added to the loss of their leader had intimidated the enemy who now began to draw off as from an enterprise which was likely to cost them more blood than a final success could have rewarded | unfortunately however maximilian disabled by a severe wound and entangled by his horse amongst the enemy had been carried off a prisoner | in the course of the battle all their torches had been extinguished and this circumstance as much as the roughness of the road the ruinous condition of their carriages and appointments and their own exhaustion had occasioned their long delay in reaching klosterheim after the battle was at an end | signals they had not ventured to make for they were naturally afraid of drawing upon their track any fresh party of marauders by so open a warning of their course as the sound of a trumpet | these explanations were rapidly dispersed through klosterheim party after party drew off to their quarters and at length the agitated city was once again restored to peace | the lady paulina had been amongst the first to retire | she was met by the lady abbess of a principal convent in klosterheim to whose care she had been recommended by the emperor | the landgrave also had furnished her with a guard of honor but all expressions of respect or even of kindness seemed thrown away upon her so wholly was she absorbed in grief for the capture of maximilian and in gloomy anticipations of his impending fate | chapter vii | the city of klosterheim was now abandoned to itself and strictly shut up within its own walls | all roaming beyond those limits was now indeed forbidden even more effectually by the sword of the enemy than by the edicts of the landgrave | war was manifestly gathering in its neighborhood | little towns and castles within a range of seventy miles on almost every side were now daily occupied by imperial or swedish troops | not a week passed without some news of fresh military accessions or of skirmishes between parties of hostile foragers | through the whole adjacent country spite of the severe weather bodies of armed men were weaving to and fro fast as a weaver's shuttle | the forest rang with alarums and sometimes under gleams of sunshine the leafless woods seemed on fire with the restless splendor of spear and sword morion and breast plate or the glittering equipments of the imperial cavalry | couriers or bohemian gypsies which latter were a class of people at this time employed by all sides as spies or messengers continually stole in with secret despatches to the landgrave or under the color of bringing public news and the reports of military movements to execute some private mission for rich employers in town sometimes making even this clandestine business but a cover to other purposes too nearly connected with treason or reputed treason to admit of any but oral communication | what were the ulterior views in this large accumulation of military force no man pretended to know | a great battle for various reasons was not expected | but changes were so sudden and the counsels of each day so often depended on the accidents of the morning that an entire campaign might easily be brought on or the whole burthen of war for years to come might be transferred to this quarter of the land without causing any very great surprise | meantime enough was done already to give a full foretaste of war and its miseries to this sequestered nook so long unvisited by that hideous scourge | in the forest where the inhabitants were none excepting those who lived upon the borders and small establishments of the landgrave's servants at different points for executing the duties of the forest or the chase this change expressed itself chiefly by the tumultuous uproar of the wild deer upon whom a murderous war was kept up by parties detached daily from remote and opposite quarters to collect provisions for the half starving garrisons so recently and with so little previous preparation multiplied on the forest skirts | for though the country had been yet unexhausted by war too large a proportion of the tracts adjacent to the garrisons were in a wild sylvan condition to afford any continued supplies to so large and sudden an increase of the population more especially as under the rumors of this change every walled town in a compass of a hundred miles many of them capable of resisting a sudden coup de main and resolutely closing their gates upon either party had already possessed themselves by purchase of all the surplus supplies which the country yielded | in such a state of things the wild deer became an object of valuable consideration to all parties and a murderous war was made upon them from every side of the forest | from the city walls they were seen in sweeping droves flying before the swedish cavalry for a course of ten fifteen or even thirty miles until headed and compelled to turn by another party breaking suddenly from a covert where they had been waiting their approach | sometimes it would happen that this second party proved to be a body of imperialists who were carried by the ardor of the chase into the very centre of their enemies before either was aware of any hostile approach | then according to circumstances came sudden flight or tumultuary skirmish the woods rang with the hasty summons of the trumpet the deer reeled off aslant from the furious shock and benefiting for the moment by those fierce hostilities originally the cause of their persecution fled far away from the scene of strife and not unfrequently came thundering beneath the city walls and reporting to the spectators above by their agitation and affrighted eyes those tumultuous disturbances in some remoter part of the forest which had already reached them in an imperfect way by the interrupted and recurring echoes of the points of war charges or retreats sounded upon the trumpet | but whilst on the outside of her walls klosterheim beheld even this unpopulous region all alive with military license and outrage she suffered no violence from either party herself | this immunity she owed to her peculiar political situation | the emperor had motives for conciliating the city the swedes for conciliating the landgrave indeed they were supposed to have made a secret alliance with him for purposes known only to the contracting parties | and the difference between the two patrons was simply this: that the emperor was sincere and if not disinterested had an interest concurring with that of klosterheim in the paternal protection which he offered whereas the swedes in this as in all their arrangements regarding germany as a foreign country looked only to the final advantages of sweden or its german dependences and to the weight which such alliances would procure them in a general pacification | and hence in the war which both combined to make upon the forest the one party professed to commit spoil upon the landgrave as distinguished from the city whilst the swedish allies of that prince prosecuted their ravages in the landgrave's name as essential to the support of his cause | for the present however the swedes were the preponderant party in the neighborhood they had fortified the chateau of falkenberg and made it a very strong military post at the same time however sending in to klosterheim whatsoever was valuable amongst the furniture of that establishment with a care which of itself proclaimed the footing upon which they were anxious to stand with the landgrave | encouraged by the vicinity of his military friends that prince now began to take a harsher tone in klosterheim | the minor princes of germany at that day were all tyrants in virtue of their privileges and if in some rarer cases they exercised these privileges in a forbearing spirit their subjects were well aware that they were indebted for this extraordinary indulgence to the temper and gracious nature of the individual not to the firm protection of the laws | but the most reasonable and mildest of the german princes had been little taught at that day to brook opposition | and the landgrave was by nature and the gloominess of his constitutional temperament of all men the last to learn that lesson readily | he had already met with just sufficient opposition from the civic body and the university interest to excite his passion for revenge | ample indemnification he determined upon for his wounded pride and he believed that the time and circumstances were now matured for favoring his most vindictive schemes | the swedes were at hand and a slight struggle with the citizens would remove all obstacles to their admission into the garrison though for some private reasons he wished to abstain from this extremity if it should prove possible | maximilian also was absent and might never return | the rumor was even that he was killed and though the caution of adorni and the landgrave led them to a hesitating reliance upon what might be a political fabrication of the opposite party yet at all events he was detained from klosterheim by some pressing necessity and the period of his absence whether long or short the landgrave resolved to improve in such a way as should make his return unavailing | of maximilian the landgrave had no personal knowledge he had not so much as seen him | but by his spies and intelligencers he was well aware that he had been the chief combiner and animater of the imperial party against himself in the university and by his presence had given life and confidence to that party in the city which did not expressly acknowledge him as their head | he was aware of the favor which maximilian enjoyed with the emperor and knew in general from public report the brilliancy of those military services on which it had been built | that he was likely to prove a formidable opponent had he continued in klosterheim the landgrave knew too well and upon the advantage over him which he had now gained though otherwise it should prove only a temporary one he determined to found a permanent obstacle to the emperor's views | as a preliminary step he prepared to crush all opposition in klosterheim a purpose which was equally important to his vengeance and his policy | this system he opened with a series of tyrannical regulations some of which gave the more offence that they seemed wholly capricious and insulting | the students were confined to their college bounds except at stated intervals were subject to a military muster or calling over of names every evening were required to receive sentinels within the extensive courts of their own college and at length a small court of guard with numerous other occasional marks as opportunities offered of princely discountenance and anger | in the university at that time from local causes many young men of rank and family were collected | those even who had taken no previous part in the cause of the klosterheimers were now roused to a sense of personal indignity | and as soon as the light was departed a large body of them collected at the rooms of count st aldenheim whose rank promised a suitable countenance to their purpose whilst his youth seemed a pledge for the requisite activity | the count was a younger brother of the palsgrave of birkenfeld and maintained a sumptuous establishment in klosterheim | whilst the state of the forest had allowed of hunting hawking or other amusements no man had exhibited so fine a stud of horses | no man had so large a train of servants no man entertained his friends with such magnificent hospitalities | his generosity his splendor his fine person and the courtesy with which he relieved the humblest people from the oppression of his rank had given him a popularity amongst the students | his courage had been tried in battle: but after all it was doubted whether he were not of too luxurious a turn to undertake any cause which called for much exertion for the death of a rich abbess who had left the whole of an immense fortune to the count as her favorite nephew had given him another motive for cultivating peaceful pursuits to which few men were constitutionally better disposed | it was the time of day when the count was sure to be found at home with a joyous party of friends | magnificent chandeliers shed light upon a table furnished with every description of costly wines produced in europe | according to the custom of the times these were drunk in cups of silver or gold and an opportunity was thus gained which st aldenheim had not lost of making a magnificent display of luxury without ostentation | the ruby wine glittered in the jewelled goblet which the count had raised to his lips at the very moment when the students entered |  welcome friends said the count st aldenheim putting down his cup welcome always but never more than at this hour when wine and good fellowship teach us to know the value of our youth |  thanks count from all of us | but the fellowship we seek at present must be of another temper our errand is of business |  then friends it shall rest until to morrow | not for the papacy to which my good aunt would have raised a ladder for me of three steps abbot bishop cardinal would i renounce the tokay of to night for the business of to morrow | come gentlemen let us drink my aunt's health |  memory you would say count |  memory most learned friend you are right |ah  gentlemen she was a woman worthy to be had in remembrance: for she invented a capital plaster for gunshot wounds and a jollier old fellow over a bottle of tokay there is not at this day in suabia or in the swedish camp | and that reminds me to ask gentlemen have any of you heard that gustavus horn is expected at falkenberg | such news is astir and be sure of this that in such a case we have cracked crowns to look for | i know the man | and many a hard night's watching he has cost me for which if you please gentlemen we will drink his health |  but our business dear count shall wait please god until to morrow for this is the time when man and beast repose |  and truly count we are like as you take things to be numbered with the last | fie count st aldenheim | are you the man that would have us suffer those things tamely which the landgrave has begun |  and what now hath his serenity been doing | doth he meditate to abolish burgundy | if so my faith | but we are as you observe little above the brutes | or peradventure will he forbid laughing his highness being little that way given himself |  count st aldenheim | it pleases you to jest | but we are assured that you know as well as we and relish no better the insults which the landgrave is heaping upon us all | for example the sentinel at your own door doubtless you marked him | how liked you him methought he looked cold and blue | so i sent him a goblet of johannisberg |  you did | and the little court of guard you have seen that | and colonel von aremberg how think you of him |  why surely now he's a handsome man: pity he wears so fiery a scarf | shall we drink his health gentlemen |  health to the great fiend first |  as you please gentlemen: it is for you to regulate the precedency | but at least here's to my aunt the jolly old sinner that fasted each day from breakfast to dinner | saw any man yet such an orthodox fellow in the morning when sober in the evening when mellow | saw any man yet etc |  count farewell | interrupted the leader of the party and all turned round indignantly to leave the room |  farewell gentlemen as you positively will not drink my aunt's health though after all she was a worthy fellow and her plaster for gunshot wounds but with that word the door closed upon the count's farewell words | suddenly taking up a hat which lay upon the ground he exclaimed ah |behold  one of my friends has left his hat | truly he may chance to want it on a frosty night | and so saying he hastily rushed after the party whom he found already on the steps of the portico | seizing the hand of the leader he whispered friend | do you know me so little as to apprehend my jesting in a serious sense | know that two of those whom you saw on my right hand are spies of the landgrave | their visit to me i question not was purposely made to catch some such discoveries as you my friends would too surely have thrown in their way but for my determined rattling | at this time i must not stay | come again after midnight farewell | and then in a voice to reach his guests within he shouted gentlemen my aunt the abbot of ingelheim abbess i would say held that her spurs were for her heels and her beaver for her head | whereupon baron i return you your hat | meantime the two insidious intelligencers of the landgrave returned to the palace with discoveries not so ample as they were on the point of surprising but sufficient to earn thanks for themselves and to guide the counsels of their master | chapter viii | that same night a full meeting of the most distinguished students was assembled at the mansion of count st aldenheim | much stormy discussion arose upon two points | first upon the particular means by which they were to pursue an end upon which all were unanimous | upon that however they were able for the present to arrive at a preliminary arrangement with sufficient harmony | this was to repair in a body with count st aldenheim at their head to the castle and there to demand an audience of the landgrave at which a strong remonstrance was to be laid before his highness and their determination avowed to repel the indignities thrust upon them with their united forces | on the second they were more at variance | it happened that many of the persons present and amongst them count st aldenheim were friends of maximilian | a few on the other hand there were who either from jealousy of his distinguished merit hated him or as good citizens of klosterheim and connected by old family ties with the interests of that town were disposed to charge maximilian with ambitious views of private aggrandizement at the expense of the city grounded upon the emperor's favor or upon a supposed marriage with some lady of the imperial house | for the story of paulina's and maximilian's mutual attachment had transpired through many of the travellers but with some circumstances of fiction | in defending maximilian upon those charges his friends had betrayed a natural warmth at the injustice offered to his character and the liveliness of the dispute on this point had nearly ended in a way fatal to their unanimity on the immediate question at issue | good sense however and indignation at the landgrave finally brought them round again to their first resolution and they separated with the unanimous intention of meeting at noon on the following day for the purpose of carrying it into effect | but their unanimity on this point was of little avail for at an early hour on the following morning every one of those who had been present at the meeting was arrested by a file of soldiers on a charge of conspiracy and marched off to one of the city prisons | the count st aldenheim was himself the sole exception and this was a distinction odious to his generous nature as it drew upon him a cloud of suspicion | he was sensible that he would be supposed to owe his privilege to some discovery or act of treachery more or less by which he had merited the favor of the landgrave | the fact was that in the indulgence shown to the count no motive had influenced the landgrave but a politic consideration of the great favor and influence which the count's brother the palsgrave at this moment enjoyed in the camp of his own swedish allies | on this principle of policy the landgrave contented himself with placing st aldenheim under a slight military confinement to his own house under the guard of a few sentinels posted in his hall | for him therefore under the powerful protection which he enjoyed elsewhere there was no great anxiety entertained | but for the rest many of whom had no friends or friends who did them the ill service of enemies being in fact regarded as enemies by the landgrave and his council serious fears were entertained by the whole city | their situation was evidently critical | the landgrave had them in his power | he was notoriously a man of gloomy and malignant passions had been educated as all european princes then were in the notions of a plenary and despotic right over the lives of his subjects in any case where they lifted their presumptuous thoughts to the height of controlling the sovereign and even in circumstances which to his own judgment might seem to confer much less discretionary power over the rights of prisoners he had been suspected of directing the course of law and of punishment into channels that would not brook the public knowledge | darker dealings were imputed to him in the popular opinion | gloomy suspicions were muttered at the fireside which no man dared openly to avow and in the present instance the conduct of the landgrave was every way fitted to fall in with the worst of the public fears | at one time he talked of bringing his prisoners to a trial at another he countermanded the preparations which he had made with that view | i made up my mind that we should have a share of the honors and they laughed at me | i organized the majority and put the old families out of business and we became and are the rulers of the state | among the most brilliant debaters of any legislative body were senators joseph w bailey of texas and john c spooner of wisconsin | they would have adorned and given distinction to any legislative body in the world | senator albert j beveridge of indiana and senator joseph b foraker of ohio were speakers of a very high type | the senate still has the statesmanship eloquence scholarship vision and culture of senator lodge of massachusetts | one of the wonders of the senate was senator w m crane of massachusetts | he never made a speech | i do not remember that he ever made a motion | yet he was the most influential member of that body | his wisdom tact sound judgment encyclopaedic knowledge of public affairs and of public men made him an authority | senator hanna who was a business man pure and simple and wholly unfamiliar with legislative ways developed into a speaker of remarkable force and influence | at the same time on the social side with his frequent entertainments he did more for the measures in which he was interested | they were mainly of course of a financial and economic character | one of the characters of the senate and one of the upheavals of the populist movement was senator jeff | davis of arkansas | davis was loudly vociferously and clamorously a friend of the people | precisely what he did to benefit the people was never very clear but if we must take his word for it he was the only friend the people had | among his efforts to help the people was to denounce big business of all kinds and anything which gave large employment or had great capital | i think that in his own mind the ideal state would have been made of small landowners and an occasional lawyer | he himself was a lawyer | one day he attacked me as i was sitting there listening to him in a most vicious way as the representative of big corporations especially railroads and one of the leading men in the worst city in the world new york and as the associate of bankers and capitalists | when he finished senator crane went over to his seat and told him that he had made a great mistake warned him that he had gone so far that i might be dangerous to him personally but in addition to that with my ridicule and humor i would make him the laughing stock of the senate and of the country | jeff greatly alarmed waddled over to my seat and said: senator depew i hope you did not take seriously what i said | i did not mean anything against you | i won't do it again but i thought that you would not care because it won't hurt you and it does help me out in arkansas | i replied: jeff old man if it helps you do it as often as you like | needless to say he did not repeat | i have always been deeply interested in the preservation of the forests and a warm advocate of forest preservers | i made a study of the situation of the appalachian mountains where the lumberman was doing his worst and millions of acres of fertile soil from the denuded hills were being swept by the floods into the ocean every year | i made a report from my committee for the purchase of this preserve affecting as it did eight states and supported it in a speech | senator eugene hale a senate leader of controlling influence had been generally opposed to this legislation | he became interested and when i had finished my speech came over to me and said: i never gave much attention to this subject | you have convinced me and this bill should be passed at once and i will make the motion | several senators from the states affected asked for delay in order that they might deliver speeches for local consumption | the psychological moment passed and that legislation could not be revived until ten years afterwards and then in a seriously modified form | i worked very hard for the american mercantile marine | a subsidy of four million dollars a year in mail contracts would have been sufficient in addition to the earnings of the ships to have given us lines to south and central america australia and asia | shakespeare's famous statement that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet has exceptions | in the psychology of the american mind the word subsidy is fatal to any measure | after the most careful investigation while i was in the senate i verified this statement that a mail subsidy of four millions a year would give to the united states a mercantile marine which would open new trade routes for our commerce | this contribution would enable the ship owners to meet the losses which made it impossible for them to compete with the ships of other countries some having subsidies and all under cheaper expenses of operation | it would not all be a contribution because part of it was a legitimate charge for carrying the mails | the word subsidy however could be relied upon to start a flood of fiery oratory charging that the people of the united states were to be taxed to pour money into the pockets of speculators in new york and financial crooks in wall street | we have now created a mercantile marine through the shipping board which is the wonder and amazement of the world | it has cost about five hundred millions | part of it is junk already and a part available is run at immense loss owing to discriminatory laws | recently a bill was presented to congress for something like sixty millions of dollars to make up the losses in the operations of our mercantile marine for the year | while a subsidy of four millions under private management would have been a success but was vetoed as a crime the sixty millions are hailed as a patriotic contribution to public necessity | a river and harbor bill of from thirty to fifty millions of dollars was eagerly anticipated and enthusiastically supported | it was known to be a give and take a swap and exchange where a few indispensable improvements had to carry a large number of dredgings of streams creeks and bayous which never could be made navigable | many millions a year were thrown away in these river and harbor bills but four millions a year to restore the american mercantile marine aroused a flood of indignant eloquence fierce protest and wild denunciation of capitalists who would build and own ships and it was always fatal to the mercantile marine | happily the war has among its benefits demonstrated to the interior and mountain states that a merchant marine is as necessary to the united states as its navy and that we cannot hope to expand and retain our trade unless we have the ships | i remember one year when the river and harbor bill came up for passage on the day before final adjournment | the hour had been fixed by both houses and therefore could not be extended by one house | the administration was afraid of the bill because of the many indefensible extravagances there were in it | at the same time it had so many political possibilities that the president was afraid to veto it | senator carter was always a loyal administration man and so he was put forward to talk the bill to death | he kept it up without yielding the floor for thirteen hours and until the hour of adjournment made action upon the measure impossible | i sat there all night long watching this remarkable effort | the usual obstructor soon uses up all his own material and then sends pages of irrelevant matter to the desk for the clerk to read or he reads himself from the pages of the record or from books but carter stuck to his text | he was a man of wit and humor | many items in the river and harbor bill furnished him with an opportunity of showing how creeks and trout streams were to be turned by the magic of the money of the treasury into navigable rivers and inaccessible ponds were to be dredged into harbors to float the navies of the world | the speech was very rich in anecdotes and delightful in its success by an adroit attack of tempting a supporter of the measure into aiding the filibuster by indignantly denying the charge which carter had made against him | by this method carter would get a rest by the folly of his opponent | the senate was full and the galleries were crowded during the whole night and when the gavel of the vice president announced that no further debate was admissible and the time for adjournment had arrived and began to make his farewell speech carter took his seat amidst the wreck of millions and the hopes of the exploiters and the treasury of the united states had been saved by an unexpected champion | the country does not appreciate the tremendous power of the committees as legislative business constantly increases with almost geometrical progression | the legislation of the country is handled almost entirely in committees | it requires a possible revolution to overcome the hostility of a committee even if the house and the country are otherwise minded | some men whose names do not appear at all in the congressional record and seldom in the newspapers have a certain talent for drudgery and detail which is very rare and when added to shrewdness and knowledge of human nature makes such a senator or representative a force to be reckoned with on committees | such a man is able to hold up almost anything | i found during my washington life the enormous importance of its social side | here are several hundred men in the two houses of congress far above the average in intelligence force of character and ability to accomplish things | otherwise they would not have been elected | they are very isolated and enjoy far beyond those who have the opportunity of club life social attentions | at dinner the real character of the guest comes out and he is most responsive to these attentions | mrs depew and i gave a great many dinners to our intense enjoyment and i might say education | by this method i learned to know in a way more intimate than otherwise would have been possible many of the most interesting characters i have ever met | something must be done and that speedily to bridge the widening chasm between the executive and the congress | our experience with president wilson has demonstrated this | as a self centred autocrat confident of himself and suspicious of others hostile to advice or discussion he became the absolute master of the congress while his party was in the majority | the congress instead of being a co ordinate branch was really in session only to accept adopt and put into laws the imperious will of the president | when however the majority changed there being no confidence between the executive and the legislative branch of the government the necessary procedure was almost paralyzed | the president was unyielding and the congress insisted upon the recognition of its constitutional rights | even if the president is as mckinley was in close and frequent touch with the senate and the house of representatives the relation is temporary and unequal and not what it ought to be automatic | happily we have started a budget system but the cabinet should have seats on the floor of the houses and authority to answer questions and participate in debates | unless our system was radically changed we could not adopt the english plan of selecting the members of the cabinet entirely from the senate and the house | but we could have an administration always in close touch with the congress if the cabinet members were in attendance when matters affecting their several departments were under discussion and action | i heard senator nelson w aldrich who was one of the shrewdest and ablest legislators of our generation say that if business methods were applied to the business of the government in a way in which he could do it there would be a saving of three hundred millions of dollars a year | we are since the great war facing appropriations of five or six billions of dollars a year | i think the saving of three hundred millions suggested by senator aldrich could be increased in proportion to the vast increase in appropriations | there has been much discussion about restricting unlimited debates in the senate and adopting a rigid closure rule | my own recollection is that during my twelve years unlimited discussion defeated no good measure but talked many bad ones to death | there is a curious feature in legislative discussion and that is the way in which senators who have accustomed themselves to speak every day on each question apparently increase their vocabulary as their ideas evaporate | two senators in my time who could be relied upon to talk smoothly as the placid waters of a running brook for an hour or more every day had the singular faculty of apparently saying much of importance while really developing no ideas | in order to understand them while the senate would become empty by its members going to their committee rooms i would be a patient listener | i finally gave that up because though endowed with reasonable intelligence and an intense desire for knowledge i never could grasp what they were driving at |xvi  ambassadors and ministers the united states has always been admirably represented at the court of st james | i consider it as a rare privilege and a delightful memory that i have known well these distinguished ambassadors and ministers who served during my time | i was not in england while charles francis adams was a minister but his work during the civil war created intense interest in america | it is admitted that he prevented great britain from taking such action as would have prolonged the war and endangered the purpose which mr lincoln was trying to accomplish namely the preservation of the union | his curt answer to lord john russell this means war changed the policy of the british government | james russell lowell met every requirement of the position but more than that his works had been read and admired in england before his appointment | literary england welcomed him with open arms and official england soon became impressed with his diplomatic ability | he was one of the finest after dinner speakers and that brought him in contact with the best of english public life | he told me an amusing instance | as soon as he was appointed everybody who expected to meet him sent to the book stores and purchased his works | among them of course was the biglow papers | one lady asked him if he had brought mrs biglow with him | the secretary of the embassy william j hoppin was a very accomplished gentleman | he had been president of the union league club and i knew him very well | i called one day at the embassy with an american living in europe to ask for a favor for this fellow countryman | the embassy was overwhelmed with americans asking favors so hoppin without looking at me or waiting for the request at once brought out his formula for sliding his visitors on an inclined plane into the street | he said: every american and there are thousands of them who comes to london visits the embassy | they all want to be invited to buckingham palace or to have cards to the house of lords or the house of commons | our privileges in that respect are very few so few that we can satisfy hardly anybody | why americans when there is so much to see in this old country from which our ancestry came and with whose literature we are so familiar should want to try to get into buckingham palace or the houses of parliament is incomprehensible | there is a very admirable cattle show at reading | i have a few tickets and will give them to you gentlemen gladly | you will find the show exceedingly interesting | i took the tickets but if there is anything of which i am not a qualified judge it is prize cattle | that night at a large dinner given by a well known english host my friend hoppin was present and at once greeted me with warm cordiality | of course he had no recollections of the morning meeting | our host as usual when a new american is present wanted to know if i had any fresh american stories and i told with some exaggeration and embroidery the story of the reading cattle show | dear old hoppin was considerably embarrassed at the chafing he received but took it in good part and thereafter the embassy was entirely at my service | mr edward j phelps was an extraordinary success | he was a great lawyer and the chief justice of the supreme court of the united states told me that there was no one who appeared before that court whose arguments were more satisfactory and convincing than those of mr phelps | he had the rare distinction of being a frequent guest at the benchers' dinners in london | one of the english judges told me that at a benchers' dinner the judges were discussing a novel point which had arisen in one of the cases recently before them | he said that in the discussion in which mr phelps was asked to participate the view which the united states minister presented was so forcible that the decision which had been practically agreed upon was changed to meet mr phelps's view | i was at several of mr phelps's dinners | they were remarkable gatherings of the best in almost every department of english life | at one of his dinners i had a delightful talk with browning the poet | browning told me that as a young man he was several times a guest at the famous breakfasts of the poet and banker samuel rogers | rogers he said was most arbitrary at these breakfasts with his guests and rebuked him severely for venturing beyond the limits within which he thought a young poet should be confined | mr browning said that nothing gratified him so much as the popularity of his works in the united states | he was especially pleased and also embarrassed by our browning societies of which there seemed to be a great many over here | they sent him papers which were read by members of the societies interpreting his poems | these american friends discovered meanings which had never occurred to him and were to him an entirely novel view of his own productions | he also mentioned that every one sent him presents and souvenirs all of them as appreciations and some as suggestions and help | among these were several cases of american wine | he appreciated the purpose of the gifts but the fluid did not appeal to him | he told me he was a guest at one time at the dinners given to the shah of persia | this monarch was a barbarian but the british foreign office had asked and extended to him every possible courtesy because of the struggle then going on as to whether great britain or france or russia should have the better part of persia | france and russia had entertained him with lavish military displays and other governmental functions which a democratic country like great britain could not duplicate | so the foreign office asked all who had great houses in london or in the country and were lavish entertainers to do everything they could for the shah | browning was present at a great dinner given for the shah at stafford house the home of the duke of sutherland and the finest palace in london | every guest was asked in order to impress the shah to come in all the decorations to which they were entitled | the result was that the peers came in their robes which they otherwise would not have thought of wearing on such an occasion and all others in the costumes of honor significant of their rank | browning said he had received a degree at oxford and that entitled him to a scarlet cloak | he was so outranked because the guests were placed according to rank that he sat at the foot of the table | the shah said to his host: who is that distinguished gentleman in the scarlet cloak at the other end of the table | the host answered: that is one of our greatest poets |  that is no place for a poet remarked the shah bring him up here and let him sit next to me | so at the royal command the poet took the seat of honor | the shah said to browning: i am mighty glad to have you near me for i am a poet myself | it was at this dinner that browning heard the shah say to the prince of wales who sat at the right of the shah: this is a wonderful palace | is it royal | the prince answered: no it belongs to one of our great noblemen the duke of sutherland |  well said the shah let me give you a point | when one of my noblemen or subjects gets rich enough to own a palace like this i cut off his head and take his fortune | a very beautiful english lady told me that she was at ferdinand rothschild's where the shah was being entertained | in order to minimize his acquisitive talents the wonderful treasures of mr rothschild's house had been hidden | the shah asked for an introduction to this lady and said to her: you are the most beautiful woman i have seen since i have been in england | i must take you home with me |  but she said your majesty i am married |  well he replied bring your husband along | when we get to teheran my capital i will take care of him | mr phelps's talent as a speaker was quite unknown to his countrymen before he went abroad | while he was a minister he made several notable addresses which aroused a great deal of interest and admiration in great britain | he was equally happy in formal orations and in the field of after dinner speeches | mrs phelps had such a phenomenal success socially that when her husband was recalled and they left england the ladies of both the great parties united and through lady rosebery the leader of the liberal and lady salisbury of the conservative women paid her a very unusual and complimentary tribute | during john hay's term as united states minister to great britain my visits to england were very delightful | hay was one of the most charming men in public life of his period | he had won great success in journalism as an author and in public service | at his house in london one would meet almost everybody worth while in english literary public and social life | in the hours of conversation with him when i was posting him on the latest developments in america his comments upon the leading characters of the time were most racy and witty | many of them would have embalmed a statesman if the epigram had been preserved like a fly in amber | he had officially a very difficult task during the spanish war | the sympathies of all european governments were with spain | this was especially true of the kaiser and the german government | it was mr hay's task to keep great britain neutral and prevent her joining the general alliance to help spain which some of the continental governments were fomenting | happily mr balfour the british foreign minister was cordially and openly our friend | he prevented this combination against the united states | during part of my term as a senator john hay was secretary of state | to visit his office and have a discussion on current affairs was an event to be remembered | he made a prediction which was the result of his own difficulties with the senate that on account of the two thirds majority necessary for the ratification of a treaty no important treaty sent to the senate by the president would ever again be ratified | happily this gloomy view has not turned out to be entirely correct | mr hay saved china in the settlement of the indemnities arising out of the boxer trouble from the greed of the great powers of europe | one of his greatest achievements was in proclaiming the open door for china and securing the acquiescence of the great powers | it was a bluff on his part because he never could have had the active support of the united states but he made his proposition with a confidence which carried the belief that he had no doubt on that subject | he was fortunately dealing with governments who did not understand the united states and do not now | with them when a foreign minister makes a serious statement of policy it is understood that he has behind him the whole military naval and financial support of his government | but with us it is a long road and a very rocky one before action so serious with consequences so great can receive the approval of the war making power in congress | i called on hay one morning just as cassini the russian ambassador was leaving | cassini was one of the shrewdest and ablest of diplomats in the russian service | it was said that for twelve years he had got the better of all the delegations at pekin and controlled that extraordinary ruler of china the dowager queen | cassini told me that from his intimate associations with her he had formed the opinion that she was quite equal to catherine of russia whom he regarded as the greatest woman sovereign who ever lived | hay said to me: i have just had a very long and very remarkable discussion with cassini | he is a revelation in the way of secret diplomacy | he brought to me the voluminous instructions to him of his government on our open door policy | after we had gone over them carefully he closed his portfolio and pushing it aside said: 'now mr secretary listen to cassini '| he immediately presented an exactly opposite policy from the one in the instructions and a policy entirely favorable to us and said: 'that is what my government will do ' | it was a great loss to russian diplomacy when he died so early | as senator i did all in my power to bring about the appointment of whitelaw reid as ambassador to great britain | he and i had been friends ever since his beginning in journalism in new york many years before | reid was then the owner and editor of the new york tribune and one of the most brilliant journalists in the country | he was also an excellent public speaker | his long and intimate contact with public affairs and intimacy with public men ideally fitted him for the appointment | he had already served with great credit as ambassador to france | the compensation of our representatives abroad always has been and still is entirely inadequate to enable them to maintain in comparison with the representatives of other governments the dignity of their own country | all the other great powers at the principal capitals maintain fine residences for their ambassadors which also is the embassy | our congress except within the last few years has always refused to make this provision | the salary which we pay is scarcely ever more than one third the amount paid by european governments in similar service | i worked hard while in the senate to improve this situation because of my intimate knowledge of the question | when i first began the effort i found there was very strong belief that the whole foreign service was an unnecessary expense | when mr roosevelt first became president and i had to see him frequently about diplomatic appointments i learned that this was his view | he said to me: this foreign business of the government now that the cable is perfected can be carried on between our state department and the chancellery of any government in the world | nevertheless i am in favor of keeping up the diplomatic service | all the old nations have various methods of rewarding distinguished public servants | the only one we have is the diplomatic service | so when i appoint a man ambassador or minister i believe that i am giving him a decoration and the reason i change ambassadors and ministers is that i want as many as possible to possess it | the longer mr roosevelt remained president and the closer he came to our foreign relations the more he appreciated the value of the personal contact and intimate knowledge on the spot of an american ambassador or minister | mr reid entertained more lavishly and hospitably than any ambassador in england ever had both at his london house and at his estate in the country | he appreciated the growing necessity to the peace of the world and the progress of civilization of closer union of english speaking peoples | at his beautiful and delightful entertainments americans came in contact with englishmen under conditions most favorable for the appreciation by each of the other | the charm of mr and mrs whitelaw reid's hospitality was so genuine so cordial and so universal that to be their guest was an event for americans visiting england | there is no capital in the world where hospitality counts for so much as in london and no country where the house party brings people together under such favorable conditions | both the city and the country homes of mr and mrs reid were universities of international good feeling | mr reid on the official side admirably represented his country and had the most intimate relations with the governing powers of great britain | i recall with the keenest pleasure how much my old friend joseph h choate did to make each one of my visits to london during his term full of the most charming and valuable recollections | his dinners felt the magnetism of his presence and he showed especial skill in having to meet his american guests just the famous men in london life whom the american desired to know | choate was a fine conversationalist a wit and a humorist of a high order | his audacity won great triumphs but if exercised by a man less endowed would have brought him continuously into trouble | he had the faculty the art of so directing conversation that at his entertainments everybody had a good time and an invitation always was highly prized | he was appreciated most highly by the english bench and bar | they recognized him as the leader of his profession in the united states | they elected him a bencher of the middle temple the first american to receive that honor after an interval of one hundred and fifty years | choate's witticisms and repartees became the social currency of dinner tables in london and week end parties in the country | choate paid little attention to conventionalities which count for so much and are so rigidly enforced especially in royal circles | i had frequently been at receptions garden parties and other entertainments at buckingham palace in the time of queen victoria and also of king edward | at an evening reception the diplomats representing all the countries in the world stand in a solemn row according to rank and length of service | they are covered with decorations and gold lace | the weight of the gold lace on some of the uniforms of the minor powers is as great as if it were a coat of armor | mr choate under regulations of our diplomatic service could only appear in an ordinary dress suit | while the diplomats stand in solemn array the king and queen go along the line and greet each one with appropriate remarks | nobody but an ambassador and minister gets into that brilliant circle | on one occasion mr choate saw me standing with the other guests outside the charmed circle and immediately left the diplomats came to me and said: i am sure you would like to have a talk with the queen | he went up to her majesty stated the case and who i was and the proposition was most graciously received | i think the royalties were pleased to have a break in the formal etiquette | mr choate treated the occasion so far as i was concerned as if it had been a reception in new york or salem and a distinguished guest wanted to meet the hosts | the gold laced and bejewelled and highly decorated diplomatic circle was paralyzed | mr choate's delightful personality and original conversational powers made him a favorite guest everywhere but he also carried to the platform the distinction which had won for him the reputation of being one of the finest orators in the united states | choate asked at one time when i was almost nightly making speeches at some entertainment: how do you do it | i told him i was risking whatever reputation i had on account of very limited preparation that i did not let these speeches interfere at all with my business but that they were all prepared after i had arrived home from my office late in the afternoon | sometimes they came easy and i reached the dinner in time at other times they were more difficult and i did not arrive till the speaking had begun | then he said: i enjoy making these after dinner addresses more than any other work | it is a perfect delight for me to speak to such an audience but i have not the gift of quick and easy preparation | i accept comparatively few of the constant invitations i receive because when i have to make such a speech i take a corner in the car in the morning going to my office exclude all the intruding public with a newspaper and think all the way down | i continue the same process on my way home in the evening and it takes about three days of this absorption and exclusiveness with some time in the evenings to get an address with which i am satisfied | the delicious humor of these efforts of mr choate and the wonderful way in which he could expose a current delusion or what he thought was one and produce an impression not only on his audience but on the whole community when his speech was printed in the newspapers was a kind of effort which necessarily required preparation | in all the many times i heard him both at home and abroad he never had a failure and sometimes made a sensation | among the many interesting characters whom i met on shipboard was emory storrs a famous chicago lawyer | storrs was a genius of rare talent as an advocator | he also on occasions would make a most successful speech but his efforts were unequal | at one session of the national bar association he carried off all honors at their banquet | of course they wanted him the next year but then he failed entirely to meet their expectations storrs was one of the most successful advocates at the criminal bar especially in murder cases | he rarely failed to get an acquittal for his client | he told me many interesting stories of his experiences | he had a wide circuit owing to his reputation and tried cases far distant from home | i remember one of his experiences in an out of the way county of arkansas | the hotel where they all stopped was very primitive and he had the same table with the judge | the most attractive offer for breakfast by the landlady was buckwheat cakes | she appeared with a jug of molasses and said to the judge: will you have a trickle or a dab | the judge answered: a dab | she then ran her fingers around the jug and slapped a huge amount of molasses on the judge's cakes | storrs said: i think i prefer a trickle | whereupon she dipped her fingers again in the jug and let the drops fall from them on storrs's cakes | the landlady was disappointed because her cakes were unpopular with such distinguished gentlemen | once storrs was going abroad on the same ship with me on a sort of semi diplomatic mission | he was deeply read in english literature and as far as a stranger could be familiar with the places made famous in english and foreign classics | he was one of the factors as chairman of the illinois delegation of the conditions which made possible the nomination of garfield and arthur | in the following presidential campaign he took an active and very useful part | then he brought all the influences that he could use and they were many to bear upon president arthur to make him attorney general | arthur was a strict formalist and could not tolerate the thought of having such an eccentric genius in his cabinet | storrs was not only disappointed but hurt that arthur declined to appoint him | to make him happy his rich clients and he had many of them raised a handsome purse and urged him to make a european trip | then the president added to the pleasure of his journey by giving him an appointment as a sort of roving diplomat with special duties relating to the acute trouble then existing in regard to the admission of american cattle into great britain | they were barred because of a supposed infectious disease | storrs's weakness was neckties | he told me that he had three hundred and sixty five a new one for every day | he would come on deck every morning display his fresh necktie and receive a compliment upon its color and appropriateness and then take from his pocket a huge water proof envelope | from this he would unroll his parchment appointment as a diplomat and the letters he had to almost every one of distinction in europe | on the last day going through the same ceremony he said to me: i am not showing you these things out of vanity but to impress upon you the one thing i most want to accomplish in london | i desire to compel james russell lowell our minister to give me a dinner | probably no man in the world could be selected so antipathetic to lowell as emory storrs | mr lowell told me that he was annoyed that the president should have sent an interloper to meddle with negotiations which he had in successful progress to a satisfactory conclusion | so he invited storrs to dinner and then storrs took no further interest in his diplomatic mission | mr lowell told me that he asked storrs to name whoever he wanted to invite | he supposed from his general analysis of the man that storrs would want the entire royal family | he was delighted to find that the selection was confined entirely to authors artists and scientists | on my return trip mr storrs was again a fellow passenger | he was very enthusiastic over the places of historic interest he had visited and eloquent and graphic in descriptions of them and of his own intense feelings when he came in contact with things he had dreamed of most of his life |  but he said i will tell you of my greatest adventure | i was in the picture gallery at dresden and in that small room where hangs raphael's 'madonna '| i was standing before this wonderful masterpiece of divine inspiration when i felt the room crowded | i discovered that the visitors were all americans and all looking at me | i said to them: 'ladies and gentlemen you are here in the presence of the most wonderful picture ever painted | if you study it you can see that there is little doubt but with all his genius raphael in this work had inspiration from above and yet you as americans instead of availing yourselves of the rarest of opportunities have your eyes bent on me | i am only a chicago lawyer wearing a chicago made suit of clothes '|  a gentleman stepped forward and said: 'mr | storrs on behalf of your countrymen and countrywomen present i wish to say that you are of more interest to us than all the works of raphael put together because we understand that james russell lowell united states minister to great britain gave you a dinner ' | one other incident in my acquaintance with mr storrs was original | i heard the story of it both from him and lord coleridge and they did not differ materially | lord coleridge chief justice of england was a most welcome visitor when he came to the united states | he received invitations from the state bar associations everywhere to accept their hospitality | i conducted him on part of his trip and found him one of the most able and delightful of men | he was a very fine speaker more in our way than the english and made a first class impression upon all the audiences he addressed | at chicago lord coleridge was entertained by the bar association of the state of illinois | storrs who was an eminent member of the bar of that state came to him and said: now lord coleridge you have been entertained by the bar association | i want you to know the real men of the west the captains of industry who have created this city built our railroads and made the great west what it is | coleridge replied that he did not want to go outside bar associations and he could not think of making another speech in chicago | storrs assured him it would be purely a private affair and no speeches permitted | the dinner was very late but when they sat down lord coleridge noticed a distinguished looking gentleman instead of eating his dinner correcting a manuscript | he said: mr storrs i understood there was to be no speaking |  well said storrs you can't get americans together unless some one takes the floor | that man with the manuscript is general and senator john a logan one of our most distinguished citizens | just then a reporter came up to storrs and said: mr storrs we have the slips of your speech in our office and it is now set up with the laughter and applause in their proper places | the editor sent me up to see if you wanted to add anything | of course lord coleridge was in for it and had to make another speech | the cause of the lateness of the dinner is the most original incident that i know of in historic banquets | storrs received great fees and had a large income but was very careless about his business matters | one of his creditors obtained a judgment against him | the lawyer for this creditor was a guest at this dinner and asked the landlord of the hotel if the dinner had been paid for in advance | the landlord answered in the affirmative and so the lawyer telephoned to the sheriff and had the dinner levied upon | the sheriff refused to allow it to be served until the judgment was satisfied | there were at least a hundred millions of dollars represented among the guests packers elevator men real estate operators and grain operators but millionaires and multimillionaires in dress suits at a banquet never have any money on their persons | so it was an hour or more before the sheriff was satisfied | lord coleridge was intensely amused and related the adventure with great glee | several years afterwards lord coleridge had some difficulty in his family which came into the courts of england | i do not remember just what it was all about but storrs in reading the gossip which came across the cable decided against the chief justice | lord coleridge told me he received from storrs a cable reading something like this: i have seen in our papers about your attitude in the suit now pending | i therefore inform you that as far as possible i withdraw the courtesies which i extended to you in chicago | in this unique way storrs cancelled the dinner which was given and seized by the sheriff years ago | i met storrs many times and he was always not only charming but fascinating | he was very witty full of anecdotes and told a story with dramatic effect | except for his eccentricities he might have taken the highest place in his profession | as it was he acquired such fame that an admirer has written a very good biography of him |xvii  governors of new york state there is nothing more interesting than to see the beginning of a controversy which makes history | it is my good fortune to have been either a spectator or a participant on several occasions | william m tweed was at the height of his power | he was the master of new york city and controlled the legislature of the state | the rapid growth and expansion of new york city had necessitated a new charter or very radical improvements in the existing one | tweed as chairman of the senate committee on cities had staged a large and spectacular hearing at the state capitol at albany | it was attended by a large body of representative citizens from the metropolis | some spoke for civic and commercial bodies and there were also other prominent men who were interested | everybody interested in public affairs in albany at the time attended | not only was there a large gathering of legislators but there were also in the audience judges lawyers and politicians from all parts of the state | after hearing from the chamber of commerce and various reform organizations mr samuel j tilden came forward with a complete charter | it was soon evident that he was better prepared and informed on the subject than any one present | he knew intimately the weaknesses of the present charter and had thought out with great care and wisdom what was needed in new legislation | from the contemptuous way in which senator tweed treated mr tilden scouted his plans and ridiculed his propositions it was evident that the whole scheme had been staged as a state wide spectacle to humiliate and end the political career of samuel j tilden | in answer to tilden's protest against this treatment tweed loudly informed him that he represented no one but himself that he had neither influence nor standing in the city that he was an intermeddler with things that did not concern him and a general nuisance | mr tilden turned ashy white and showed evidences of suppressed rage and vindictiveness more intense than i ever saw in any one before and abruptly left the hearing | i knew mr tilden very well and from contact with him in railroad matters had formed a high opinion of his ability and acquirements | he had a keen analytic mind tireless industry and a faculty for clarifying difficulties and untangling apparently impossible problems to a degree that amounted to genius | in reference to what had happened i said to a friend: mr tweed must be very confident of his position and of his record for he has deliberately defied and invited the attacks of a relentless and merciless opponent by every insult which could wound the pride and incite the hatred of the man so ridiculed and abused | mr tilden is a great lawyer | he has made a phenomenal success financially he has powerful associates in financial and business circles and is master of his time for any purpose to which he chooses to apply it | it was not long before one of the most remarkable and exhaustive investigations ever conducted by an individual into public records books ledgers bank accounts and contracts revealed to the public the whole system of governing the city | this master mind solved the problems so that they were plain to the average citizen as the simplest sum in arithmetic or that two and two make four | the result was the destruction of the power of tweed and his associates of their prosecution and conviction and of the elevation of samuel j tilden to a state and national figure of the first importance | he not only became in the public mind a leader of reforms in government municipal state and national but embodied in the popular imagination reform itself | mr tilden carried this same indefatigable industry and power of organization into a canvass for governor | his agencies reached not only the counties and towns but the election districts of the state | he called into existence a new power in politics the young men | the old leaders were generally against him but he discovered in every locality ambitious resourceful and courageous youngsters and made them his lieutenants | this unparalleled preparation made him the master of his party and the governor of the state | after the election he invited me to come and see him at the executive mansion in albany and in the course of the conversation he said: in your speeches in the campaign against me you were absolutely fair and as a fair and open minded opponent i want to have a frank talk | i am governor of the state elected upon an issue which is purely local | the democratic party is at present without principles or any definite issue on which to appeal to the public | if i am to continue in power we must find an issue | the erie canal is not only a state affair but a national one | its early construction opened the great northwest and it was for years the only outlet to the seaboard | the public not only in the state of new york but in the west believes that there has been and is corruption in the construction and management of the canal | this great waterway requires continuing contracts for continuing repairs and the people believe that these contracts are given to favorites and that the work is either not performed at all or is badly done | i believe that matter ought to be looked into and the result will largely justify the suspicion prevalent in the public mind | i want your judgment on the question and what will be the effect upon me | i then frankly answered him: governor there is no doubt it will be a popular movement but you know that the canal contractors control the machinery of your party and i cannot tell what the effect of that may be upon what you desire which is a second term |  those contractors he said are good democrats and their ability to secure the contracts depends upon democratic supremacy | a prosecution against them has been tried so often that they have little fear of either civil or criminal actions and i think they will accept the issue as the only one which will keep their party in power | it is a part of the history of the time that he made the issue so interesting that he became a national figure of the first importance and afterwards the candidate of his party for president of the united states | not only that but he so impressed the people that popular judgment is still divided as to whether or not he was rightfully elected president | once i was coming from the west after a tour of inspection and when we left albany the conductor told me that governor tilden was on the train | i immediately called and found him very uncomfortable because he said he was troubled with boils | i invited him into the larger compartment which i had and made him as comfortable as possible | his conversation immediately turned upon the second term and he asked what i as a republican thought of his prospects as the result of his administration | we had hardly entered upon the subject when a very excited gentleman burst into the compartment and said: governor i have been looking for you everywhere | i went to your office at the capitol and to the executive mansion but learned you were here and barely caught the train | you know who i am |  the governor knew he was mayor of a city |  i want to see you confidentially | the governor said to him: i have entire confidence in my republican friend here | you can trust him | go on | i knew the mayor very well and under ordinary conditions he would have insisted on the interview with the governor being private and personal | but he was so excited and bursting with rage that he went right on | the mayor fairly shouted: it is the station agent of the new york central railroad in our city of whom i complain | he is active in politics and controls the democratic organization in our county | he is working to prevent myself and my friends and even ex governor seymour from being delegates to the national convention | it is to the interest of our party in fact i may say the salvation of our party in our county that this new york central agent be either removed or silenced and i want you to see mr vanderbilt on the subject | the governor sympathized with the mayor and dismissed him | then in a quizzical way he asked me: do you know this agent |  yes i answered |  what do you think of him |  i know nothing about his political activities i answered but he is one of the most efficient employees of the company in the state |  well said the governor i am glad to hear you say so | he was down to see me the other night in fact i sent for him and i formed a very high opinion of his judgment and ability | as a matter of fact the governor had selected him to accomplish this very result which the mayor had said would ruin the party in the county | when the new york democratic delegation left the city for the democratic national convention they had engaged a special train to leave from the grand central station | i went down to see that the arrangements were perfected for its movement | it was a hilarious crowd and the sides of the cars were strung with tilden banners | mr tilden was there also to see them off | after bidding good by to the leaders and with a whispered conference with each the mass of delegates and especially reporters of whom there was a crowd wished to engage him in conversation | he spied me and immediately hurried me into one of the alcoves apparently for a private conversation | the crowd of course gathered around anxious to know what it was all about | he asked me a few questions about the health of my family and then added: don't leave me | i want to avoid all these people and we will talk until the train is off and the crowd disperses | life was a burden for me the rest of the day and evening made so by the newspaper men and democratic politicians trying to find out what the mysterious chief had revealed to me in the alcove of the grand central | i was very much gratified when meeting him after the fierce battles for the presidency were over to have him grasp me by the hand and say: you were about the only one who treated me absolutely fairly during the campaign | i love little incidents about great men | mr tilden was intensely human and a great man | doctor buckley who was at the head of the methodist book concern in new york and one of the most delightful of men told me that there came into his office one day a methodist preacher from one of the mining districts of pennsylvania who said to him: my church burned down | we had no insurance | we are poor people and therefore i have come to new york to raise money to rebuild it | the doctor told him that new york was overrun from all parts of the country with applicants for help and that he thought he would have great difficulty in his undertaking |  well the preacher said i am going to see mr |tilden  doctor buckley could not persuade him that his mission was next to impossible and so this rural clergyman started for gramercy park | when he returned he told the doctor of his experience |  i rang the bell he said and when the door was opened i saw governor tilden coming down the stairs | i rushed in and told him hastily who i was before the man at the door could stop me and he invited me into his library | i stated my mission and he said he was so overwhelmed with applications that he did not think he could do anything | 'but governor ' i said 'my case differs from all others | my congregation is composed of miners honest hardworking people | they have hitherto been republicans on the protection issue but they were so impressed by you as a great reformer that they all voted for you in the last election '| the governor said: 'tell that story again '| so i started again to tell him about my church but he interrupted me saying: 'not that but about the election '| so i told him again about their having on account of their admiration for him as a reformer turned from the republican party and voted the democratic ticket | then the governor said: 'well i think you have a most meritorious case and so i will give you all i have ' | doctor buckley interrupted him hastily saying: great heavens are you going to build a cathedral |  no answered the clergyman all he had in his pocket was two dollars and fifty cents | governor tilden had many followers and friends whose admiration for him amounted almost to adoration | they believed him capable of everything and they were among the most intelligent and able men of the country | john bigelow journalist author and diplomat was always sounding his greatness both with tongue and pen | abram s hewitt was an equally enthusiastic friend and admirer | both of these gentlemen the latter especially were i think abler than mr tilden but did not have his hypnotic power | i was dining one night with mr hewitt whose dinners were always events to be remembered when mr tilden became the subject of discussion | after incidents illustrating his manifold distinctions had been narrated mr hewitt said that mr tilden was the only one in america and outside of royalties in europe who had some blue labelled johannisberger | this famous wine from the vineyards of prince metternich on the rhine was at that time reported to be absorbed by the royal families of europe | our host said: the bouquet of this wonderful beverage is unusually penetrating and diffusing and a proof is that one night at a dinner in the summer with the windows all open the guests noticed this peculiar aroma in the air | i said to them that governor tilden had opened a bottle of his johannisberger | the governor's residence was on the other side of gramercy park from mr hewitt's | the matter was so extraordinary that everybody at the table went across the park and when they were admitted they found the governor in his library enjoying his bottle of blue labelled johannisberger | when mr tilden was elected governor my friend general husted was speaker of the assembly which was largely republican | the governor asked general husted to come down in the evening because he wanted to consult him about the improvements and alterations necessary for the executive mansion and to have the speaker secure the appropriation | during the discussion the governor placed before the speaker a bottle of rare whiskey with the usual accompaniments | in front of the governor was a bottle of his johannisberger and a small liqueur glass a little larger than a thimble from which the governor would from time to time taste a drop of this rare and exquisite fluid | the general after a while could not restrain his curiosity any longer and said: governor what is that you are drinking | the governor explained its value and the almost utter impossibility of securing any |  well governor said speaker husted i never saw any before and i think i will try it | he seized the bottle emptied it in his goblet and announced to the astonished executive that he was quite right in his estimate of its excellence | the governor lost a bottle of his most cherished treasure but received from the republican legislature all the appropriation he desired for the executive mansion | it has been my good fortune to know well the governors of our state of new york commencing with edmund d morgan | with many of them i was on terms of close intimacy | i have already spoken of governors seymour fenton dix tilden cleveland and roosevelt | it might be better to confine my memory to those who have joined the majority | lucius robinson was an excellent executive of the business type as also were alonzo b cornell and levi p morton | frank s black was in many ways original | he was an excellent governor but very different from the usual routine | in the spanish american war he had a definite idea that the national guard of our state should not go into the service of the united states as regiments but as individual volunteers | the seventh regiment which was the crack organization of the guard was severely criticised because they did not volunteer | they refused to go except as the seventh regiment and their enemies continued to assail them as tin soldiers | general louis fitzgerald and colonel appleton came to me very much disturbed by this condition | general russell a alger secretary of war was an intimate friend of mine and i went to washington and saw him and the president on the acute condition affecting the reputation of the seventh regiment | general alger said: we are about to make a desperate assault upon the fortifications of havana | of course there will be many casualties and the fighting most severe | will the seventh join that expedition | the answer of general fitzgerald and colonel appleton was emphatic that the seventh would march with full ranks on the shortest possible notice | governor black would not change his view of how the national guard should go and so the seventh was never called | it seems only proper that i should make a record of this patriotic proposition made by this organization | governor black developed after he became governor and especially after he had retired from office into a very effective orator | he had a fine presence and an excellent delivery | he was fond of preparing epigrams and became a master in this sort of literature | when he had occasion to deliver an address it would be almost wholly made up of these detached gems each perfect in itself | the only other of our american orators who cultivated successfully this style of speech was senator john j ingalls of kansas | it is a style very difficult to attain or to make successful | david b hill was an extraordinary man in many ways | he was governor for three terms and united states senator for one | his whole life was politics | he was a trained lawyer and an excellent one but his heart and soul was in party control winning popular elections and the art of governing | he consolidated the rural elements of his party so effectively that he compelled tammany hall to submit to his leadership and to recognize him as its master | for many years and winning in every contest governor hill controlled the organization and the policies of the democratic party of the state of new york | in a plain way he was an effective speaker but in no sense an orator | he contested with cleveland for the presidency but in that case ran against a stronger and bigger personality than he had ever encountered and lost | he rose far above the average and made his mark upon the politics of his state and upon the united states senate while he was a member | levi p morton brought to the governorship business ability which had made him one of the great merchants and foremost bankers | as governor of the state of new york united states minister to france congressman and vice president of the united states he filled every position with grace dignity and ability | a lovable personality made him most popular | roswell p flower after a successful career as a banker developed political ambitions | he had a faculty of making friends and had hosts of them | he was congressman and then governor | while the democratic organization was hostile to him he was of the mark hanna type and carried his successful business methods into the canvass for the nomination and the campaign for the election and was successful | passing through albany while he was governor i stopped over to pay my respects | i was very fond of him personally | when i rang the door bell of the executive mansion and inquired for the governor the servant said: the governor is very ill and can see nobody | then i asked him to tell the governor when he was able to receive a message that chauncey depew called and expressed his deep regret for his illness | suddenly the governor popped out from the parlor and seized me by the hand and said: chauncey come in | i was never so glad to see anybody in my life | he told me the legislature had adjourned and left on his hands several thousands of thirty days bills that is bills on which he had thirty days to sign or veto or let them become laws by not rejecting them | so he had to deny himself to everybody to get the leisure to read them over and form decisions |  do you know chauncey he said this is a new business to me | most of these bills are on subjects which i never have examined studied or thought about | it is very difficult to form a wise judgment and i want to do in each case just what is right | for the moment he became silent seemingly absorbed by anxious thoughts about these bills | then suddenly he exclaimed: by the way chauncey you've done a great deal of thinking in your life and i never have done any except on business | does intense thinking affect you as it does me by upsetting your stomach and making you throw up |  no governor i answered if it did i fear i would be in a chronic state of indigestion | while he was governor he canvassed the state in a private car and made many speeches | in a plain homely man to man talk he was very effective on the platform | his train stopped at a station in a republican community where there were few democrats while i was addressing a republican meeting in the village | when i had finished my speech i said to the crowd which was a large one: governor flower is at the station and as i passed he had very few people listening to him | let us all go over and give him an audience | the proposition was received with cheers | i went ahead got in at the other end of the governor's car from the one where he was speaking from the platform | as this republican crowd began to pour in it was evident as i stood behind him without his knowing of my presence that he was highly delighted | he shouted: fellow citizens i told you they were coming | they are coming from the mountains from the hills and from the valleys | it is the stampede from the republican party and into our ranks and for our ticket | this is the happiest evidence i have received of the popularity of our cause and the success of our ticket | standing behind him i made a signal for cheers which was heartily responded to and the governor turning around saw the joke grasped me cordially by the hand and the whole crowd including the veteran and hardened democrats on the car joined in the hilarity of the occasion | he came to me when he was running for the second time for congress and said that some of the people of his district were anxious for me to deliver an address for one of their pet charities and that the meeting would be held in harlem naming the evening | i told him i would go | he came for me in his carriage and i said: governor please do not talk to me on the way up | i was so busy that i have had no time since i left my office this afternoon to prepare this address and i want every minute while we are riding to the meeting | the meeting was a large one | the governor took the chair and introduced me in this original way: ladies and gentlemen he said i want to say about chauncey depew whom i am now going to introduce to you as the lecturer of the evening that he is no demosthenes because he can beat demosthenes out of sight | he prepared his speech in the carriage in which i was bringing him up here and he don't have like the old greek to chew pebble stones in order to make a speech | governor flower in a conservative way was a successful trader in the stock market | when he felt he had a sure point he would share it with a few friends | he took special delight in helping in this way men who had little means and no knowledge of the art of moneymaking | there were a great many benefited by his bounty | i was dining one night with the gridiron club at washington and before me was a plate of radishes | the newspaper man next to me asked if i would object to having the radishes removed | i said: there is no odor or perfume from them | what is the matter with the radishes | after they were taken away he told me his story |  governor flower he said was very kind to me as he invariably was to all newspaper men | he asked me one day how much i had saved in my twenty years in journalism | i told him ten thousand dollars | he said: 'that is not enough for so long a period | let me have the money '| so i handed over to him my bank account | in a few weeks he told me that my ten thousand dollars had become twenty and i could have them if i wished | i said: 'no you are doing far better than i could | keep it '| in about a month or more my account had grown to thirty thousand dollars | then the governor on a very hot day went fishing somewhere off the long island coast | he was a very large heavy man became overheated and on his return drank a lot of ice water and ate a bunch of radishes | he died that afternoon | there was a panic in the stocks which were his favorites the next day and they fell out of sight | the result was that i lost my fortune of ten thousand dollars and also my profit of twenty | since then the sight of a radish makes me sick |xviii  fifty six years with the new york central railroad company heredity has much to do with a man's career | the village of peekskill on the hudson about forty miles from new york was in the early days the market town of a large section of the surrounding country extending over to the state of connecticut | it was a farming region and its products destined for new york city were shipped by sloops on the hudson from the wharfs at peekskill and the return voyage brought back the merchandise required by the country | my father and his brother owned the majority of the sloops engaged in this at that time almost the only transportation | the sloops were succeeded by steamboats in which my people were also interested | when commodore vanderbilt entered into active rivalry with the other steamboat lines between new york and albany the competition became very serious | newer and faster boats were rapidly built | these racers would reach the bay of peekskill in the late afternoon and the younger population of the village would be on the banks of the river enthusiastically applauding their favorites | among well known boats whose names and achievements excited as much interest and aroused as much partisanship and sporting spirit as do now famous race horses or baseball champions were the following: mary powell dean richmond the alida and the hendrick hudson | i remember as if it were yesterday when the hudson river railroad had reached peekskill and the event was locally celebrated | the people came in as to a county fair from fifty miles around | when the locomotive steamed into the station many of those present had never seen one | the engineer was continuously blowing his whistle to emphasize the great event | this produced much consternation and confusion among the horses as all farmers were there with their families in carriages or wagons | i recall one team of young horses which were driven to frenzy their owner was unable to control them but he kept them on the road while they ran away with a wild dash over the hills | in telling this story as illustrating how recent is railway development in the united states at a dinner abroad i stated that as far as i knew and believed those horses were so frightened that they could not be stopped and were still running | a very successful and serious minded captain of industry among the guests sternly rebuked me by saying: sir that is impossible horses were never born that could run for twenty five years without stopping | american exaggeration was not so well known among our friends on the other side then as it is now | as we boys of the village were gathered on the banks of the hudson cheering our favorite steamers or watching with eager interest the movements of the trains a frequent discussion would be about our ambitions in life | every young fellow would state a dream which he hoped but never expected to be realized | i was charged by my companions with having the greatest imagination and with painting more pictures in the skies than any of them | this was because i stated that in politics for i was a great admirer of william h seward then senator from new york i expected to be a united states senator and in business because then the largest figure in the business world was commodore vanderbilt i hoped to become president of the hudson river railroad | it is one of the strangest incidents of what seemed the wild imaginings of a village boy that in the course of long years both these expectations were realized | when i entered the service of the railroad on the first of january 1866 the vanderbilt system consisted of the hudson river and harlem railroads the harlem ending at chatham 128 miles and the hudson river at albany 140 miles long | the vanderbilt system now covers 20 000 miles | the total railway mileage of the whole united states at that time was 36 000 and now it is 261 000 miles | my connection with the new york central railroad covers practically the whole period of railway construction expansion and development in the united states | it is a singular evidence of the rapidity of our country's growth and of the way which that growth has steadily followed the rails that all this development of states of villages growing into cities of scattered communities becoming great manufacturing centres of an internal commerce reaching proportions where it has greater volume than the foreign interchanges of the whole world has come about during a period covered by the official career of a railroad man who is still in the service: an attorney in 1866 a vice president in 1882 president in 1885 chairman of the board of directors in 1899 and still holds that office | there is no such record in the country for continuous service with one company which during the whole period has been controlled by one family | this service of more than half a century has been in every way satisfactory | it is a pleasure to see the fourth generation inheriting the ability of the father grandfather and great grandfather still active in the management | i want to say that in thus linking my long relationship with the railroads to this marvellous development i do not claim to have been better than the railway officers who during this time have performed their duties to the best of their ability | i wish also to pay tribute to the men of original genius of vision and daring to whom so much is due in the expansion and improvement of the american railway systems | commodore vanderbilt was one of the most remarkable men our country has produced | he was endowed with wonderful foresight grasp of difficult situations ability to see opportunities before others to solve serious problems and the courage of his convictions | he had little education or early advantages but was eminently successful in everything he undertook | as a boy on staten island he foresaw that upon transportation depended the settlement growth and prosperity of this nation | he began with a small boat running across the harbor from staten island to new york | very early in his career he acquired a steamboat and in a few years was master of long island sound | he then extended his operations to the hudson river and speedily acquired the dominating ownership in boats competing between new york and albany | when gold was discovered in california he started a line on the atlantic side of the isthmus of darien and secured from the government of nicaragua the privilege of crossing the isthmus for a transportation system through its territory and then established a line of steamers on the pacific to san francisco | in a short time the old established lines both on the atlantic and the pacific were compelled to sell out to him | then he entered the transatlantic trade with steamers to europe | with that vision which is a gift and cannot be accounted for he decided that the transportation work of the future was on land and in railroads | he abandoned the sea and his first enterprise was the purchase of the new york and harlem railroad which was only one hundred and twenty eight miles long | the road was bankrupt and its road bed and equipment going from bad to worse | the commodore reconstructed the line re equipped it and by making it serviceable to its territory increased its traffic and turned its business from deficiency into profit | this was in 1864 | the commodore became president and his son william h vanderbilt vice president | he saw that the extension of the harlem was not advisable and so secured the hudson river railroad running from new york to albany and became its president in 1865 | it was a few months after this when he and his son invited me to become a member of their staff | the station of the harlem railroad in the city of new york was at that time at fourth avenue and twenty sixth street and that of the hudson river railroad at chambers street near the north river | in a few years william h vanderbilt purchased the ground for the harlem railroad company where is now located the grand central terminal and by the acquisition by the new york central and hudson river railroad of the harlem railroad the trains of the new york central were brought around into the grand central station | in 1867 two years after mr vanderbilt had acquired the hudson river railroad he secured the control of the new york central which ran from albany to buffalo | this control was continued through the lake shore on one side of the lakes and the michigan central on the other to chicago | subsequently the vanderbilt system was extended to cincinnati and st louis | it was thus in immediate connection with the west and northwest centering in chicago and the southwest at cincinnati and st louis | by close connection and affiliation with the chicago and northwestern railway company the vanderbilt system was extended beyond to mississippi | i became director in the new york central in 1874 and in the chicago and northwestern in 1877 | it has been my good fortune to meet with more or less intimacy many of the remarkable men in every department of life but i think commodore vanderbilt was the most original | i had been well acquainted for some years both with the commodore and his son william h when i became attorney my relations were more intimate than those usually existing | i was in daily consultation with the commodore during the ten years prior to his death and with his son from 1866 to 1885 when he died | the commodore was constantly because of his wealth and power importuned by people who wished to interest him in their schemes | most of the great and progressive enterprises of his time were presented to him | he would listen patiently ask a few questions and in a short time grasp the whole subject | then with wonderful quickness and unerring judgment he would render his decision | no one knew by what process he arrived at these conclusions | they seemed to be the results as much of inspiration as of insight | the civil war closed in 1865 and one of its lessons had been the necessity for more railroads | the country had discovered that without transportation its vast and fertile territories could neither be populated nor made productive | every mile of railroad carried settlers opened farms and increased the national resources and wealth | the economical and critical conditions of the country owing to the expansion of the currency and banking conditions facilitated and encouraged vast schemes of railroad construction | this and a wild speculation resulted in the panic of 1873 | nearly the whole country went bankrupt | the recovery was rapid and the constructive talent of the republic saw that the restoration of credit and prosperity must be led by railway solvency | in august 1874 commodore vanderbilt invited the representatives of the other and competitive lines to a conference at saratoga | owing however to the jealousies and hostilities of the period only the new york central the pennsylvania and the erie railways were represented | the eastern railway situation was then dominated by commodore vanderbilt colonel thomas a scott of the pennsylvania and john w garrett of the baltimore and ohio | both scott and garrett were original men and empire builders | there was neither governmental nor state regulation | the head of a railway system had practically unlimited power in the operation of his road | the people were so anxious for the construction of railways that they offered every possible inducement to capital | the result was a great deal of unprofitable construction and immense losses to the promoters | these able men saw that there was no possibility of railway construction operation and efficiency with a continuance of unrestricted competition | it has taken from 1874 until 1920 to educate the railway men the shippers and the government to a realization of the fact that transportation facilities required for the public necessities can only be had by the freest operations and the strictest government regulations that the solution of the problem is a system so automatic that public arbitration shall decide the justice of the demands of labor and rates be advanced to meet the decision and that public authority also shall take into consideration the other factors of increased expenses and adequate facilities for the railroads and that maintenance and the highest efficiency must be preserved and also necessary extensions | to satisfy and attract capital there must be the assurance of a reasonable return upon the investment | the meeting called by commodore vanderbilt in 1874 at saratoga was an epoch making event | we must remember the railway management of the country was in the absolute control of about four men two of whom were also largest owners of the lines they managed | fierce competition and cutting of rates brought on utter demoralization among shippers who could not calculate on the cost of transportation and great favoritism to localities and individuals by irresponsible freight agents who controlled the rates | under these influences railway earnings were fluctuating and uncertain | improvements were delayed and the people on the weaker lines threatened with bankruptcy | public opinion however believed this wild competition to be the only remedy for admitted railway evils | as an illustration of the change of public opinion and the better understanding of the railway problems this occurred in the month of october 1920 | a committee of shippers and producers representing the farmers manufacturers and business men along a great railway system came to see the manager of the railroad and said to him: we have been all wrong in the past | our effort has always been for lower rates regardless of the necessities of the railways | we have tried to get them by seeking bids from competing lines for our shipments and by appealing to the interstate commerce commission | the expenses of the railroads have been increased by demands of labor by constantly rising prices and cost of rails cars terminals and facilities but we have been against allowing the railroads to meet this increased cost of operation by adequate advances in rates | we now see that this course was starving the railroads and we are suffering for want of cars and locomotives to move our traffic and terminals to care for it | we are also suffering because the old treatment of the railroads has frightened capital so that the roads cannot get money to maintain their lines and make necessary improvements to meet the demands of business | we know now that rates make very little difference because they can be absorbed in our business | what we must have is facilities to transport our products and we want to help the railroads to get money and credit and again we emphasize our whole trouble is want of cars locomotives and terminal facilities | happily public opinion was reflected in the last congress in the passage of the cummins esch bill which is the most enlightened and adaptable legislation of the last quarter of a century | to return to the conference at saratoga the new york central the pennsylvania and the erie came to the conclusion that they must have the co operation of the baltimore and ohio | as mr garrett president and controlling owner of that road would not come to the conference the members decided that the emergency was so great that they must go to him | this was probably the most disagreeable thing commodore vanderbilt ever did | the marvellous success of his wonderful life had been won by fighting and defeating competitors | the peril was so great that they went as associates and the visit interested the whole country and so enlarged mr garrett's opinion of his power that he rejected their offer and said he would act independently | a railway war immediately followed and in a short time bankruptcy threatened all lines and none more than the baltimore and ohio | the trunk lines then got together and entered into an agreement to stabilize rates and carry them into effect | they appointed as commissioner mr albert fink one of the ablest railway men of that time | mr fink's administration was successful but the rivalries and jealousies of the lines and the frequent breaking of agreements were too much for one man | the presidents and general managers of all the railroads east of chicago then met and formed an association and this association was a legislative body without any legal authority to enforce its decrees | it had however two effects: the disputes which arose were publicly discussed and the merits of each side so completely demonstrated that the decision of the association came to be accepted as just and right | then the verdict of the association had behind it the whole investment and banking community and the press | the weight of this was sufficient to compel obedience to its decisions by the most rebellious member | no executive could continue to hold his position while endeavoring to break up the association | it is one of the most gratifying events of my life that my associates in this great and powerful association elected me their president and i continued in office until the supreme court in a momentous decision declared that the railroads came under the provision of the sherman anti trust law and dissolved these associations in the east west and south | it was a liberal education of the railway problems to meet the men who became members of this association | most of them left an indelible impression upon the railway conditions of the time and of the railway policies of the future | all were executives of great ability and several rare constructive geniuses | in our system there was john newell president of the lake shore and michigan southern a most capable and efficient manager | henry b ledyard president of the michigan central was admirably trained for the great responsibilities which he administered so well | there was william bliss president of the boston and albany who had built up a line to be one of the strongest of the new england group | melville e ingalls president of the cleveland cincinnati chicago and st louis had combined various weak and bankrupt roads and made them an efficient organization | he had also rehabilitated and put in useful working and paying condition the chesapeake and ohio | ingalls told me a very good story of himself | he had left the village in maine where he was born and after graduation from college and admission to the bar had settled in boston | to protect the interests of his clients he had moved to cincinnati ohio and rescued railroad properties in which they were interested | when his success was complete and he had under his control a large and successfully working railway system he made a visit to his birthplace | one evening he went down to the store where the village congress was assembled sitting on the barrels and the counter | they welcomed him very cordially and then an inquisitive farmer said to him: melville it is reported around here that you are getting a salary of nigh unto ten thousand dollars a year | mr ingalls who was getting several times that amount modestly admitted the ten which was a prodigious sum in that rural neighborhood | whereupon the old farmer voiced the local sentiment by saying: well melville that shows what cheek and circumstances can do for a man | i recall an incident connected with one of the ablest of the executives in our system | one day we had a conference of rival interests and many executives were there in the effort to secure an adjustment | for this purpose we had an arbitrator | after a most exhausting day in the battle of wits and experience for advantages i arrived home used up but after a half hour's sleep i awoke refreshed and consulting my diary found i was down for a speech at a banquet at delmonico's that night | i arrived late the intervening time being devoted to intensive and rapid preparation | i was called early | the speech attracted attention and occupied a column in the morning's papers | i was in bed at eleven o'clock and had between seven and eight hours' refreshing sleep | on arriving at our meeting place the next morning one of the best known presidents took me aside and said: chauncey by making speeches such as you did last night you are losing the confidence of the people | they say you cannot prepare such speeches and give proper attention to your business |  well i said to him my friend did i lose anything before the arbitrator yesterday | he answered very angrily: no you gained entirely too much |  well i then said i am very fresh this morning | but what did you do last night | he answered that he was so exhausted that he went to delmonico's and ordered the best dinner possible | then he went on to say: a friend told me a little game was going on up stairs and in a close room filled with tobacco smoke i played poker until two o'clock and drank several high balls | the result is i think we better postpone this meeting for i do not feel like doing anything to day |  my dear friend i said you will get the credit of giving your whole time to business while i am by doing what refreshes my mind discredited because it gets in the papers | i shall keep my method regardless of consequences | he kept his and although much younger than myself died years ago | george b roberts president of the pennsylvania was a very wise executive and of all around ability | frank thompson vice president and afterwards president of the same road was one of the ablest operating officers of his time and a most delightful personality | mr a j cassatt was a great engineer and possessed rare foresight and vision | he brought the pennsylvania into new york city through a tunnel under the hudson river continued the tunnel across the city to the east river and then under the river to connect with the long island which he had acquired for his system | d w caldwell president of the new york chicago and st louis added to railway ability wit and humor | he told a good story on mr george roberts | caldwell was at one time division superintendent under president roberts | he had obtained permission to build a new station house in whose plan and equipment he was deeply interested | it was mr roberts's habit by way of showing his subordinates that he was fully aware of their doings to either add or take away something from their projects | caldwell prepared a station house according to his ideas and to prevent roberts from making any essential changes he added an unnecessary bay window to the front of the passengers' room | roberts carefully examined the plans and said: remove that bay window and then approved the plan and caldwell had what he wanted | caldwell used to tell of another occasion when on a western line he had over him a very severe and harsh disciplinarian as president | this president was a violent prohibitionist and had heard that caldwell was a bonvivant | he sent for caldwell to discipline or discharge him | after a long and tiresome journey caldwell arrived at the president's house | his first greeting was: mr caldwell do you drink | caldwell wholly unsuspicious answered: thank you mr president i am awfully tired and will take a little rye | mr e b thomas president of the lehigh valley was a valuable member of the association | the baltimore and ohio as usual had its president mr charles f mayer accompanied by an able staff | the erie was represented by one of the most capable and genial of its many presidents mr john king | king was a capital story teller and among them i remember this one: at one time he was general manager of the baltimore and ohio under john w garrett | in order to raise money for his projected extensions garrett had gone to europe | the times were financially very difficult | johns hopkins the famous philanthropist died | his immortal monument is the johns hopkins university and medical school | everybody in baltimore attended the funeral | among the leading persons present was another john king a banker who was hopkins's executor | a messenger boy rushed in with a cable for john king and handed it to john king the executor who sat at the head of the mourners | he read it and then passed it along so that each one could read it until it reached john king of the baltimore and ohio who sat at the foot of the line | the cable read as follows: present my sympathies to the family and my high appreciation of mr johns hopkins and borrow from the executor all you can at five per cent |garrett  commodore vanderbilt was succeeded in the presidency by his son william h vanderbilt who was then past forty years old and had been a successful farmer on staten island | he was active in neighborhood affairs and in politics | this brought him in close contact with the people and was of invaluable benefit to him when he became president of a great railroad corporation | he also acquired familiarity in railway management as a director of one on staten island | mr william h vanderbilt was a man of great ability and his education made him in many ways an abler man than his father for the new conditions he had to meet | but like many a capable son of a famous father he did not receive the credit which was due him because of the overshadowing reputation of the commodore | nevertheless on several occasions he exhibited the highest executive qualities | one of the great questions of the time was the duty of railroads to the cities in which they terminated and the decision of the roads south of new york to have lower rates to philadelphia and baltimore | new york felt so secure in the strength of its unrivalled harbor and superior shipping facilities that the merchants and financiers were not alarmed | very soon however there was such a diversion of freight from new york as to threaten very seriously its export trade and the superiority of its port | the commercial leaders of the city called upon mr vanderbilt who after the conference said to them: i will act in perfect harmony with you and will see that the new york central railroad protects new york city regardless of the effect upon its finances | the city representatives said: that is very fine and we will stand together | mr vanderbilt immediately issued a statement that the rates to the seaboard should be the same to all ports and that the new york central would meet the lowest rates to any port by putting the same in effect on its own lines | the result was the greatest railroad war since railroads began to compete | rates fell fifty per cent and it was a question of the survival of the fittest | commerce returned to new york and the competing railroads to avoid bankruptcy got together and formed the trunk line association | new york city has not always remembered how intimately bound is its prosperity with that of the great railroad whose terminal is within its city limits | mr vanderbilt found that the railroad and its management were fiercely assailed in the press in the legislature and in municipal councils | he became convinced that no matter how wise or just or fair the railroad might be in the interests of every community and every business which were so dependent upon its transportation the public would not submit to any great line being owned by one man | the vanderbilt promptness in arriving at a decision was immediately shown | he called upon mr pierpont morgan and through him a syndicate which morgan formed took and sold the greater part of mr vanderbilt's new york central stock | the result was that the new york central from that time was owned by the public | it is a tribute to the justice and fairness of the vanderbilt management that though the management has been submitted every year since to a stockholders' vote there has practically never been any opposition to a continuance of the vanderbilt policy and management | among the most important of the many problems during mr vanderbilt's presidency was the question of railway commissions both in national and state governments | in my professional capacity of general counsel and in common with representatives of other railroads i delivered argumentative addresses against them | the discussions converted me and i became convinced of their necessity | the rapidly growing importance of railway transportation had created the public opinion that railway management should be under the control and supervision of some public body that all passengers or shippers or those whose land was taken for construction and development should have an appeal from the decision of the railway managers to the government through a government commission | as soon as i was convinced that commissions were necessary for the protection of both the public and the railroads i presented this view to mr vanderbilt | the idea was contrary to his education training and opinion | it seemed to me that it was either a commission or government ownership and that the commission if strengthened as a judicial body would be as much of a protection to the bond and stock holders and the investing public as to the general public and the employees | mr vanderbilt always open minded adopted this view and supported the commission system and favored legislation in its behalf | in 1883 mr vanderbilt decided on account of illness to retire from the presidency and mr james h rutter was elected his successor | mr rutter was the ablest freight manager in the country but his health gave way under the exactions of executive duties and i acted largely for him during his years of service | he died early in 1885 and i was elected president | the war with the west shore had been on for several years with disastrous results to both companies | the ontario and western which had large terminal facilities near jersey city on the west side of the hudson ran for fifty miles along the river before turning into the interior | at its reorganization it had ten millions of cash in the treasury | with this as a basis its directors decided to organize a new railroad to be called the west shore and parallel the new york central through its entire length to buffalo | as the new york central efficiently served this whole territory the only business the west shore could get must be taken away from the central | to attract this business it offered at all stations lower rates | to retain and hold its business the new york central met those rates at all points so that financially the west shore went into the hands of a receiver | the new york central was sustained because of its superior facilities and connections and established roadway and equipment | but all new and necessary construction was abandoned maintenance was neglected and equipment run down under forced reduction of expenses | i had very friendly personal relations with the managers and officers of the west shore and immediately presented to them a plan for the absorption of their line instead of continuing the struggle until absolute exhaustion | mr vanderbilt approved of the plan as did the financial interests represented by mr pierpont morgan | by the reorganization and consolidation of the two companies the new york central began gradually to establish its efficiency and to work on necessary improvements | as evidence of the growth of the railway business of the country the new york central proper has added since the reorganization an enormous amount of increased trackage and has practically rebuilt as a necessary second line the west shore and used fully its very large terminal facilities on the jersey side of the hudson | during his active life mr vanderbilt was very often importuned to buy a new york daily newspaper | he was personally bitterly assailed and his property put in peril by attacks in the press | he always rejected the proposition to buy one |  if he said i owned a newspaper i would have all the others united in attacking me and they would ruin me but by being utterly out of the journalistic field i find that taking the press as a whole i am fairly well treated | i do not believe any great interest dealing with the public can afford to have an organ | colonel scott of the pennsylvania thought otherwise but the result of his experiment demonstrated the accuracy of mr vanderbilt's judgment | scott selected as editor of the new york world one of the most brilliant journalistic writers of his time william h hurlburt | when it became known however that the world belonged to colonel scott hurlburt's genius could not save it | the circulation ran down to a minimum the advertising followed suit and the paper was losing enormously every month | mr joseph pulitzer with the rare insight and foresight which distinguished him saw what could be made of the world with its privileges in the associated press and so he paid scott the amount he had originally invested and took over and made a phenomenal success of this bankrupt and apparently hopeless enterprise | i tried during my presidency to make the new york central popular with the public without impairing its efficiency | the proof of the success of this was that without any effort on my part and against my published wishes the new york delegation in the national republican convention in 1888 with unprecedented unanimity presented me as new york's candidate for president | i retired from the contest because of the intense hostility to railroad men in the western states | those states could not understand how this hostility which they had to railroads and everybody connected with them had disappeared in the great state of new york | during my presidency the labor question was very acute and strikes one after another common | the universal method of meeting the demands of labor at that time was to have a committee of employees or a leader present the grievances to the division superintendent or the superintendent of motive power | these officers were arbitrary and hostile as the demands if acceded to led to an increase of expenses which would make them unpopular with the management | they had a difficult position | the employees often came to the conclusion that the only way for them to compel the attention of the higher officers and directors was to strike | against the judgment of my associates in the railway management i decided to open my doors to any individual or committee of the company | at first i was overwhelmed with petty grievances but when the men understood that their cases would be immediately heard and acted upon they decided among themselves not to bring to me any matters unless they regarded them of vital importance | in this way many of the former irritations which led ultimately to serious results no longer appeared | i had no trouble with labor unions and found their representatives in heart to heart talks very generally reasonable | mr arthur chief of the brotherhood of locomotive engineers had many of the qualities of a statesman | he built up his organization to be the strongest of its kind among the labor unions | i enjoyed his confidence and friendship for many years | there never was but one strike on the new york central during my administration and that one occurred while i was absent in europe | its origin and sequel were somewhat dramatic | i had nearly broken down by overwork and the directors advised me to take an absolute rest and a trip abroad | i sent word over the line that i wanted everything settled before leaving and to go without care | a large committee appeared in my office a few mornings after | to my surprise there was a representative from every branch of the service passenger and freight conductors brakemen shopmen yardmen switchmen and so forth | these had always come through their local unions | i rapidly took up and adjusted what each one of the representatives of his order claimed and then a man said: i represent the locomotive engineers | my response was: you have no business here and i will have nothing to do with you | i will see no one of the locomotive engineers except their accredited chief officer |  well he said mr president there is a new condition on the road a new order of labor called the knights of labor | we are going to absorb all the other unions and have only one | the only obstacle in the way is the locomotive engineers who refuse to give up their brotherhood and come in with us but if you will recognize us only that will force them to join | now the brotherhood intends to present a demand very soon and if you will recognize our order the knights of labor and not the brotherhood of locomotive engineers we will take care of what they demand and all others from every department for two years and you can take your trip to europe in perfect peace of mind | if you do not do this there will be trouble | i declined to deal with them as representatives of the brotherhood of locomotive engineers | then their spokesman said: as this is so serious to you we will give you to night to think it over and come back in the morning | i immediately sent for the superintendent of motive power and directed him to have posted by telegraph in every roundhouse that the request of the brotherhood of locomotive engineers of which this committee had told me had been granted | the next morning the committee returned and their leader said: well mr president you have beaten us and we are going home | then i appealed to them saying: i am a pretty badly broken up man | the doctors tell me that if i can have three months without care i will be as good as ever | you must admit that i have at all times been absolutely square with you and tried to adjust fairly the matters you have brought to me | now will you take care of me while i am absent | they answered unanimously: mr president we will and you can be confident there will be no trouble on the new york central while you are away | i sailed with my mind free from anxiety hopeful and happy leaving word to send me no cables or letters | after a visit to the passion play at ober ammergau in upper bavaria i went into the austrian tyrol | one night at a hotel in innsbruck mr graves a very enterprising reporter of a new york paper suddenly burst into my room and said: i have been chasing you all over europe for an interview on the strike on the new york central | this was my first information of the strike | as soon as i had left new york and was on the ocean the young and ambitious officers who were at the head of the operations of the railroad and disapproved of my method of dealing with the employees discharged every member of the committee who had called upon me | of course this was immediately followed by a sympathetic outburst in their behalf and the sympathizers were also discharged | then the whole road was tied up by a universal strike | after millions had been lost in revenue by the railroad and in wages by the men the strike was settled as usual by a compromise but it gave to the knights of labor the control except as to the brotherhood of locomotive engineers | the early settlement of the strike was largely due to the loyalty and courage of the brotherhood | during my presidency i was much criticised by the public but never by the directors of the company because of my activities in politics and on the platform | for some time when the duties of my office became most onerous and i was in the habit of working all day and far into the night i discovered that this concentrated attention to my railroad problems and intense and continuous application to their solution was not only impairing my efficiency but my health | as i was not a sport and never had time for games or horses i decided to try a theory which was that one's daily duties occupied certain cells of the brain while the others remained idle that the active cells became tired by overwork while others lost their power in a measure by idleness that if after a reasonable use of the working cells you would engage in some other intellectual occupation it would furnish as much relief or recreation as outdoor exercise of any kind | i had a natural facility for quick and easy preparation for public speaking and so adopted that as my recreation | the result proved entirely successful | after a hard day's work on coming home late in the afternoon i accustomed myself to take a short nap of about fifteen minutes | then i would look over my tablets to see if any engagement was on to speak in the evening and if so the preparation of the speech might be easy or if difficult cause me to be late at dinner | these speeches were made several times a week and mainly at banquets on closing of the sessions of conventions of trade organizations of the country | the reciprocal favors and friendship of these delegates transferred to the new york central a large amount of competitive business | while i was active in politics i issued strict orders that every employee should have the same liberty and that any attempt on the part of their superior officers to influence or direct the political action of a subordinate would be cause for dismissal | this became so well known that the following incident which was not uncommon will show the result | as i was taking the train the morning after having made a political speech at utica the yardmaster an irishman greeted me very cordially and then said: we were all up to hear ye last night boss but this year we are agin ye | the position which this activity gave me in my own party and the fact that unlike most employers i protected the employees in their liberty and political action gave me immense help in protecting the company from raids and raiders | we had a restaurant in the station at utica which had deteriorated | the situation was called to my attention in order to have the evils corrected by the receipt of the following letter from an indignant passenger: dear mr president: you are the finest after dinner speaker in the world | i would give a great deal to hear the speech you would make after you had dined in the restaurant in your station at utica | after thirteen years of service as president i was elected chairman of the board of directors | mr samuel r callaway succeeded me as president and on his resignation was succeeded by mr william h newman and upon his resignation mr w c brown became president | following mr brown mr alfred h smith was elected and is still in office | all these officers were able and did excellent service but i want to pay special tribute to mr smith | mr smith is one of the ablest operating officers of his time | when the united states government took over the railroads he was made regional director of the government for railroads in this territory | he received the highest commendation from the government and from the owners of the railroads for the admirable way in which he had maintained them and their efficiency during the government control | on the surrender of the railroads by the government mr smith was welcomed back by his directors to the presidency of the new york central | the splendid condition of the central and its allied lines is largely due to him | during his service as regional director the difficult task of the presidency of the new york central was very ably performed by mr william k vanderbilt jr | though the youngest among the executive officers of the railroads of the country he was at the same time one of the best | among the efficient officers who have served the new york central during the time i have been with the company i remember many on account of their worth and individuality | h walter webb came into the railway service from an active business career | with rare intelligence and industry he rapidly rose in the organization and was a very capable and efficient officer | there was theo | voorhees the general superintendent an unusually young man for such a responsible position | he was a graduate of troy polytechnical school and a very able operating officer | having gone directly from the college to a responsible position he naturally did not understand or know how to handle men until after long experience | he showed that want of experience in a very drastic way in the strike of 1892 and its settlement | being very arbitrary he had his own standards | for instance i was appealed to by many old brakemen and conductors whom he had discharged | i mention one particularly who had been on the road for twenty five years | voorhees's answer to me was: these old employees are devoted to toucey my predecessor and for efficient work i must have loyalty to me | i reversed his order and told him i would begin to discharge if necessary the latest appointments including himself keeping the older men in the service who had proved their loyalty to the company by the performance of their duties | mr voorhees became afterwards vice president and then president of the philadelphia and reading | with experience added to his splendid equipment and unusual ability he became one of the best executives in the country | mr john m toucey who had come up from the bottom to be general superintendent and general manager was a hard student | his close contact with his fellow employees gave him wonderful control over men | he supplemented his practical experience by hard study and was very well educated | though self taught he had no confidence in the graduates of the professional schools | in selecting an assistant one of them told me that toucey subjected him to a rigid examination and then said: what is your railroad career |  i began at the bottom answered the assistant and have filled every office on my old road up to division superintendent which i have held for so many years |  that is very fine said toucey but are you a graduate of the troy technical school |  no sir |  of the stevens tech |  no sir |  of massachusetts tech |  no sir |  then you are engaged said toucey | mr toucey was well up to date and differed from a superintendent on another road in which i was a director | the suburban business of that line had increased very rapidly but there were not enough trains or cars to accommodate the passengers | the overcrowding caused many serious discomforts | i had the superintendent called before the board of directors and said to him: why don't you immediately put on more trains and cars |  why mr depew he answered what would be the use | they are settling so fast along the line that the people would fill them up and overcrowd them just as before | i was going over the line on an important tour at one time with g h burroughs superintendent of the western division | we were on his pony engine with seats at the front alongside the boiler so that we could look directly on the track | burroughs sat on one side and i on the other | he kept on commenting aloud by way of dictating to his stenographer who sat behind him and praise and criticism followed rapidly | i heard him utter in his monotonous way: switch misplaced we will all be in hell in a minute and then a second afterwards continue: we jumped the switch and are on the track again | discharge that switchman | major zenas priest was for fifty years a division superintendent | it was a delightful experience to go with him over his division | he knew everybody along the line was general confidant in their family troubles and arbiter in neighborhood disputes | he knew personally every employee and his characteristics and domestic situation | the wives were generally helping him to keep their husbands from making trouble | to show his control and efficiency he was always predicting labor troubles and demonstrating that the reason they did not occur was because of the way in which he handled the situation | mr c m bissell was a very efficient superintendent and for a long time in charge of the harlem railroad | he told me this incident | we decided to put in effect as a check upon the conductors a system by which a conductor when a fare was paid on the train must tear from a book a receipt which he gave to the passenger and mark the amount on the stub from which the receipt was torn | soon after a committee of conductors called upon mr bissell and asked for an increase of pay |  why bissell asked boys why do you ask for that now | after a rather embarrassing pause the oldest conductor said: mr bissell you have been a conductor yourself | this half century and six years during which i have been in the service of the new york central railroad has been a time of unusual pleasure and remarkably free from friction or trouble | in this intimate association with the railroad managers of the united states i have found the choicest friendships and the most enduring | the railroad manager is rarely a large stockholder but he is a most devoted and efficient officer of his company | he gives to its service for the public the employees the investors and the company all that there is in him | in too many instances because these officers do not get relief from their labor by variation of their work they die exhausted before their time | the story graphically told by one of the oldest and ablest of railroad men mr marvin hughitt for a long time president and now chairman of the chicago and northwestern railway illustrates what the railroad does for the country | twenty five years ago the northwestern extended its lines through northern iowa | mr hughitt drove over the proposed extension on a buckboard | the country was sparsely settled because the farmers could not get their products to market and the land was selling at six dollars per acre | in a quarter of a century prosperous villages and cities had grown up along the line and farms were selling at over three hundred dollars per acre | while this enormous profit from six dollars per acre to over three hundred has come to the settlers who held on to their farms because of the possibilities produced by the railroad the people whose capital built the road must remain satisfied with a moderate return by way of dividend and interest and without any enhancement of their capital but those investors should be protected by the state and the people to whom their capital expenditures have been such an enormous benefit |xix  recollections from abroad i know of nothing more delightful for a well read american than to visit the scenes in great britain with which he has become familiar in his reading | no matter how rapidly he may travel if he goes over the places made memorable by sir walter scott in the waverley novels and in his poems he will have had impressions thrills and educational results which will be a pleasure for the rest of his life | the same is true of an ardent admirer of dickens or of thackeray in following the footsteps of their heroes and heroines | i gained a liberal education and lived over again the reading and studies of a lifetime in my visits to england ireland scotland and wales | i also had much the same experience of vivifying and spiritualizing my library in france italy germany belgium and holland | london is always most hospitable and socially the most delightful of cities | while mr gladstone was prime minister and more in the eyes of the world than any statesman of any country a dinner was given to him with the special object of having me meet him | the ladies and gentlemen at the dinner were all people of note | among them were two american bishops | the arrangement made by the host and hostess was that when the ladies left the dining room i should take the place made vacant alongside mr gladstone but one of the american bishops who in his younger days was a famous athlete made a flying leap for that chair and no sooner landed than he at once proposed to mr gladstone this startling question: as the bishop of the old catholic church in germany does not recognize the authority of the pope how can he receive absolution |  and some other abstruse theological questions | this at once aroused mr gladstone who when once started was stopped with difficulty and there was no pause until the host announced that the gentlemen should join the ladies | i made it a point at the next dinner given for me to meet mr gladstone that there should be no american bishops present | at another time upon arriving at my hotel in london from new york i found a note from lord rosebery saying that mr gladstone was dining with lady rosebery and himself that evening and there would be no other guests and inviting me to come | i arrived early and found mr gladstone already there | while the custom in london society then was for the guests to be late mr gladstone was always from fifteen minutes to half an hour in advance of the time set by his invitation | he greeted me with great cordiality and at once what were known as the gladstone tentacles were fastened on me for information | it was a peculiarity with the grand old man that he extracted from a stranger practically all the man knew and the information was immediately assimilated in his wonderful mind | he became undoubtedly the best informed man on more subjects than anybody in the world | mr gladstone said to me: it has been raining here for forty days | what is the average rainfall in the united states and in new york | if there was any subject about which i knew less than another it was the meteorological conditions in america | he then continued with great glee: our friend lord rosebery has everything and knows everything so it is almost impossible to find for him something new | great books are common but i have succeeded in my explorations among antiquarian shops in discovering the most idiotic book that ever was written | it was by an old lord mayor of london who filled a volume with his experiences in an excursion on the thames which is the daily experience of every englishman | to the disappointment of mr gladstone lord rosebery also had that book | the evening was a memorable one for me | after a most charming time and dinner while lord rosebery went off to meet an engagement to speak at a meeting of colonial representatives lady rosebery took mr gladstone and myself to the opera at covent garden | there was a critical debate on in the house of commons and the whips were running in to inform him of the progress of the battle and to get instructions from the great leader | during the entr'actes mr gladstone most interestingly talked of his sixty years' experience of the opera | he knew all the great operas of that period and criticised with wonderful skill the composers and their characteristics | he gave a word picture of all the great artists who had appeared on the english stage and the merits and demerits of each | a stranger listening to him would have said that a veteran musical critic who had devoted his life to that and nothing else was reminiscing | he said that thirty years before the manager of covent garden had raised the pitch that this had become so difficult that most of the artists to reach it used the tremolo and that the tremolo had taken away from him the exquisite pleasure which he formerly had in listening to an opera | mr gladstone was at that time the unquestionable master of the house of commons and its foremost orator | i unfortunately never heard him at his best but whether the question was of greater or lesser importance the appearance of mr gladstone at once lifted it above ordinary discussion to high debate | mr gladstone asked many questions about large fortunes in the united states was curious about the methods of their accumulation and whether they survived in succeeding generations | he wanted to know all about the reputed richest man among them | i told him i did not know the amount of his wealth but that it was at least one hundred millions of dollars |  how invested | he asked | i answered: all in fluid securities which could be turned into cash in a short time | he became excited at that and said: such a man is dangerous not only to his own country but to the world | with that amount of ready money he could upset the exchanges and paralyze the borrowing power of nations |  but i said you have enormous fortunes and mentioned the duke of westminster |  i know every pound of westminster's wealth he said |  it is in lands which he cannot sell and burdened with settlements of generations and obligations which cannot be avoided |  how about the rothschilds | i asked |  their fortunes he answered are divided among the firms in london paris vienna and frankfort and it would be impossible for them to be combined and used to unsettle the markets of the world | but mr could do this and prevent governments from meeting their obligations | mr gladstone had no hostility to great fortunes however large unless so invested as to be immediately available by a single man for speculation | but fortunes larger than that of one hundred millions have since been acquired and their management is so conservative that they are brakes and safeguards against unreasoning panics | the majority of them have been used for public benefit | the most conspicuous instances are the rockefeller foundation the carnegie endowment and the frick creation | henry labouchere told me a delightful story of mr gladstone's first meeting with robert t lincoln when he arrived in london as american minister | mr lincoln became in a short time after his arrival one of the most popular of the distinguished list of american representatives to great britain | he was especially noted for the charm of his conversation | labouchere said that mr gladstone told him that he was very anxious to meet mr lincoln both because he was the new minister from the united states and because of his great father president lincoln | labouchere arranged for a dinner at his house which was an hour in the country from mr gladstone's city residence | mrs gladstone made mr labouchere promise as a condition for permitting her husband to go that mr gladstone should be back inside of his home at ten o'clock | the dinner had no sooner started than some question arose which not only interested but excited mr gladstone | he at once entered upon an eloquent monologue on the subject | there was no possibility of interruption by any one and mr lincoln had no chance whatever to interpose a remark | when the clock was nearing eleven labouchere interrupted this torrent of talk by saying: mr gladstone it is now eleven it is an hour's ride to london and i promised mrs gladstone to have you back at ten | when they were seated in the carriage labouchere said to mr gladstone: well you have passed an evening with mr lincoln what do you think of him | he replied: mr lincoln is a charming personality but he does not seem to have much conversation | among the very able men whom i met in london was joseph chamberlain | when i first met him he was one of mr gladstone's trusted lieutenants | he was a capital speaker a close and incisive debater and a shrewd politician | when he broke with mr gladstone he retained his hold on his constituency and continued to be a leader in the opposite party | mr chamberlain told me that in a critical debate in the house of commons when the government was in danger mr gladstone who alone could save the situation suddenly disappeared | every known resort of his was searched to find him | mr chamberlain recollecting mr gladstone's interest in a certain subject drove to the house of the lady whose authority on that subject mr gladstone highly respected | he found him submitting to the lady for her criticism and correction some of watts's hymns which he had translated into italian | the british government sent mr chamberlain to america and he had many public receptions given him by our mercantile and other bodies | on account of his separating from mr gladstone on home rule he met with a great deal of hostility here from the irish | i was present at a public dinner where the interruptions and hostile demonstrations were very pronounced | but mr chamberlain won his audience by his skill and fighting qualities | i gave him a dinner at my house and had a number of representative men to meet him | he made the occasion exceedingly interesting by presenting views of domestic conditions in england and international ones with this country which were quite new to us | mr chamberlain was a guest on the teutonic at the famous review of the british navy celebrating queen victoria's jubilee where i had the pleasure of again meeting him | he had recently married miss endicott the charming daughter of our secretary of war and everybody appreciated that it was a british statesman's honeymoon | he gave me a dinner in london at which were present a large company and two subjects came under very acute discussion | there had been a recent marriage in high english society where there were wonderful pedigree and relationships on both sides but no money | it finally developed however that under family settlements the young couple might have fifteen hundred pounds a year or seven thousand five hundred dollars | the decision was unanimous that they could get along very well and maintain their position on this sum and be able to reciprocate reasonably the attentions they would receive | nothing could better illustrate the terrific increase in the cost of living than the contrast between then and now | some one of the guests at the dinner said that the americans by the introduction of slang were ruining the english language | mr james russell lowell had come evidently prepared for this controversy | he said that american slang was the common language of that part of england from which the pilgrims sailed and that it had been preserved in certain parts of the united states notably northern new england | he then produced an old book a sort of dictionary of that period and proved his case | it was a surprise to everybody to know that american slang was really classic english and still spoken in the remoter parts of massachusetts and new hampshire though no longer in use in england | the period of mr gladstone's reign as prime minister was one of the most interesting for an american visitor who had the privilege of knowing him and the eminent men who formed his cabinet | the ladies of the cabinet entertained lavishly and superbly | a great favorite at these social gatherings was miss margot tennant afterwards mrs asquith | her youth her wit her originality and audacity made every function a success which was graced by her presence | the bitterness towards mr gladstone of the opposition party surpassed anything i have met in american politics except during the civil war | at dinners and receptions given me by my friends of the tory party i was supposed as an american to be friendly to mr gladstone and home rule | i do not know whether this was the reason or whether it was usual but on such occasions the denunciation of mr gladstone as a traitor and the hope of living to see him executed was very frequent | i remember one important public man who was largely interested and a good deal of a power in canadian and american railroads | he asked a friend of mine to arrange for me to meet him | i found him a most agreeable man and very accurately informed on the railway situation in canada and the united states | he was preparing for a visit and so wanted me to fill any gaps there might be in his knowledge of the situation | apropos of the political situation at the time he suddenly asked me what was the attitude of the people of the united states towards mr gladstone and his home rule bill | i told him they were practically unanimous in favor of the bill and that mr gladstone was the most popular englishman in the united states | he at once flew into a violent rage the rarest thing in the world for an englishman and lost control of his temper to such a degree that i thought the easiest way to dam the flood of his denunciation was to plead another engagement and retire from the field | i met him frequently afterwards especially when he came to the united states but carefully avoided his pet animosity | one year in the height of the crisis of mr gladstone's effort to pass the home rule bill a member of his cabinet said to me: we of the cabinet are by no means unanimous in believing in mr gladstone's effort but he is the greatest power in our country | the people implicitly believe in him and we are helping all we can | it is well known that one after another broke away from him in time | the same cabinet minister continued: mr gladstone has gone to the extreme limit in concessions made in his home rule bill and he can carry the english scotch and welsh members | but every time the irish seem to be satisfied they make a new demand and a greater one | unless this stops and the present bill is accepted the whole scheme will break down | many of the irish members are supported by contributions from america | their occupation is politics | if home rule should be adopted the serious people of ireland whose economic interests are at stake might come to the front and take all representative offices themselves | we have come to the conclusion that enough of the irish members to defeat the bill do not want home rule on any conditions | i know it is a custom when you arrive home every year that your friends meet you down the bay and give you a reception | plunging into it i swam across and ran down by the side of it a short distance and in order to baffle the dogs swam back to the other side again | i stopped in the reed bed and listened | the dogs seemed close at hand and by the loud barking i felt persuaded that crop's hounds were with them | i thought of the fate of little john who had been torn in pieces by the hounds and of the scarcely less dreadful condition of those who had escaped the dogs only to fall into the hands of the overseer | the yell of the dogs grew louder | escape seemed impossible | i ran down to the creek with a determination to drown myself | i plunged into the water and went down to the bottom but the dreadful strangling sensation compelled me to struggle up to the surface | again i heard the yell of the bloodhounds and again desperately plunged down into the water | as i went down i opened my mouth and choked and gasping i found myself once more struggling upward | as i rose to the top of the water and caught a glimpse of the sunshine and the trees the love of life revived in me | i swam to the other side of the creek and forced my way through the reeds to a large tree and stood under one of its lowest limbs ready in case of necessity to spring up into it | here panting and exhausted i stood waiting for the dogs | the woods seemed full of them | i heard a bell tinkle and a moment after our old hound venus came bounding through the cane dripping wet from the creek | as the old hound came towards me i called to her as i used to do when out hunting with her | she stopped suddenly looked up at me and then came wagging her tail and fawning around me | a moment after the other dog came up hot in the chase and with their noses to the ground | i called to them but they did not look up but came yelling on | i was just about to spring into the tree to avoid them when venus the old hound met them and stopped them | they then all came fawning and playing and jumping about me | the very creatures whom a moment before i had feared would tear me limb from limb were now leaping and licking my hands and rolling on the leaves around me | i listened awhile in the fear of hearing the voices of men following the dogs but there was no sound in the forest save the gurgling of the sluggish waters of the creek and the chirp of black squirrels in the trees | i took courage and started onward once more taking the dogs with me | the bell on the neck of the old dog i feared might betray me and unable to get it off her neck i twisted some of the long moss of the trees around it so as to prevent its ringing | at night i halted once more with the dogs by my side | harassed with fear and tormented with hunger i laid down and tried to sleep | but the dogs were uneasy and would start up and bark at the cries or the footsteps of wild animals and i was obliged to use my utmost exertions to keep them quiet fearing that their barking would draw my pursuers upon me | i slept but little and as soon as daylight started forward again | the next day towards evening i reached a great road which i rejoiced to find was the same which my master and myself had travelled on our way to greene county | i now thought it best to get rid of the dogs and accordingly started them in pursuit of a deer | they went off yelling on the track and i never saw them again | i remembered that my master told me near this place that we were in the creek country and that there were some indian settlements not far distant | in the course of the evening i crossed the road and striking into a path through the woods soon came to a number of indian cabins | i went into one of them and begged for some food | the indian women received me with a great deal of kindness and gave me a good supper of venison corn bread and stewed pumpkin | i remained with them till the evening of the next day when i started afresh on my journey | i kept on the road leading to georgia | in the latter part of the night i entered into a long low bottom heavily timbered sometimes called wolf valley | it was a dreary and frightful place | as i walked on i heard on all sides the howling of the wolves and the quick patter of their feet on the leaves and sticks as they ran through the woods | at daylight i laid down but had scarcely closed my eyes when i was roused up by the wolves snarling and howling around me | i started on my feet and saw several of them running by me | i did not again close my eyes during the whole day | in the afternoon a bear with her two cubs came to a large chestnut tree near where i lay | she crept up the tree went out on one of the limbs and broke off several twigs in trying to shake down the nuts | they were not ripe enough to fall and after several vain attempts to procure some of them she crawled down the tree again and went off with her young | the day was long and tedious | as soon as it was dark i once more resumed my journey | but fatigue and the want of food and sleep rendered me almost incapable of further effort | it was not long before i fell asleep while walking and wandered out of the road | i was awakened by a bunch of moss which hung down from the limb of a tree and met my face | i looked up and saw as i thought a large man standing just before me | my first idea was that some one had struck me over the face and that i had been at last overtaken by huckstep | rubbing my eyes once more i saw the figure before me sink down upon its hands and knees | another glance assured me that it was a bear and not a man | he passed across the road and disappeared | this adventure kept me awake for the remainder of the night | towards morning i passed by a plantation on which was a fine growth of peach trees full of ripe fruit | i took as many of them as i could conveniently carry in my hands and pockets and retiring a little distance into the woods laid down and slept till evening when i again went forward | sleeping thus by day and travelling by night in a direction towards the north star i entered georgia | as i only travelled in the night time i was unable to recognize rivers and places which i had seen before until i reached columbus where i recollected i had been with my master | from this place i took the road leading to washington and passed directly through that village | on leaving the village i found myself contrary to my expectation in an open country with no woods in view | i walked on until day broke in the east | at a considerable distance ahead i saw a group of trees and hurried on towards it | large and beautiful plantations were on each side of me from which i could hear dogs bark and the driver's horn sounding | on reaching the trees i found that they afforded but a poor place of concealment | on either hand through its openings i could see the men turning out to the cotton fields | i found a place to lie down between two oak stumps around which the new shoots had sprung up thickly forming a comparatively close shelter | after eating some peaches which since leaving the indian settlement had constituted my sole food i fell asleep | i was waked by the barking of a dog | raising my head and looking through the bushes i found that the dog was barking at a black squirrel who was chattering on a limb almost directly above me | a moment after i heard a voice speaking to the dog and soon saw a man with a gun in his hand stealing through the wood | he passed close to the stumps where i lay trembling with terror lest he should discover me | he kept his eye however upon the tree and raising his gun fired | the squirrel dropped dead close by my side | i saw that any further attempt at concealment would be in vain and sprang upon my feet | the man started forward on seeing me struck at me with his gun and beat my hat off | i leaped into the road and he followed after swearing he would shoot me if i didn't stop | knowing that his gun was not loaded i paid no attention to him but ran across the road into a cotton field where there was a great gang of slaves working | the man with the gun followed and called to the two colored drivers who were on horseback to ride after me and stop me | i saw a large piece of woodland at some distance ahead and directed my course towards it | just as i reached it i looked back and saw my pursuer far behind me and found to my great joy that the two drivers had not followed me | i got behind a tree and soon heard the man enter the woods and pass me | after all had been still for more than an hour i crept into a low place in the depth of the woods and laid down amidst a bed of reeds where i again fell asleep | towards evening on awaking i found the sky beginning to be cloudy and before night set in it was completely overcast | having lost my hat i tied an old handkerchief over my head and prepared to resume my journey | it was foggy and very dark and involved as i was in the mazes of the forest i did not know in what direction i was going | i wandered on until i reached a road which i supposed to be the same one which i had left | the next day the weather was still dark and rainy and continued so for several days | during this time i slept only by leaning against the body of a tree as the ground was soaked with rain | on the fifth night after my adventure near washington the clouds broke away and the clear moonlight and the stars shone down upon me | i looked up to see the north star which i supposed still before me | but i sought it in vain in all that quarter of the heavens | a dreadful thought came over me that i had been travelling out of my way | i turned round and saw the north star which had been shining directly upon my back | i then knew that i had been travelling away from freedom and towards the place of my captivity ever since i left the woods into which i had been pursued on the 21st five days before | oh the keen and bitter agony of that moment | i sat down on the decaying trunk of a fallen tree and wept like a child | exhausted in mind and body nature came at last to my relief and i fell asleep upon the log | when i awoke it was still dark | i rose and nerved myself for another effort for freedom | taking the north star for my guide i turned upon my track and left once more the dreaded frontiers of alabama behind me | the next night after crossing the one on which i travelled and which seemed to lead more directly towards the north | i took this road and the next night after i came to a large village | passing through the main street i saw a large hotel which i at once recollected | i was in augusta and this was the hotel at which my master had spent several days when i was with him on one of his southern visits | i heard the guards patrolling the town cry the hour of twelve and fearful of being taken up i turned out of the main street and got upon the road leading to petersburg | on reaching the latter place i swam over the savannah river into south carolina and from thence passed into north carolina | hitherto i had lived mainly upon peaches which were plenty on almost all the plantations in alabama and georgia but the season was now too far advanced for them and i was obliged to resort to apples | these i obtained without much difficulty until within two or three days journey of the virginia line | at this time i had had nothing to eat but two or three small and sour apples for twenty four hours and i waited impatiently for night in the hope of obtaining fruit from the orchards along the road | i passed by several plantations but found no apples | after midnight i passed near a large house with fruit trees around it | i searched under and climbed up and shook several of them to no purpose | at last i found a tree on which there were a few apples | on shaking it half a dozen fell | i got down and went groping and feeling about for them in the grass but could find only two the rest were devoured by several hogs who were there on the same errand with myself | i pursued my way until day was about breaking when i passed another house | the feeling of extreme hunger was here so intense that it required all the resolution i was master of to keep myself from going up to the house and breaking into it in search of food | but the thought of being again made a slave and of suffering the horrible punishment of a runaway restrained me | i lay in the worlds all that day without food | the next evening i soon found a large pile of excellent apples from which i supplied myself | the next evening i reached halifax court house and i then knew that i was near virginia | on the 7th of october i came to the roanoke and crossed it in the midst of a violent storm of rain and thunder | the current ran so furiously that i was carried down with it and with great difficulty and in a state of complete exhaustion reached the opposite shore | at about 2 o'clock on the night of the 15th i approached richmond but not daring to go into the city at that hour on account of the patrols i lay in the woods near manchester until the next evening when i started in the twilight in order to enter before the setting of the watch | i passed over the bridge unmolested although in great fear as my tattered clothes and naked head were well calculated to excite suspicion and being well acquainted with the localities of the city made my way to the house of a friend | i was received with the utmost kindness and welcomed as one risen from the dead | oh how inexpressibly sweet were the tones of human sympathy after the dreadful trials to which i had been subjected the wrongs and outrages which i witnessed and suffered | for between two and three months i had not spoken with a human being and the sound even of my own voice now seemed strange to my ears | during this time save in two or three instances i had tasted of no food except peaches and apples | i was supplied with some dried meat and coffee but the first mouthful occasioned nausea and faintness | i was compelled to take my bed and lay sick for several days | by the assiduous attention and kindness of my friends i was supplied with every thing which was necessary during my sickness | i was detained in richmond nearly a month | as soon as i had sufficiently recovered to be able to proceed on my journey i bade my kind host and his wife an affectionate farewell and set forward once more towards a land of freedom | i longed to visit my wife and children in powhatan county but the dread of being discovered prevented me from attempting it | i had learned from my friends in richmond that they were living and in good health but greatly distressed on my account | my friends had provided me with a fur cap and with as much lean ham cake and biscuit as i could conveniently carry | i proceeded in the same way as before travelling by night and lying close and sleeping by day | about the last of november i reached the shenandoah river | it was very cold ice had already formed along the margin and in swimming the river i was chilled through and my clothes froze about me soon after i had reached the opposite side | i passed into maryland and on the 5th of december stepped across the line which divided the free state of pennsylvania from the land of slavery | i had a few shillings in money which were given me at richmond and after travelling nearly twenty four hours from the time i crossed the line i ventured to call at a tavern and buy a dinner | on reaching carlisle i enquired of the ostler in a stable if he knew of any one who wished to hire a house servant or coachman | he said he did not | some more colored people came in and taking me aside told me that they knew that i was from virginia by my pronunciation of certain words that i was probably a runaway slave but that i need not be alarmed as they were friends and would do all in their power to protect me | i was taken home by one of them and treated with the utmost kindness and at night he took me in a wagon and carried me some distance on my way to harrisburg where he said i should meet with friends | he told me that i had better go directly to philadelphia as there would be less danger of my being discovered and retaken there than in the country and there were a great many persons there who would exert themselves to secure me from the slaveholders | in parting he cautioned me against conversing or stopping with any man on the road unless he wore a plain straight collar on a round coat and said thee and thou | by following his directions i arrived safely in philadelphia having been kindly entertained and assisted on my journey by several benevolent gentlemen and ladies whose compassion for the wayworn and hunted stranger i shall never forget and whose names will always be dear to me | on reaching philadelphia i was visited by a large number of the abolitionists and friends of the colored people who after hearing my story thought it would not be safe for me to remain in any part of the united states | i remained in philadelphia a few days and then a gentleman came on to new york with me i being considered on board the steam boat and in the cars as his servant | i arrived at new york on the 1st of january | the sympathy and kindness which i have every where met with since leaving the slave states has been the more grateful to me because it was in a great measure unexpected | the slaves are always told that if they escape into a free state they will be seized and put in prison until their masters send for them | i had heard huckstep and the other overseers occasionally speak of the abolitionists but i did not know or dream that they were the friends of the slave | oh if the miserable men and women now toiling on the plantations of alabama could know that thousands in the free states are praying and striving for their deliverance how would the glad tidings be whispered from cabin to cabin and how would the slave mother as she watches over her infant bless god on her knees for the hope that this child of her day of sorrow might never realize in stripes and toil and grief unspeakable what it is to be a slave |  this narrative can he had at the depository of the american

greatly excited | he examined the gun and questioned its qualities and possibilities until he was master of every detail | then he turned to one of his officers and gave a quick order that the gun should be immediately investigated and all that were required should be provided for germany | i heard a picturesque story from a member of the court of queen victoria's interest in all public affairs | there was then as there is generally in european relations some talk of war | the queen was staying at her castle at osborne on the isle of wight | he said she drove alone down to the shore one night and sat there a long time looking at this great fleet which was the main protection of her empire and her people | it would be interesting if one could know what were her thoughts her fears and her hopes | the queen was constantly assisting the government in the maintenance of friendly relations with foreign powers by entertaining their representatives at windsor castle | when general grant after he retired from the presidency made his trip around the world the question which disturbed our american minister when general grant arrived in london was how he could be properly received and recognized | of course under our usage he had become a private citizen and was no more entitled to official recognition than any other citizen | this was well known in the diplomatic circles | when the ambassadors and ministers of foreign countries in london were appealed to they unanimously said that as they represented their sovereigns they could not yield precedence to general grant but he must sit at the foot of the table | the prince of wales solved this question with his usual tact and wisdom | under the recognized usage at any entertainment the prince of wales can select some person as his special guest to sit at his right and therefore precede everybody else | the prince made this suggestion to our minister and performed this courteous act at all functions given to general grant | queen victoria supplemented this by extending the same invitation to general and mrs grant to dine and spend the night with her at windsor castle which was extended only to visiting royalty | i remember that the army of the potomac was holding its annual meeting and commemoration at one of our cities when the cable announced that general grant was being entertained by queen victoria at windsor castle | the conventions of diplomacy which requires all communications to pass through the ambassador of one's country to the foreign minister of another country before it can reach the sovereign were not known to these old soldiers so they cabled a warm message to general grant care of queen victoria windsor castle england | one of the most delightful bits of humor in my recollections of journalistic enterprise was an editorial by a mr alden one of the editors of the new york times | mr alden described with great particularity as if giving the details of the occurrence that the messenger boy arrived at windsor castle during the night and rang the front door bell that her majesty called out of the window in quite american style who is there | and the messenger boy shouted cable for general grant | is he staying at this house | i can only give a suggestion of alden's fun which shook the whole country | one of the court officers said to me during the jubilee: royalties are here from every country and among those who have come over is liliuokalani queen of the hawaiian islands | she is as insistent of her royal rights as the emperor of germany | we have consented that she should be a guest at a dinner of our queen and spend the night at windsor castle | we have settled her place among the royalties in the procession through london and offered her the hussars as her guard of honor | she insists however that she shall have the same as the other kings a company of the guards | having recognized her we are obliged to yield | the same officer told me that at the dinner the dusky queen said to queen victoria: your majesty i am a blood relative of yours |  how so | was the queen's astonished answer |  why said liliuokalani my grandfather ate your captain cook | one of the most interesting of the many distinguished men who were either guests on the teutonic or visited us was admiral lord charles beresford | he was a typical sailor of the highest class and very versatile | he made a good speech either social or political and was a delightful companion on all occasions | he had remarkable adventures all over the world and was a word painter of artistic power | he knew america well and was very sympathetic with our ideals | i met him many times in many relations and always with increasing regard and esteem | i was entertained by lord beresford once in the most original way | he had a country place about an hour from london and invited me to come down on a sunday afternoon and meet some friends | it was a delightful garden party on an ideal english summer day | he pressed me to stay for dinner saying: there will be a few friends coming whom i am anxious for you to know | the friends kept coming and after a while lady beresford said to him: we have set all the tables we have and the dining room and the adjoining room can hold | how many have you invited | the admiral answered: i cannot remember but if we delay the dinner until a quarter of nine i am sure they will all be here | when we sat down we numbered over fifty | lord charles's abounding and irresistible hospitality had included everybody whom he had met the day before | the butler came to lord charles shortly after we sat down and said: my lord it is sunday night and the shops are all closed | we can add nothing to what we have in the house and the soup has given out |  well said this admirable strategist commence with those for whom you have no soup with the fish | when the fish gives out start right on with the next course and so to the close of the dinner | in that way everybody will get something | after a while the butler again approached the admiral and said: my lord the champagne is all gone |  well said lord charles start in on cider | it was a merry company and they all caught on to the situation | the result was one of the most hilarious enjoyable and original entertainments of my life | it lasted late and everybody with absolute sincerity declared he or she had had the best time ever | i was asked to meet lord john fisher in a way a rival of lord beresford | both were exceedingly able and brilliant officers and men of achievement but they were absolutely unlike one had all the characteristics of the celt and the other of the saxon | one of the most interesting things in lord fisher's talk especially in view of later developments was his description of the discoveries and annexations to the british empire made by the british navy | in regard to this he said: the british navy had been acquiring positions of strategic importance to the safety and growth of the empire from time immemorial and some fool of a prime minister on a pure matter of sentiment is always giving away to our possible enemies one or the other of these advantageous positions | he referred especially to heligoland the gift of which to germany had taken place not long before | if heligoland fortified like gibraltar had remained in the possession of the british government germany would not have ventured upon the late war | lord fisher exemplified what i have often met with in men who have won eminent distinction in some career whose great desire was to have fame in another and entirely different one | apparently he wished his friends and those he met to believe that he was the best storyteller in the world that he had the largest stock of original anecdotes and told them better than anybody else | i found that he was exceedingly impatient and irritable when any one else started the inevitable that reminds me and he was intolerant with the story the other was trying to tell | but i discovered also that most of his stories though told with great enthusiasm were very familiar or as we americans would say chestnuts | during my summer vacations i spent two weeks or more at homburg the german watering place | it was at that time the most interesting resort on the continent | the prince of wales afterwards king edward vii was always there and his sister the dowager empress of germany had her castle within a few miles | it was said that there was a quorum of both houses of parliament in homburg while the prince was there but his presence also drew representatives from every department of english life the bench and the bar writers of eminence of both sexes distinguished artists and people famous on both the dramatic and the operatic stage | the prince with keen discrimination had these interesting people always about him | there were also social leaders whose entertainments were famous in london who did their best to add to the pleasure of the visit of the prince | i met him frequently and was often his guest at his luncheons and dinners | he fell in at once in the homburg way | the routine of the cure was to be at the springs every morning at seven o'clock to take a glass of water walk half an hour with some agreeable companion and repeat this until three glasses had been consumed | then breakfast and after that the great bathing house at eleven o'clock | the bathing house was a meeting place for everybody | another meeting place was the open air concerts in the afternoon | in the evening came the formal dinners and some entertainment afterwards | both for luncheon and dinner the prince always had quite a large company | he was a host of great charm tact and character | he had a talent of drawing out the best there was in those about his table and especially of making the occasion very agreeable for a stranger | any one at his entertainments always carried away either in the people he met or the things that were said or both permanent recollections | i do not think the prince bothered about domestic questions | he was very observant of the limitations and restrictions which the english government imposes upon royalty | he was however very keen upon his country's foreign relations | in the peace of europe he was an important factor being so closely allied with the imperial houses of germany and russia | there is no doubt that he prevented the german emperor from acquiring a dangerous control over the czar | he was very fixed and determined to maintain and increase friendly relations between the united states and great britain | he succeeded after many varied and long continued efforts in doing away with the prejudices and hostilities of the french towards the english an accomplishment of infinite value to his country in these later years | i was told that the prince required very little sleep that he retired to bed late and was an early riser | i was awakened one night by his equerry calling me up saying the prince was on the terrace of the kursaal and wanted to see me | the lights were all out everybody had gone and he was sitting alone at a table illuminated by a single candle | what he desired was to discuss american affairs and become more familiar with our public men our ideals our policies and especially any causes which could possibly be removed of irritation between his own country and ours | this discussion lasted till daylight | meeting him on the street one day he stopped and asked me to step aside into an opening there was in the hedge | he seemed laboring under considerable excitement and said: why do the people in the united states want to break up the british empire | i knew he referred to the home rule bill for ireland which was then agitating parliament and the country and also the frequent demonstrations in its favor which were occurring in the united states | i said to him: sir i do not believe there is a single american who has any thought of breaking up the british empire | a strange foreboding filled the air and the castilians gathered in little groups and talked | to send the navahu captive to his death at the hands of the tribe was not to their fancy but if a member of a te hua clan must be offered up who could tell what vengeance that clan might not take on the strangers | padre vicente looked over all and listened to much and then talked to the governor: was it not the time to take strong brothers that they share both the evil and the good together |  the gods are certainly not well pleased with us we make offerings and we make prayers and the only good they let come to us has been our brothers of the iron and thunder and the fire sticks said phen tzah |  yes i think it is the time to take brothers of a strong god | this was the word of the governor and it was the strongest word yet given for union | but the governor made it plain that he did not belong to the order holding secret of the sun symbol | the po athun were the people who must decide these spirit things | he thought the hearts of the old men of that order were kind and soft for the strangers but the head of that order was tahn t the po athun ho | this gave pause for thought every man who chose to go contrary to the will of tahn t found himself well nigh helpless in the indian land his infernal gods were so strong that the castilians were none too eager to flout them only yahn tsyn deh seeing the crisis of things crept to juan gonzalvo and whispered you hate the po athun ho and you say love words to me | you think you want me | juan gonzalvo was a blunt soldier who had never before been kept at the distance of tantalus by an indian girl who took his gifts | on her brown neck a silver necklace of his shone richly and in her braided hair corals of the sea gleamed red | while others had fled to the altars for prayers and sprinkled sacred pollen to the go h yahs the mediators between earth and spirit world yahn had bathed in the river and made herself beautiful with castilian gifts and barbaric trinketry | to the man who measured her with eager eyes she looked beautiful as the te hua goddess of whom she had told him ta ah quea who brings the spring | he told her so while he devoured her with his glances | good  she said |  you give me love and you hate the po athun ho | you can have us both if your heart is brave this night | his arms would have clasped her for that promise but she eluded him and laughed |  your don ruy tells you the po athun ho must have no harm she whispered but is there not among your men one maybe even three soldiers who are master of the bow and can destroy in silence | gonzalvo was himself a master bowman and had some pride in knowing it also he could if need be pick men of his company who had skill and could be trusted | blaine's retort to a question delighted every american in the place | one of the guests was the then duke of manchester an old man and a great tory | when the duke grasped that blaine was a leading american and had been a candidate for the presidency of the united states all his old toryism was aroused and he was back in the days of george iii | to the horror of the prince the duke said to mr blaine: the most outrageous thing in all history was your rebellion and separation from the best government on earth | he said much more before the prince could stop him | blaine with that grace and tact for which he was so famous smilingly said: well your grace if george iii had had the sense tact and winning qualities of his great grandson our host it is just possible that we might now be a self governing colony in the british empire | the answer relieved the situation and immensely pleased the host | lord rosebery once said in a speech that with the tremendous growth in every element of greatness of the united states if the american colonies had remained in the british empire with their preponderating influence and prestige the capital of great britain might have been moved to new york and buckingham palace rebuilt in central park | at another dinner one of the guests of the prince suddenly shot at me across the table the startling question: do you know certain american heiresses naming them now visiting london | i answered yes naming one especially a very beautiful and accomplished girl who was quite the most popular debutante of the london season |  how much has she | he asked | i named the millions which she would probably inherit |  but i added before you marry an american heiress you better be sure that she can say the lord's prayer | he said with great indignation that he would be astonished if any american girl could be recognized in english society who had been so badly brought up that she was not familiar with the lord's prayer |  all of them are i replied but few heiresses unless they have come into their inheritance and can say 'our father who art in heaven ' will inherit much because american fathers are very speculative | he continued to express his astonishment at this lack of religious training in an american family while the prince enjoyed the joke so much that i was fearful in his convulsive laughter he would have a fit of apoplexy | once at a dinner given by the prince an old lady of very high rank and leading position said suddenly to me and in a way which aroused the attention of the whole company: is it true that divorces are very common in america | i knew that a denial by me would not convince her or any others who shared in this belief then very common in europe | of course the prince knew better | i saw from his expression that he wished me to take advantage of the opportunity | i made up my mind quickly that the best way to meet this belief was by an exaggeration which would show its absurdity | having once started the imaginative situation grew beyond my anticipation | i answered: yes divorces are so common with us that the government has set aside one of our forty odd states for this special purpose | it is the principal business of the authorities | most of these actions for divorce take place at the capital which is always crowded with great numbers of people from all parts of the country seeking relief from their marital obligations |  did you ever visit that capital | asked the prince |  yes several times i answered but not for divorce | my domestic relations have always been very happy but it is also a famous health resort and i went there for the cure |  tell us about your visit said the prince |  well i continued it was out of season when i was first there so the only amusement or public occasions of interest were prayer meetings | the old lady asked excitedly: share meetings | she had been a large and unfortunate investor in american stocks | i relieved her by saying: no not share meetings but religious prayer meetings | i remember one evening that the gentleman who sat beside me turned suddenly to his wife and said: 'we must get out of here at once the air is too close '| 'why no ' she said 'the windows are all open and the breeze is fresh '| 'yes ' he quickly remarked 'but next to you are your two predecessors from whom i was divorced and that makes the air too close for me ' | the old lady exclaimed: what a frightful condition |  tell us more said the prince |  well i continued one day the mayor of the city invited me to accompany him to the station as the divorce train was about to arrive | i found at the station a judge and one of the court attendants | the attendant had a large package of divorce decrees to which the seal of the court had been attached and also the signature of the judge | they only required to have the name of the party desiring divorce inserted | alongside the judge stood a clergyman of the established church in full robes of his sacred office | when the passengers had all left the cars the conductor jumped on to one of the car platforms and shouted to the crowd: 'all those who desire divorce will go before the judge and make their application '|  when they had all been released by the court the conductor again called out: 'all those who have been accompanied by their partners or where both have been to day released from their former husbands and wives to be remarried will go before the rector '| he married them in a body whereupon they all resumed their places on the train | the blowing of the whistle and the ringing of the bell on the locomotive was the music of their first second or third honeymoon journey | the old lady threw up her hands in horror and cried: such an impious civilization must come speedily not only to spiritual and moral destruction but chaos | most of the company saw what an amazing caricature the whole story was and received it with great hilarity | the effect of it was to end for that circle at least and their friends a serious discussion of the universality of american divorces | the prince was always an eager sportsman and a very chivalric one | at the time of one of the races at cowes he became very indignant at the conduct of an american yachtsman who had entered his boat | it was charged by the other competitors that this american yachtsman violated all the unwritten laws of the contest | after the race the prince said to me: a yacht is a gentleman's home whether it is racing or sailing about for pleasure | the owner of this yacht to make her lighter and give her a better chance removed all the furniture and stripped her bare | he even went so far i am told that when he found the steward had left his stateroom a tooth brush he threw it out of the port window | it will be seen from these few anecdotes how intensely human was the prince of wales | he did much for his country both as prince and king and filled in a wise and able way the functions of his office | certainly no official did quite so much for the peace of europe during his time and no royalty ever did more to make the throne popular with the people | i heard him speak at both formal and informal occasions and his addresses were always tactful and wise | while at homburg we used to enjoy the delightful excursions to nauheim the famous nerve cure place | i met there at one time a peculiar type of americans quite common in former years | they were young men who having inherited fortunes sufficient for their needs had no ambitions | after a strenuous social life at home and in europe they became hypochondriacs and were chasing cures for their imaginary ills from one resort to another | one of them who had reached middle life had of course become in his own opinion a confirmed invalid | i asked him: what brought you here | you look very well |  that is just my trouble he answered |  i look very well and so get no sympathy but my nervous system is so out of order that it only takes a slight shock to completely disarrange it | for instance the cause of my present trouble | i was dining in paris at the house of a famous hostess and a distinguished company was present | the only three americans were two ladies and myself | i was placed between them | you know one of these ladies while a great leader at home uses very emphatic language when she is irritated | the dinner like most french dinners with many courses was unusually long | suddenly this lady leaning over me said to her sister: 'damn it fan will this dinner never end '| the whole table was shocked and my nerves were completely shattered | the great war as i think exterminated this entire tribe | i was delighted to find at nauheim my old friends mark twain and the reverend doctor joseph twichell of hartford conn | doctor twichell was mark twain's pastor at home | he was in college with me at yale and i was also associated with him in the governing corporation of yale university | he was one of the finest wits and remarkable humorists of his time | wit and humor were with him spontaneous and he bubbled over with them | mark twain's faculties in that line were more labored and had to be worked out | doctor twichell often furnished in the rough the jewels which afterwards in mark twain's workshop became perfect gems | i invited them to come over and spend the day and dine with me in the evening at homburg | mark twain at that time had the reputation in england of being the greatest living wit and humorist | it soon spread over homburg that he was in town and was to dine with me in the evening and requests came pouring in to be invited | i kept enlarging my table at the kursaal with these requests until the management said they could go no farther | i placed mark twain alongside lady cork one of the most brilliant women in england | in the course of years of acquaintance i had met mark twain under many conditions | he was very uncertain in a social gathering | sometimes he would be the life of the occasion and make it one to be long remembered but generally he contributed nothing | at this dinner whenever he showed the slightest sign of making a remark there was dead silence but the remark did not come | he had a charming time and so did lady cork but the rest of the company heard nothing from the great humorist and they were greatly disappointed | the next morning mark twain came down to the springs in his tramping suit which had fairly covered the continent | i introduced him to the prince of wales and he was charmed with him in their hour of walk and talk | at dinner that evening the prince said to me: i would have invited mark twain this evening if i thought he had with him any dinner clothes |  at my dinner last night i said he met every conventional requirement |  then continued the prince i would be much obliged if you would get him for dinner with me to morrow evening | it was very much the same company as had dined with the prince the night before | again twain was for a long time a complete disappointment | i knew scores of good things of his and tried my best to start him off but without success | the prince who was unusually adroit and tactful in drawing a distinguished guest out also failed | when the dinner was over however and we had reached the cigars mark twain started in telling a story in his most captivating way | his peculiar drawl his habit in emphasizing the points by shaking his bushy hair made him a dramatic narrator | he never had greater success | even the veteran mark himself was astonished at the uproarious laughter which greeted almost every sentence and was overwhelming when he closed | there are millions of stories in the world and several hundred of them good ones | no one knew more of them than mark twain and yet out of this vast collection he selected the one which i had told the night before to the same company | the laughter and enjoyment were not at the story but because the english had as they thought caught me in retailing to them from mark twain's repertoire one of his stories | it so happened that it was a story which i had heard as happening upon our railroad in one of my tours of inspection | i had told it in a speech and it had been generally copied in the american newspapers | mark twain's reputation as the greatest living humorist caused that crowd to doubt the originality of my stories | mark had declined the cigars but the prince was so delighted that he offered him one of the highly prized selection from his own case | this drew from him a story which i have not seen in any of his books | i have read mark twain always with the greatest pleasure | his books of travel have been to me a source of endless interest and his personal recollections of joan of arc is the best representation of the saint and heroine that i know | when the prince offered him the cigar mark said: no prince i never smoke | i have the reputation in hartford conn of furnishing at my entertainments the worst of cigars | when i was going abroad and as i would be away for several years i gave a reception and invited all my friends | i had the governor of the state of connecticut and the judges of the highest courts and the most distinguished members of the legislature | i had the leading clergymen and other citizens and also the president and faculty of yale university and trinity college |  at three o'clock in the afternoon my butler who is a colored man pompey by name came to me and said: 'mr | clemens we have no cigars '| just then a pedler's wagon stopped at the gate | in england they call them cheap jacks | i hailed the merchant and said: 'what have you in your wagon '| 'well ' he answered 'i have some gobelin tapestries sevres china and japanese cloisonne vases and a few old masters '| then i said to him: 'i do not want any of those but have you cigars and how much '| the pedler answered: 'yes sir i have some excellent cigars which i will sell you at seventeen cents a barrel '| i have to explain that a cent is an english farthing | then i told him to roll a barrel in |  it was a great occasion one of the greatest we ever had in the old state of connecticut continued mark but i noticed that the guests left unusually early after supper | the next morning i asked the butler why they left so early | 'well ' he said 'mr | clemens everybody enjoyed the supper and they were all having a good time until i gave them the cigars | after the gentleman had taken three puffs he said: pomp you infernal nigger get me my hat and coat quick | when i went out my stone walk which was one hundred yards long from the front door to the gate was just paved with those cigars ' | this specimen of american exaggeration told in mark twain's original way made a great hit | i met mark twain at a theatrical supper in london given by sir henry irving | it was just after his publishing firm had failed so disastrously | it was a notable company of men of letters playwrights and artists | poor mark was broken in health and spirits | he tried to make a speech and a humorous one but it saddened the whole company | i met him again after he had made the money on his remarkable lecture tour around the world with which he met and paid all his debts | it was an achievement worthy of the famous effort of sir walter scott | jubilant triumphant and free mark twain that night was the hero never forgotten by any one privileged to be present | one year after strenuous work and unusual difficulties which however had been successfully met i was completely exhausted | i was advised to take a short trip to europe and as usual the four weeks' change of air and occupation was a complete cure | i decided to include rome in my itinerary though i felt that my visit would be something like the experience of phineas fogg who did the whole of europe and saw all there was of it in ten days | when i arrived in the eternal city my itinerary gave me four days there | i wanted to see everything and also to meet if possible one of the greatest of popes leo xiii | i was armed only with a letter from my accomplished and distinguished friend archbishop corrigan | i secured the best known guide who informed me that my efforts to see the sights within my limited time would be impossible | nevertheless the incentive of an extra large commission dependent upon distances covered and sights seen led to my going through the streets behind the best team of horses in rome and pursued by policemen and dogs and the horses urged on by a driver frantic for reward and a guide who professionally and financially was doing the stunt of his life | it was astounding how much ground was really covered in the city of antiquities and art by this devotion to speed and under competent guidance | when i asked to see the pope i was informed that his health was not good and audiences had been suspended | i wrote a letter to the cardinal secretary enclosing archbishop corrigan's letter and stated my anxiety to meet his holiness and the limited time i had | a few hours afterwards i received a letter from the cardinal stating that the holy father appreciated the circumstances and would be very glad to welcome me in private audience at eleven o'clock the next morning | when i arrived at the vatican i was received as a distinguished visitor | the papal guards were turned out and i was finally ushered into the room of cardinal merry del val | he was a young man then and an accomplished diplomat and most intimately informed on all questions of current interest | literature music drama political conditions in europe were among his accomplishments | he said the usual formula when a stranger is presented to the pope is for the guest to kneel and kiss his ring | the pope has decided that all this will be omitted in your case | he will receive you exactly as an eminent foreigner calling by appointment upon the president of the united states | when i was ushered into the presence of the pope he left his throne came forward grasped me cordially by the hand and welcomed me in a very charming way | he was not a well man and his bloodless countenance was as white and pallid as his robes | this was all relieved however by the brilliancy of his wonderful eyes | after a few preliminary remarks he plunged into the questions in which he was deeply interested | he feared the spread of communism and vividly described its efforts to destroy the church ruin religion extirpate faith and predicted that if successful it would destroy civilization | i told him that i was deeply interested in the encyclical he had recently issued to reconcile or make more harmonious the relations between capital and labor | he commenced speaking upon that subject and in a few minutes i saw that i was to be privileged to hear an address from one who as priest and bishop had been one of the most eloquent orators of the age | in his excitement he leaned forward grasping the arms of the throne the color returned to his cheeks his eyes flashed his voice was vibrant and i was the audience the entranced audience of the best speech i ever heard upon the question of labor and capital | i was fearful on account of his health that the exertion might be too great and so arose to leave | he again said to me and taking my hand: i know all about you and am very grateful to you that in your official capacity as president of the new york central railroad you are treating so fairly the catholics | i know that among your employees twenty eight thousand are of the catholic faith and not one of them has ever known any discrimination because of their belief but all of them have equal opportunities with the others for the rewards of their profession and protection in their employment | the next day he sent a special messenger for a renewal of the conversation but unhappily i had left rome the night before | during my stay in rome of four days i had visited most of its antiquities its famous churches and spent several hours in the vatican gallery | our american minister one of the most accomplished of our diplomats mr william potter had also given me a dinner where i was privileged to meet many celebrities of the time | among english statesmen i found in lord salisbury an impressive figure | in a long conversation i had with him at the foreign office he talked with great freedom on the relations between the united states and great britain | he was exceedingly anxious that friendly conditions should continue and became most cordial | the frequent disposition on the part of american politicians to issue a challenge or create eruptions disturbed him | i think he was in doubt when president cleveland made his peremptory demands on the venezuela boundary question if the president recognized their serious importance both for the present and the future | he however reluctantly yielded to the arbitration won a complete victory and was satisfied that such irritating questions were mainly political and for election purposes and had better be met in a conciliatory spirit | i remember a garden party at hatfield house the historical home of the cecils given in honor of king victor emmanuel iii who had recently come to the throne | lord salisbury was of gigantic proportions physically while the king was undersized | the contrast between the two was very striking especially when they were in animated conversation the giant prime minister talking down to his majesty and he with animated gestures talking up to the premier | it is not too great a stretch of imagination when one knows how traditional interviews and conversations between european rulers affect their relations present and future to find in that entertainment and conference that the seed there was sown for the entrance of italy at one of the crises of the great war on the side of the allies and against germany to whom she was bound by the triple alliance | mr gladstone said to me at one time: i have recently met a most interesting countryman of yours | he is one of the best informed and able men of any country whom i have had the pleasure of talking with for a long time and he is in london now | i wish you would tell me all about him | mr gladstone could not recall his name | as there were a number of american congressmen in london i asked: was he a congressman |  no he answered he had a more important office | i then remembered that dewitt clinton when a united states senator resigned to become mayor of the city of new york | on that inspiration i asked: mayor of the city of new york |  yes that is it mr gladstone answered | i then told him that it was abram s hewitt and gave him a description of mr hewitt's career | mr gladstone was most enthusiastic about him | it was my fortune to know mr hewitt very well for many years | he richly merited mr gladstone's encomium | he was one of the most versatile and able americans in public or private life during his time | his father was an english tenant farmer who moved with his family to the united states | mr hewitt received a liberal education and became a great success both in business and public life | he was much more than a business man mayor of new york or a congressman he was public spirited and a wise reformer | mr hewitt told me two interesting incidents in his career | when he visited england he was received with many and flattering attentions | among his invitations was a week end to the home of the nobleman upon whose estates his father had been a tenant farmer | when mr hewitt told the nobleman who was entertaining him as a distinguished american about his father's former relations as one of his tenants the nobleman said: your father made a great mistake in giving up his farm and emigrating to the united states | he should have remained here | mr hewitt said: but my lord so far as i am concerned i do not think so | why  asked his lordship |  because answered mr hewitt then i could never have been a guest on equal terms in your house | mr hewitt was one of the foremost iron founders and steel manufacturers of the country | at the time of our civil war our government was very short of guns and we were unable to manufacture them because we did not know the secret of gun metal | the government sent mr hewitt abroad to purchase guns | the english gunmakers at once saw the trouble he was in and took advantage of it | they demanded prices several times greater than they were asking from other customers and refused to give him any information about the manufacture of gun metal | after he had made the contract with all its exorbitant conditions he went to his hotel and invited the foreman of each department of the factory to meet him | they all came | mr hewitt explained to them his mission and found that they were sympathetic with mr lincoln and his administration and the union cause | then he told them of the trouble he had had with their employers and the hard terms which they had imposed | he asked them then all about the manufacture of gun metal | each one of the foremen was very clear and explicit as to his part and so when they had all spoken mr hewitt with his expert knowledge of the business knew all the secrets of the manufacture of gun metal which he of course gave to the government at washington for use in their several arsenals and shops |  now he said to his guests you have done me a great favor | i will return it | your company is obliged by the contract to deliver this immense order within a limited time | they are going to make an enormous amount of money out of it | you strike and demand what you think is right and you will get it immediately | the gun company made a huge profit but had to share some of it with their workers | it was an early instance of the introduction of profit sharing which has now become common all over the world | one of the most interesting englishmen whom i saw much of both in london and in the united states was sir henry irving | the world of art drama and history owes much to him for his revival of shakespeare | irving was a genius in his profession and in private life perfectly delightful | he gave me a dinner and it was like everything he did original | instead of the usual formal entertainment he had the dinner at one of the old royal castles in the country which had become a very exclusive hotel | he carried us out there in coaches | the company of authors playwrights and men of affairs made the entertainment late and the evening memorable | returning home on the top of the coach the full moon would appear and reappear but was generally under a cloud | irving remarked: i do much better with that old moon in my theatre | i make it shine or obscure it with clouds as the occasion requires | i received a note from him at the time of his last visit to the united states in which he said that a friend from the western part of the country was giving him a dinner at delmonico's to precede his sailing in the early morning on his voyage home | the company was to be large and all good friends and he had the positive assurance that there would be no speaking and wished i would come | the dinner was everything that could be desired | the company was a wonderful one of distinguished representatives of american life | the hours passed along rapidly and joyously as many of these original men contributed story racy adventure or song | suddenly the host arose and said: gentlemen we have with us to night of course that meant an introductory speech about irving and a reply from the guest | irving turned to me and in his deepest and most tragic macbeth voice said: god damn his soul to hell | however he rose to the occasion and an hour or so afterwards when everybody else had spoken not satisfied with his first effort he arose and made a much better and longer speech | he was an admirable after dinner speaker as well as an unusual actor | his wonderful presentations not only of shakespeare's but of other dramas did very much for the stage both in his own country and in ours | those who heard him only in his last year had no conception of him in his prime | in his later years he fell into the fault so common with public speakers and actors of running words together and failing to articulate clearly | i have known a fine speech and a superior sermon and a great part in a play ruined because of the failure to articulate clearly | the audience could not follow the speaker and so lost interest | sir henry told me a delightful story about disraeli | a young relative of irving's took orders and became a clergyman in the established church | at the request of irving disraeli appointed this young man one of the curates at windsor | one day the clergyman came to irving in great distress and said: the unexpected has happened | every one has dropped out and i have been ordered to preach on sunday | irving took him to see disraeli for advice | the prime minister said to the young clergyman: if you preach thirty minutes her majesty will be bored | if you preach fifteen minutes her majesty will be pleased | if you preach ten minutes her majesty will be delighted |  but said the young clergyman my lord what can a preacher possibly say in only ten minutes |  that answered the statesman will be a matter of indifference to her majesty | sir frederick leighton the eminent english artist and at one time president of the royal academy was one of the most charming men of his time | his reminiscences were delightful and told with rare dramatic effect | i remember a vivid description which he gave me of the wedding of one of the british royalties with a german princess | sir frederick was one of the large and distinguished delegation which accompanied the prince | the principality of the bride's father had been shorn of territory power and revenue during the centuries | nevertheless at the time of the wedding he maintained a ministry the same as in the middle ages and a miniature army | palaces built centuries before housed the cabinet | the minister of foreign affairs came to sir frederick and unbosomed himself of his troubles | he said: according to the usual procedure i ought to give a ball in honor of the union of our house with the royal family of england | my palace is large enough but my salary is only eight hundred a year and the expense would eat up the whole of it | sir frederick said: your excellency can overcome the difficulty in an original way | the state band can furnish the music and that will cost nothing | when the time comes for the banquet usher the guests with due ceremony to a repast of beer and pretzels | the minister followed the instructions | the whole party appreciated the situation and the minister was accredited with the most brilliant and successful ball the old capital had known for a century | for several years one of the most interesting men in europe was the duke d'aumale son of louis philippe | he was a statesman and a soldier of ability and a social factor of the first rank | he alone of the french royalty was relieved from the decree of perpetual banishment and permitted to return to france and enjoy his estates | in recognition of this he gave his famous chateau and property at chantilly to the french academy | the gift was valued at ten millions of dollars | in the chateau at chantilly is a wonderful collection of works of art | i remember at one dinner where the duke was the guest of honor those present including the host were mostly new creations in the british peerage | after the conversation had continued for some time upon the fact that a majority of the house of lords had been raised to the peerage during the reign of queen victoria those present began to try and prove that on account of their ancient lineage they were exempt from the rule of parvenu peers | the duke was very tolerant with this discussion and as always the soul of politeness | the host said: your royal highness could you oblige us with a sketch of your ancestry |  oh certainly answered the duke it is very brief | my family the philippes are descendants from aeneas of troy and aeneas was the son of venus | the mushrooms seemed smaller than even the garden variety | the duke was talking to me at one time very interestingly about the visit of his father to america | at the time of the french revolution his father had to flee for his life and came to the united states | he was entertained at mount vernon by washington | he told me that after his father became king of france he would often hesitate or refuse to do something or write something which his ministers desired | the king's answer always was: when i visited that greatest man of all the world general washington at his home i asked him at one time: 'general is it not possible that in your long and wonderful career as a soldier and statesman that you have made mistakes '| the general answered: 'i have never done anything which i cared to recall or said anything which i would not repeat ' and the king would say: 'i cannot do that or sign that because if i do i cannot say for myself what general washington said of himself ' | the duke asked me to spend a week end with him at chantilly and it is one of the regrets of my life that i was unable to accept | i happened to be in london on two successive sundays | on the first i went to westminster abbey to hear canon farrar preach | the sermon was worthy of its wonderful setting | westminster abbey is one of the most inspiring edifices in the world | the orator has to reach a high plane to be worthy of its pulpit | i have heard many dull discourses there because the surroundings refuse to harmonize with mediocrity | the sermon of canon farrar was classic | it could easily have taken a place among the gems of english literature | it seemed to me to meet whatever criticism the eminent dead buried in that old mausoleum might have of these modern utterances | i left the abbey spiritually and mentally elated | the next sunday i went to hear charles spurgeon | it was a wonderful contrast | spurgeon's metropolitan tabernacle was a very plain structure of immense proportions but with admirable acoustics | there was none of the historic enshrining the church which is the glory of westminster abbey no church vestments or ceremonials | mr spurgeon a plain stocky looking man came out on the platform dressed in an ordinary garb of black coat vest and trousers | it was a vast audience of what might be called middle class people | mr spurgeon's sermon was a plain direct and exceedingly forcible appeal to their judgment and emotions | there was no attempt at rhetoric but hard hammerlike blows | as he rose in his indignation and denunciation of some current evils and illustrated his argument with the old testament examples of the punishment of sinners the audience became greatly excited | one of the officers of the church in whose pew i sat groaned aloud and gripped his hands so that the nails left their mark | others around him were in the same frame of mind and spirit | i saw there and then that the men who fought with cromwell and won the battle of naseby had in modern england plenty of descendants | they had changed only in outward deference to modern usages and conditions | if there had been occasion mr spurgeon could have led them for any sacrifice to what they believed to be right | i felt the power of that suppressed feeling i would not say fanaticism but intense conscientiousness which occasionally in elections greatly surprises english politicians | canon farrar's sermon easily takes its place among the selected books of the library | spurgeon's address was straight from the shoulder blow for blow for the needs of the hour | one of the novel incidents of the generous hospitality which i enjoyed every year in london was a dinner at the athenaeum club given to me by one of the members of the government at that time | he was a gentleman of high rank and political importance | there were twenty six at the dinner and it was a representative gathering | at the conclusion our host made a very cordial speech on more intimate relations between the united states and great britain and then in a complimentary phrase introduced me saying: i hope you will speak freely and without limit | i was encouraged by a most sympathetic audience and had a good time during my effort | no one else was called upon | my host was complimentary and said: your speech was so satisfactory that i thought best not to have any more | some time afterwards he said to me: many of my friends had heard of you but never heard you so i made up my mind to give them the opportunity and what was really a purely social affair for every other guest i turned into an international occasion just to draw you out | however the fraud if it was a fraud was an eminent success | no one in england did more for americans than sir henry lucy | every american knew all about him because of his reputation and particularly because he was the author of that most interesting column in punch called the essence of parliament | at his luncheons he gathered eminent men in public life and in the literary and journalistic activities of great britain | these luncheons were most informal and under the hospitable genius of lucy the guests became on intimate terms | there was no table in london where so many racy stories and sometimes valuable historical reminiscences could be heard | to be a guest at one of sir lucy's luncheons was for an american to meet on familiar terms with distinguished men whom he knew all about and was most anxious to see and hear | at a large dinner i had a pleasant encounter with sir henry | in order to meet another engagement he tried to slip quietly out while i was speaking | i caught sight of his retreating figure and called loudly the refrain of the familiar song linger longer lucy | the shout of the crowd brought sir henry back and the other entertainment lost a guest | in several of my visits to london i went to see not only places of interest but also houses and streets made famous in english literature | in one of my many trips to st paul's cathedral i was looking at the tomb of the duke of wellington in the crypt and also at the modest tomb of cruikshank the artist near by | the superintendent asked me who i was and many questions about america and then said: many americans come here but the most remarkable of them all was colonel robert g ingersoll | he was very inquisitive and wanted to know all about wellington's tomb | i told him that the duke's body was first put in a wooden coffin and this was incased in steel that this had made for it a position in a stone weighing twenty tons and over that was a huge stone weighing forty tons | he gave me a slap on the back which sent me flying quite a distance and exclaimed: 'old man you have got him safe | if he ever escapes cable at my expense to robert g ingersoll peoria illinois u s | a ' | i had an opportunity to know that the war by germany against france and england was a surprise to both countries | while in london during part of june 1914 i met cabinet ministers and members of parliament and their whole thought and anxiety were concentrated on the threatened revolution in ireland | the cabinet had asked the king to intervene and he had called representatives of all parties to meet him at buckingham palace | after many consultations he declared settlement or compromise were impossible | the situation was so critical that it absorbed the attention of the government the press and the public | about the first of july i was in paris and found the french worried about their finances and the increase in their military expenses which were reaching threatening figures | the syndicate of french bankers were seriously alarmed | there was no suspicion of german purpose and preparations for attack | while in geneva a few weeks afterwards i became alarmed by letters from relatives in germany who were socially intimate with people holding very important positions in the government and the army and their apprehensions from what their german friends told them and what they saw led to their joining us in switzerland | one day the swiss refused to take foreign money or to make exchange for swiss or to cash letters of credit or bank checks | i immediately concluded that the swiss bankers knew of or suspected germany's hostile intentions and with only two hours and two families with their trunks to pack we managed to reach and secure accommodations on the regular train for paris | there was nothing unusual either at the railroad station or in the city | one of the amusing incidents which are my life preservers occurred at the station | two elderly english spinsters were excitedly discussing the currency trouble | one of them smoothed out a bank of england note and said to her sister: there sarah is a bank of england note which has been good as gold all over the world since christ came to earth and these swiss pigs won't take it | i told this incident afterwards to a banker in london | he said they were very ignorant women there were no bank of england notes at that time | german hostility developed so rapidly that our train was the last which left switzerland for france for nearly two months | we were due in paris at ten o'clock in the evening but did not arrive until the next morning because of the mobilization of french recruits | the excitement in paris was intense | a french statesman said to me: we are doing our best to avoid war | our troops are kept ten kilometres from the frontier but the germans have crossed and seized strategic points | they will hear nothing and accept nothing and are determined to crush us if they can | from all ranks of the people was heard: we will fight to the last man but we are outnumbered and will be destroyed unless england helps | will england help | will england help | i have been through several crises but never witnessed nor felt such a reaction to ecstatic joy as occurred when great britain joined france | the restrictions on leaving paris required time patience and all the resources of our embassy to get us out of france | the helpfulness resourcefulness and untiring efforts of our ambassador myron t herrick won the gratitude of all americans whom the war had interned on the continent and who must get home | there was a remarkable change in england | when we left in july there was almost hysteria over the threatening civil war | in october the people were calm though involved in the greatest war in their history | they did not minimize the magnitude of the struggle or the sacrifices it would require | there was a characteristic grim determination to see the crisis through regardless of cost | cabinet ministers whom i met thought the war would last three years | the constant appeal to me as to other americans was when will you join us | if we fail it is your turn next | it is autocracy and militarism against civilization liberty and representative government for the whole world | we had a perilous and anxious voyage home and found few grasping the situation or working to be prepared for the inevitable except theodore roosevelt and general wood |xx  orators and campaign speakers during my college days at yale wendell phillips william lloyd garrison and henry ward beecher were frequent lecturers and generally on the slavery question | i have heard most of the great orators of the world but none of them produced such an immediate and lasting effect upon their audience as wendell phillips | he was the finest type of a cultured new englander | he was the recipient of the best education possible in his time and with independent means which enabled him to pursue his studies and career | besides he was one of the handsomest men i ever saw upon the platform and in his inspired moments met one's imaginative conception of a greek god | phillips rarely made a gesture or spoke above the conversational but his musical voice reached the remotest comers of the hall | the eager audience fearful of losing a word would bend forward with open mouths as well as attentive ears | it was always a hostile audience at the beginning of mr phillips's address but before the end he swayed them to applause tears or laughter as a skilled performer upon a perfect instrument | his subject was nearly always slavery his views very extreme and for immediate abolition but at that time he had a very small following | nevertheless his speeches especially because of the riots and controversies they caused set people thinking and largely increased the hostility to slavery especially to its extension | i met mr phillips one evening after a lecture at the house of professor goodrich | he was most courtly and considerate to students and invited questions | while i was charmed even captivated by his eloquence i had at that time very little sympathy with his views | i said to him: mr phillips your attack to night upon caleb cushing one of the most eminent and able public men in the country was very vitriolic and most destructive of character and reputation | it seems so foreign to all i know of you that if you will pardon me i would like to know why you did it | he answered: i have found that people as a rule are not interested in principles or their discussions | they are so absorbed in their personal affairs that they do very little thinking upon matters outside their business or vocation | they embody a principle in some public man in whom they have faith and so that man stands for a great body of truth or falsehood and may be exceedingly dangerous because a large following connects the measure with the man and therefore if i can destroy the man who represents a vicious principle i have destroyed the principle | it did not strike me favorably at the time nor does it now | nevertheless in politics and in the battles of politics it represents a dynamic truth | the perfect preparation of a speech was in wendell phillip's view that one in which the mental operations were assisted in no way by outside aid | only two or three times in his life did he prepare with pen and paper an address and he felt that these speeches were the poorest of his efforts | he was constantly studying the art of oratory | in his daily walks or in his library metaphors and similes were suggested which he tucked away in his memory and he even studied action as he watched the muscular movements of men whom he saw in public places | he believed that a perfect speech could be prepared only after intense mental concentration | of course the mind must first be fortified by such reading as provided facts | having thus saturated his mind with information he would frequently lie extended for hours upon his sofa with eyes closed making mental arrangements for the address | in fact he used to write his speeches mentally as victor hugo is said to have written some of his poems | a speech thus prepared phillips thought was always at the command of the speaker | it might vary upon every delivery and could be altered to meet emergencies with the audience but would always be practically the same | this method of preparation explains what has been a mystery to many persons | the several reports of phillips's lecture on the lost arts differ in phraseology and even in arrangement | mr phillips did not read his speeches in print and therefore never revised one | he was firmly of the belief that the printed thought and the spoken thought should be expressed in different form and that the master of one form could not be the master of the other | i met many young men like myself in the canvass of 1856 and also made many acquaintances of great value in after life | it was difficult for the older stump speakers to change the addresses they had been delivering for years so that the young orators with their fresh enthusiasm their intense earnestness and undoubting faith were more popular with the audiences who were keenly alive to the issues raised then by the new republican party | the republican party was composed of whigs and anti slavery democrats | in this first campaign the old timers among the whigs and the democrats could not get over their long antagonism and distrusted each other | the young men whether their ancestry was democratic or whig were the amalgam which rapidly fused all elements so that the party presented a united front in the campaign four years afterwards when mr lincoln was elected | in the course of that campaign i had as fellow speakers many times on the platform statesmen of national reputation | these gentlemen with few exceptions made heavy ponderous and platitudinous speeches | if they ever had possessed humor they were afraid of it | the crowd however would invariably desert the statesman for the speaker who could give them amusement with instruction | the elder statesmen said by way of advice: while the people want to be amused they have no faith in a man or woman with wit or anecdote | when it comes to the election of men to conduct public affairs they invariably prefer serious men | there is no doubt that a reputation for wit has seriously impaired the prospects of many of the ablest men in the country | the only exception to this rule was abraham lincoln | but when he ran for president the first time he was comparatively unknown outside his state of illinois | the campaign managers in their literature put forward only his serious speeches which were very remarkable especially the one he delivered in cooper union new york which deeply impressed the thoughtful men of the east | he could safely tell stories and jokes after he had demonstrated his greatness as president | then the people regarded his story telling as the necessary relief and relaxation of an overburdened and overworked public servant | but before he had demonstrated his genius as an executive they would probably have regarded these same traits as evidences of frivolity unfitting the possessor for great and grave responsibilities | i had a very interesting talk on the subject with general garfield when he was running for president | he very kindly said to me: you have every qualification for success in public life you might get anywhere and to the highest places except for your humor | i know its great value to a speaker before an audience but it is dangerous at the polls | when i began in politics soon after graduation i found i had a keen sense of humor and that made me the most sought after of all our neighborhood speakers but i also soon discovered it was seriously impairing the public opinion of me for responsible positions so i decided to cut it out | it was very difficult but i have succeeded so thoroughly that i can no longer tell a story or appreciate the point of one when it is told to me | had i followed my natural bent i should not now be the candidate of my party for president of the united states | the reason so few men are humorists is that they are very shy of humor | my own observations in studying the lives and works of our public men demonstrate how thoroughly committed to this idea they have been | there is not a joke nor a mot nor a scintilla of humor irradiating the revolutionary statesmen | there is a stilted dignity about their utterances which shows that they were always posing in heroic attitudes | if they lived and moved in family social and club life as we understand it the gloom of their companionship accounts for the enjoyment which their contemporaries took in the three hours' sermons then common from the pulpit | as we leave the period of washington hamilton jefferson and the adamses we find no humor in the next generation | the only relief from the tedium of argument and exhaustless logic is found in the savage sarcasm of john randolph which was neither wit nor humor | a witty illustration or an apt story will accomplish more than columns of argument | the old time audience demanded a speech of not less than two hours' duration and expected three | the audience of to day grows restive after the first hour and is better pleased with forty minutes | it prefers epigrams to arguments and humor to rhetoric | it is still true however that the press presents to readers from a speaker who indulges in humor only the funny part of his effort and he is in serious danger of receiving no credit for ability in the discussion of great questions no matter how conspicuous that ability may be | the question is always presented to a frequent speaker whether he shall win the applause of the audience and lose the flattering opinion of the critics or bore his audience and be complimented by readers for wisdom | when i look back over sixty five years on the platform in public speaking and the success of different methods before audiences political literary business or a legislative committee or a legislature itself and especially when i consider my own pleasure in the efforts the results and compensations have been far greater than the attainment of any office | for after all a man might be dull and a bore to himself and others for a lifetime and have the reputation of being a serious thinker and a solid citizen and yet never reach the presidency | it was always a delight to listen to george w curtis | he was a finished orator of the classic type but not of the demosthenian order | his fine personal appearance his well modulated and far reaching voice and his refined manner at once won the favor of his audience | he was a splendid type of the scholar in politics | in preparing a speech he took as much pains as he did with a volume which he was about to publish | i accepted under great pressure the invitation to deliver the oration at the unveiling of the bartholdi statue of liberty in new york harbor because the time was so short only a few days | mr curtis said to me afterwards: i was very much surprised that you accepted that invitation | i declined it because there was only a month left before the unveiling | i invariably refuse an invitation for an important address unless i can have three months | i take one month to look up authorities and carefully prepare it and then lay it on the shelf for a month | during that period while you are paying no attention to the matter your mind is unconsciously at work upon it | when you resume correcting your manuscript you find that in many things about which you thought well you have changed your mind | leisurely corrections and additions will perfect the address | as my orations and speeches have always been the by product of spare evenings and sundays taken from an intensely active and busy life if i had followed any of these examples my twelve volumes of speeches would never have seen the light of day | one of the greatest orators of his generation and i might say of ours was robert g ingersoll | i was privileged to meet colonel ingersoll many times and on several occasions to be a speaker on the same platform | the zenith of his fame was reached by his plumed knight speech nominating james g blaine for president at the national republican convention in 1876 | it was the testimony of all the delegates that if the vote could have been taken immediately at the conclusion of the speech mr blaine would have been elected | colonel ingersoll carried off the oratorical honors that campaign in a series of speeches covering the whole country | i say a series of speeches he really had but one which was the most effective campaign address i ever heard but which he delivered over and over again and every time with phenomenal success a success the like of which i have never known | he delivered it to an immense audience in new york and swept them off their feet | he repeated this triumph the next day at an open air meeting in wall street and again the next day at a great gathering in new jersey | the newspapers printed the speech in full every day after its delivery as if it had been a new and first utterance of the great orator | i spoke with him several times when he was one of the speakers after an important dinner | it was a rare treat to hear him | the effort apparently was impromptu and that added to its effect upon his auditors | that it was thoroughly prepared i found by hearing it several times always unchanged and always producing the same thrilling effect | he spoke one night at cooper institute at a celebration by the colored people of mr lincoln's proclamation emancipating them from slavery | as usual he was master of the occasion and of his audience | he was then delivering a series of addresses attacking the bible | his mind was full of that subject and apparently he could not help assailing the faith of the negroes by asking if there was a god of justice and mercy why did he leave them so long in slavery or permit them ever to be slaves | to an emotional audience like the one before him it was a most dangerous attack upon faith | i was so fond of the colonel and such an intense admirer of him i hated to controvert him but felt it was necessary to do so | the religious fervor which is so intense with the colored people made it comparatively easy to restore their faith if it had been weakened and to bring them to a recognition of the fact that their blessings had all come from god | probably the most brilliant speaker of the period immediately preceding the civil war was thomas corwin of ohio | we have on the platform in these times no speaker of his type | he had remarkable influence whenever he participated in debate in the house of representatives | on the stump or hustings he would draw audiences away from henry clay or any of the famous speakers of the time | i sometimes wonder if our more experienced and more generally educated audiences of to day would be swayed by corwin's methods | he had to the highest degree every element of effective speech | he could put his audience in tears or hilarious laughter or arouse cheers | he told more stories and told them better than any one else and indulged freely in what is called fourth of july exaggeration | he would relieve a logical presentation which was superb and unanswerable by a rhetorical flight of fancy or by infectious humor | near the close of his life he spoke near new york and his great reputation drew to the meeting the representatives of the metropolitan press | he swept the audience off their feet but the comment of the journals was very critical and unfavorable both of the speech and the orator | it was an illustration of what i have often met with: of a speech which was exactly the right thing for the occasion and crowd but lost its effect in publication | corwin's humor barred his path to great office and he saw many ordinary men advance ahead of him | the most potent factor in the destruction of his enemies and buttressing his own cause was his inimitable wit and humor | in broad statesmanship solid requirements and effective eloquence he stood above the successful mediocrity of his time the buchanans and the polks the franklin pierces and the winfield scotts like a star of the first magnitude above the milky way | but in later years he thought the failure to reach the supreme recognition to which he was entitled was due to his humor having created the impression in the minds of his countrymen that he was not a serious person | wayne macveagh was a very interesting and original speaker | he had a finished and cultured style and a very attractive delivery | he was past master of sarcasm as well as of burning eloquence on patriotic themes | when i was a freshman at yale he was a senior | i heard him very often at our debating society the linonian where he gave promise of his future success | his father in law was simon cameron secretary of war and he was one of the party which went with mr lincoln to gettysburg and heard lincoln's famous address | he told me that it did not produce much impression at the time and it was long after before the country woke up to its surpassing excellence and he did not believe the story still current that mr lincoln wrote it on an envelope while on the train to gettysburg | macveagh became one of the leaders of the american bar and was at one time attorney general of the united states | he was successful as a diplomat as minister to turkey and to italy | i heard him on many occasions and spoke with him on many after dinner platforms | as an after dinner speaker he was always at his best if some one attacked him because he had a very quick temper | he got off on me a witticism which had considerable vogue at the time | when i was elected president of the new york central railroad the yale association of new york gave me a dinner | it was largely attended by distinguished yale graduates from different parts of the country | macveagh was one of the speakers | in the course of his speech he said: i was alarmed when i found that our friend chauncey had been elected president of the most unpopular railroad there is in the country | but rest assured my friends that he will change the situation and before his administration is closed make it the most popular of our railroad corporations because he will bring the stock within the reach of the poorest citizen of the land | the stock was then at the lowest point in its history on account of its life and death fight with the west shore railroad and so of course the reverse of my friend macveagh's prediction was not difficult | one of the greatest and most remarkable orators of his time was henry ward beecher | i never met his equal in readiness and versatility | his vitality was infectious | he was a big healthy vigorous man with the physique of an athlete and his intellectual fire and vigor corresponded with his physical strength | there seemed to be no limit to his ideas anecdotes illustrations and incidents | he had a fervid imagination and wonderful power of assimilation and reproduction and the most observant of eyes | he was drawing material constantly from the forests the flowers the gardens and the domestic animals in the fields and in the house and using them most effectively in his sermons and speeches | an intimate friend of mine a country doctor and great admirer of mr beecher became a subscriber to the weekly paper in which was printed his sunday sermon and carefully guarded a file of them which he made | he not only wanted to read the sermons of his favorite preacher but he believed him to have infinite variety and was constantly examining the efforts of his idol to see if he could not find an illustration anecdote or idea repeated | mr beecher seemed to be teeming with ideas all the time almost to the point of bursting | while most orators are relying upon their libraries and their commonplace book and their friends for material he apparently found more in every twenty four hours than he could use | his sermons every sunday appeared in the press | he lectured frequently several times a week he delivered after dinner speeches and during such intervals as he had he made popular addresses spoke at meetings on municipal and general reform and on patriotic occasions | one of the most effective and for the time one of the most eloquent addresses i ever heard in my life was the one he delivered at the funeral of horace greeley | when the sentiment in england in favor of the the south in our civil war seemed to be growing to a point where great britain might recognize the southern confederacy mr lincoln asked mr beecher to go over and present the union side | those speeches of mr beecher a stranger in a strange country to hostile audiences were probably as extraordinary an evidence of oratorical power as was ever known | he captured audiences he overcame the hostility of persistent disturbers of the meetings and with his ready wit overwhelmed the heckler | at one of the great meetings when the sentiment was rapidly changing from hostility to favor a man arose and asked mr beecher: if you people of the north are so strong and your cause is so good why after all these years of fighting have you not licked the south | mr beecher's instant and most audacious reply was: if the southerners were englishmen we would have licked them | with the english love of fair play the retort was accepted with cheers | while other orators were preparing he seemed to be seeking occasions for talking and drawing from an overflowing reservoir | frequently he would spend an hour with a crowd of admirers just talking to them on any subject which might be uppermost in his mind | i knew an authoress who was always present at these gatherings who took copious notes and reproduced them with great fidelity | there were circles of beecher worshippers in many towns and in many states | this authoress used to come to new haven in my senior year at yale and in a circle of beecher admirers which i was permitted to attend would reproduce these informal talks of mr beecher | he was the most ready orator and with his almost feminine sympathies and emotional nature would add immensely to his formal speech by ideas which would occur to him in the heat of delivery or with comment upon conversations which he had heard on the way to church or meeting | i happened to be on a train with him on an all day journey and he never ceased talking in the most interesting and effective way and pouring out from his rich and inexhaustible stores with remarkable lucidity and eloquence his views upon current topics as well as upon recent literature art and world movements | beecher's famous trial on charges made by theodore tilton against him on relations with tilton's wife engrossed the attention of the world | the charge was a shock to the religious and moral sense of countless millions of people | when the trial was over the public was practically convinced of mr beecher's innocence | the jury however disagreed a few holding out against him | the case was never again brought to trial | the trial lasted six months | one evening when i was in peekskill i went from our old homestead into the crowded part of the village to be with old friends | i saw there a large crowd and also the village military and fire companies | i asked what it was all about and was informed that the whole town was going out to mr beecher's house which was about one and one half miles from the village to join in a demonstration for his vindication | i took step with one of the companies to which i belonged when i was a boy and marched out with the crowd | the president of the village and leading citizens one after another mounted the platform which was the piazza of mr beecher's house and expressed their confidence in him and the confidence of his neighbors the villagers | then mr beecher said to me: you were born in this town and are known all over the country | if you feel like saying something it would travel far | of course i was very glad of the opportunity because i believed in him | in the course of my speech i told a story which had wonderful vogue | i said: mr lincoln told me of an experience he had in his early practice when he was defending a man who had been accused of a vicious assault upon a neighbor |  often the strength of the evil one is a stupendous force for his chosen people agreed don diego |  that is widely known in europe to day when paracelsus with infernal magic of the mind makes cures which belong by every right to the saints alone |  and the people are truly cured of their ills truly healed |  their bodies are truly healed for the life that is temporal but each soul is doomed for the life that is eternal | no christian doubts that the mental magic of the physician is donated by beelzebub whose tool he is |  he was a student of exceeding depth agreed padre vicente and it may be he has found magic forbidden to man | but the greek laid claim to no such power as that however much it is said that the devil loved him | he had only a strong body and the dislike to see it cut to pieces for a heathen holiday |  de soto it is said found a dirk of his when he crossed the land of apalache years later seeking empire | but the tribes could or would tell nothing of the lost greek and the negro slave | the latter was killed by the people called natchez and the greek who had been among many things: a sailor escaped by the water leaving no trail not even the trail made by a white skin in a land of dusk people |  from the turks he had learned a trick of using stain of barks and herbs | his hair was of brown but the eyebrows and lashes were heavy and dark | after using such concoction a mirror of clear water showed him no trace of himself except the eyes they were blue beyond hope but the heavy lashes were a help and a shadow |  with stolen arms of bow hatchet and a flint knife the man went north wading the river edge at night and hiding by day until the land of the natchez was left behind | a strong river came from the west and an old canoe gave him hope of finding new spain by the water course | that journey was a tedious thing of night prowlings hidings and sometimes starvings | then the end of solitude came and he was captured by heathen rangers |  they were a large company and were travelling west | later he learned they were a war company and in a fight his master and most of the others were killed | at the rejoicing of the victors he sang louder and danced more wildly than all the others so they did not kill him | he was traded to other indians further west for a painted robe and some clay pots | this last move brought him to the villages of the stream named later by coronado the rio grande but called by the indians another name the p o s o n g |  the very villages where we are to go | demanded don ruy |  possibly some of the same said the priest |  how many of you remember the great comet of 1528 | several did and all remembered the dread and horror it spread in western europe |  think you then what that same threat in the sky must have been to these wild people who seek magic ever from the stars and even the clouds | it was a threat and it called for some sacrifice propitiating the angry gods | sacrifice  do these infidels then practise such abominations | asked don diego |  to look at the mild eyes and hear their soft voices of these our guests it is not easy to think it agreed padre vicente but these people are but the northern cousins of the men cortez conquered their customs differ only in degree | to both venus and mars were human god offerings made that day of sacrifice is not so long past and in that day it was done here | and   and your lucky greek was the one to be chosen | he was fed well as one would fatten an ox for the knife | he had some knowledge of simple remedies and in brewing herbs for their sick he had also stolen the opportunity for the further addition to his coat of color | he was to them an indian of an unknown tribe yet since he was to be offered to the gods he was made the very center of ceremonial dances and infernal heathenish customs |  both men and women enter into certain sacred or infernal orders whose ceremonies are only known to those initiate | an inter tribal connection is kept up in such societies between villages speaking a totally different language even though the tribes be at war there is always a truce for these wild creatures who dance together for some magic or some prayer to their false gods |  and the truce is kept |  it would not be possible for a tribe to break truce of their diabolical things of their spirits | at the ceremonies for the sacrifice to the comet god was a girl of another tribe and when the greek noted that her desire was not to see him destroyed he had the first glimpse of hope the only other he had was to remove the stain in some way and convince them that their gods had made a miracle to save him | the priest made a gesture towards the great sand drifts at every side of rock wall and column |  to which of you would it occur if hiding meant chance of life to which of you would it occur to go under that sand for days so close to the trail that the women with the water jars would pass you scores of times in a day carrying water from this pool |  this pool this the eyes of don ruy lightened this is then that place of the great danger |  a man could not hide in the sand like that nor deceive these wild trailers of animals decided don diego and of a certainty it could not be close to the trail |  so we would naturally think decided padre vicente |  but the indian girl was wiser than our wisdom se or for she did aid his escape and she did hide him there | to get breath his face was touching a great wall of rock against which another was carelessly laid | the place had been chosen with a knowledge that seemed inspired for only close to the trail where the sand was like to be disturbed by naked romping children only there in all these deserts could he have been hidden from their hunters |  here in this place | again said don ruy |  holy father it is a good story yet sounds a romance fantastic to fit this weird place of the pool and the star shine of the night |  by the name of these people the queres and the name of the village ah ko this should be the place of the sacrificial intentions said the priest |  by the careful account given this is the pool to which the trail led and it may even be that the ancient cacique to whom but now i gave the cigarro was chief priest of the sacrifice in that day |  a truly delectable neighbor for a help to pleasant fancy said don ruy and laughed |  if the amiable devil should be moved to sacrifice now i would be the nearest to his hand think you he would make ill use of my youth and tenderness |  his sanctity the padre was indeed wise that no word of this was breathed in the viceregal ears of mexico said don diego with a testiness not yet subdued over the question of utter damnation for the souls unregenerate |  piety would carry me far but no warrant is mine to follow even the highest where cannibals do wait for unholy sustenance | and he arose and bowed to don ruy |  oh name of the devil | said his noble ward and laughed and stretched his legs |  i may not be so unholy as your words would suggest | give not a dog a bad name in the days of his youth | and at this the scandalized and pious dignitary multiplied words to make clear how far from such meaning were his devoted intentions | but if wild tribes must be fed ere their souls could be reached victims could be found other than the heir of a duchess | at which outburst don ruy suggested that he save his pious breath and devote it to prayers and to take some of his own medicine by remembrance that soul of king and soul of peasant weighed the same before high god |  after which devout exhortation from your servant good father we again give ear to the tale of that devil's disciple the greek teo he said did they find him in the sand | and did the merciful dame hide in the sand also if so the prison might not be without hope | holy saint damien to think that the man walked these same stony heights and drank from that pool |  they never found him in the sand | the priest ignored the other frivolous comment |  they never found him anywhere and a slave from the navahu people was made a sacrifice in his stead | the strange girl was a te hua medicine maid or magic learner of things from the wise men of ah ko | her prayers were very many and very long and she made a shrine for prayer on the sand beside the stone wall where he was hidden | their men set watch on her she knew it but not anything did they find but a girl who made her prayers and gave no heed to their shadowings |  when were ended her days of devotion to the false gods then she ate and drank and took the way to her own people with moderate pace she took that trail north but when night came she ran like the wild thing she was again to the south crept unseen again into this fortress and led the rescued man as far to the west as might be until the dawn came | with the coming of the sun came also a sand storm of great stress and all trace of their steps were covered and the medicine maid saw in that a mystic meaning |  to turk and spaniard the refugee might be only teo the greek a fugitive from all high courts | but to the indian he was a lost god of the great star for whom even the desert winds did duty | when with moistened yucca root he rubbed his hands that the white skin showed she bent her head to the sand and was his slave until the end |  it moves well and beautifully smooth: this tale of the outlaw agreed don ruy but it is that end we are eager for and the how it was compassed that she turned slave or mistress or both in one as alas has chanced to men ere our day was the doom expected from the earliest mention of the pitiful and most devout lady devout to her devils | but of the end the end |  the end came to him long after they parted and for one winter and one summer were their wanderings to the west | of the firebrand river deep between rock walls he had heard and of the ocean far beyond and of mexico to the south | to reach the river they crossed dry leagues of desert and lived as other wild things lived | but the river was not a thing for boats or journeys and they went on beyond it seeking the sea | strange things and strange lives they passed on the way | his skin had been stained many times and his beard was plucked out as it grew | enough of indian words he learned to echo her own tale to the brown savages and the tale was that they were medicine people of te hua in the land of p o s o n g and that they travelled to the shores of the sea for dances and prayers to the gods there | and sometimes food was given them and some times prayers were sent in their keeping | thus was their journey until in the south in the heart of a desert they found the place of the palms where the fruit was ripe and the water comes from warm springs and looks a paradise but is as a hell when the sand storms come: and human devils live to the south and by the sea of cortez |  they knew nothing of that it was a place for rest and a place of food and they rested there because of that and gathered food for the further journey |  all medicine people of the tribes carry on their neck or in a pouch at the belt some sacred things of their magic practices and under the palms when other amusement was not to be found it pleased him to see what his brown girl carried hidden even from her master | it took much persuasions for she felt that evil would happen if it was shown except it be a matter of ceremony | then she at last took from the pouch salt from a sacred lake feather and claw and beak of a yellow bird a blade of sharpest flint and this | he again held the piece of gold that they might see it | even the indians leaned forward and looked at it and then eyed the white men and each other in silence | to them it was medicine as the priest told the adventurers it had been to the te hua girl |  your greek pirate of the good luck went close to madness at the certain fact that for months he had been walking steadily away from the place where this was found | to the girl it was a sacred thing hidden in the earth of her land by the sun and only to be used for ceremonies | the place where it grew was a special hidden place of prayer offering |  faith we all must learn prayers enough to get our share if prayer will do the work | said don ruy chico it means that you get an indian primer and that you find for me a brown enchantress | his reverence will grant us all a special indulgence for hours of the schooling | se or don brancadori sat up very straight and shook his head at the priest: so well assured was he that enough liberties would be taken without the indulgences of holy church | moreover it was not well to put the deviltries of camp in the mind of so good a lad as chico |  and the girl gave to him the gold and told him its hiding place | he asked |  we may say she gave it thought in truth she declared it could not be given it could only be made a barter of for other medicine but it must be strong medicine | the blade of flint was to guard her magic symbols if need be and the man her master saw in that moment that the mind he had to deal with in this matter was an indian mind in which there is not reason | and to find a 'medicine' potent for charms was a task set for a man in the place of the palms |  then a forgotten thing came into his mind | it had been a vow made to an enticing creature of san lucar | she was also devout as a young nun | the vow was of a return and no doubt of other meetings | the end of it was that she gave him a rosary his first captors coveted that and took care of it | but also they ate together of fruit and as both ladies and gallants do strange things at strange times the lady divided the seeds and counted them seeking a lucky number or some such freakish quest | and by the rosary and by his mother she made him swear that when he had found fortune and a plantation in the new world he would plant with his own hands the seeds there and send for the lady to come by ship as chatelaine | failing the plantation he was to return and her own relatives would find on land or sea an office fit for his talents: only he was to faithfully guard the seed of the fruit eaten in a happy hour and her prayers would meet his own across the waters |  it may be that women with prayers for him had not been plentiful whatever the vow was it was made and sealed with the prayer of the lady | when the savages took her rosary they gave no heed to some brown seeds in a leather pouch no more of them than you could count on your fingers | a man alone for long in a wilderness gives meaning to things he would not remember at happier times | and the training of the holy church returns to even the most gardened men in their hours of stress | so it was that the prayer of the willing dame kept him company as he looked on the seeds | they had become his rosary and were the last evidence of the nightly prayers promised by the lady |  thus: because of their smallness had they been unnoted of his several captors | having slipped between the lining and the cover of the pouch he had ceased to remember them after the indian maid lessened his loneliness | but he went searching for them now even one peach seed was still with them and some grains of the bearded wheat that by a special grace had fallen into a pocket on ship board while handling grains and as a jest on himself he had added it to the others for the plantation to be made for the waiting dame |  he could truly say they were 'medicine' given with prayers | but with forgetfulness of truth he also added much as to their divine origin and the wondrous power they held |  gladly the indian girl let go the gold for the unknown seeds | she further signified that now she could know always that he was a god for the gift of the seeds fitted some myth of her own land some thing of one of their false gods who brought seeds and fruits and great good to the people |  in that way was made the exchange of medicine for medicine beside some pool by the palms and well it was it was made that day else never would we have this golden guide | general bruce told me a good campaign story of senator james w nye of nevada | nye was a prominent lawyer of western new york and the most eloquent and witty member of the bar of that section and also the most popular campaign speaker | he moved to nevada and so impressed the people of that young state that he was elected united states senator | in the senate he became a notable figure | nye and general bruce were sent by the national committee to canvass new england | nye had become senatorial in his oratory with much more dignity and elevation of style than before | he began his first speech at bridgeport conn in this way: fellow citizens i have come three thousand miles from my mountain home three thousand feet above the level of the sea to discuss with you these vital questions for the safety of our republic | bruce interrupted him saying: why senator it was only three thousand feet last night | nye turned savagely on bruce: bruce you go to the devil | resuming with the audience he remarked very impressively: as i was saying fellow citizens i have come from my mountain home ten thousand feet above the level of the sea to etc | a story which illustrates and enforces the argument helps a political speech and it is often the only part of the speech which is remembered | i have often heard people say to me: i heard you speak thirty forty or fifty years ago and this is the story you told | sometimes however the story may prove a boomerang in the most unexpected way | for many years when i spoke in northern new york i was always met at the syracuse station by a superintendent of the lackawanna railroad with a special train filled with friends | he carried me up to my destination and brought me back in the morning | it was his great day of the year and during the trip he was full of reminiscences and mainly of the confidences reposed in him by the president of the road my old and valued friend samuel sloan | one fall he failed to appear and there was no special train to meet me | i was told by friends that the reason was his wife had died and he was in mourning | the morning after the meeting i started to call upon him but was informed that he was very hostile and would not see me | i was not going to lose an old friend like that and went up to his office | as soon as i entered he said: go away i don't want to see you again | i appealed to him saying: i cannot lose so good a friend as you | if there is anything i have done or said i will do everything in my power to make it right | he turned on me sharply and with great emotion told this story: my wife and i lived in loving harmony for over thirty years and when she died recently i was heartbroken | the whole town was sympathetic most of the business houses closed during the hour of the funeral | i had arranged to have ministers whom my wife admired and with them selected passages of scriptures and hymns to which she was devoted | a new minister in town was invited by the others to participate and without my knowledge | i looked over the congregation all mary's friends | i listened to the services which mary herself would have chosen and said to mary's spirit which i knew to be hovering about: 'we are all paying you a loving tribute '| then the new minister had for his part the announcement and reading of a hymn | at the last republican convention at saratoga in order to illustrate the condition of the democratic party you told a story about a boy walking among the children's graves in the old cemetery at peekskill eating green apples and whistling 'nearer my god to thee '| the new minister gave that hymn 'nearer my god to thee '| your story came up in my mind and i burst out laughing | i disgraced myself insulted the memory of mary and i never want to see you again |xxi  national republican conventions when the republican convention met in 1912 i was again a delegate | in my fifty six years of national conventions i never had such an intensely disagreeable experience | i felt it my duty to support president taft for renomination | i thought he had earned it by his excellent administration | i had many ties with him beginning with our associations as graduates of yale and held for him a most cordial regard | i was swayed by my old and unabated love for roosevelt | in that compromise and harmony were impossible | i saw that with the control of the organization and of the convention on the side of mr taft and with the wild support for roosevelt of the delegates from the states which could be relied upon to give republican majorities the nomination of either would be sure defeat | i was again a delegate to the republican convention of 1916 | the party was united | progressives and conservatives were acting together and the convention was in the happiest of moods | it was generally understood that justice hughes would be nominated if he could be induced to resign from the supreme court and accept | the presiding officer of the convention was senator warren g harding | he made a very acceptable keynote speech | his fine appearance his fairness justice and good temper as presiding officer captured the convention | there was a universal sentiment that if hughes declined the party could do no better than to nominate senator harding | it was this impression among the delegates many of whom were also members of the convention of 1920 which led to the selection as the convention's candidate for president of warren g harding | my good mother was a presbyterian and a good calvinist | she believed and impressed upon me the certainty of special providence | it is hard for a republican to think that the election of woodrow wilson was a special providence but if our candidate mr hughes had been elected he would have had a hostile democratic majority in congress | when the united states went into the war as it must have done the president would have been handicapped by this pacifist congress | the draft would have been refused without which our army of four millions could not have been raised | the autocratic measures necessary for the conduct of the war would have been denied | with the conflict between the executive and congress our position would have been impossible and indefensible | i had a personal experience in the convention | chairman harding sent one of the secretaries to me with a message that there was an interval of about an hour when the convention would have nothing to do | it was during such a period the crank had his opportunity and the situation was dangerous and he wished me to come to the platform and fill as much of that hour as possible | i refused on the ground that i was wholly unprepared and it would be madness to attempt to speak to fourteen thousand people in the hall and a hundred million outside | a few minutes afterwards governor whitman chairman of the new york delegation came to me and said: you must be drafted | the chairman will create some business to give you fifteen minutes to think up your speech | i spurred my gray matter as never before and was then introduced and spoke for forty five minutes | i was past eighty two | the speech was a success but when i returned to my seat i remembered what general garfield had so earnestly said to me: you are the only man of national reputation who will speak without preparation | unless you peremptorily and decisively stop yielding you will some day make such a failure as to destroy the reputation of a lifetime | in a letter president harding has this to say in reference to the occasion: just about a year ago 1916 it was my privilege as chairman of the republican convention at chicago to call upon you for an address | there was a hiatus which called for a speech and you so wonderfully met the difficult requirements that i sat in fascinated admiration and have been ready ever since to pay you unstinted tribute | you were ever eloquent in your more active years but i count you the old man eloquent and incomparable in your eighties | may many more helpful and happy years be yours | i was again a delegate to the convention in june 1920 | the republicans had been for eight years out of office during mr wilson's two terms | the delegates were exceedingly anxious to make no mistake and have no friction in the campaign | the two leading candidates general wood and governor lowden had nearly equal strength and were supported by most enthusiastic admirers and advocates | as the balloting continued the rivalry and feeling grew between their friends | it became necessary to harmonize the situation and it was generally believed that this could be best done by selecting senator warren g harding | very few conventions have a dramatic surprise but the nomination of governor coolidge of massachusetts for vice president came about in a very picturesque way | he had been named for president among the others and the speech in his behalf by speaker frederick h gillett was an excellent one | somehow the convention did not seem to grasp all that the governor stood for and how strong he was with each delegate | when the nominations for vice president were called for senator medill mccormick presented senator lenroot of wisconsin in an excellent speech | there were also very good addresses on behalf of the governor of kansas and others | when the balloting was about to start a delegate from oregon who was in the rear of the hall arose and said: mr |chairman  the chairman said: the gentleman from oregon | the oregon delegate in a far reaching voice shouted: mr chairman i nominate for vice president calvin coolidge a one hundred per cent american | the convention went off its feet with a whoop and coolidge was nominated hands down | i again had a personal experience | the committee on resolutions not being prepared to report there was that interval of no business which is the despair of presiding officers of conventions | the crowd suddenly began calling for me | while of course i had thought much on the subject i had not expected to be called upon and had no prepared speech | happily fifteen thousand faces and fifteen thousand voices giving uproarious welcome both steadied and inspired me | though i was past eighty six years of age my voice was in as good condition as at forty and was practically the only one which did fill that vast auditorium | the press of the country featured the effort next day in a way which was most gratifying | among the thousands who greeted me on the streets and in the hotel lobbies with congratulations and efforts to say something agreeable and complimentary i selected one compliment as unique | he was an enthusiast |  chauncey depew he said i have for over twenty years wanted to shake hands with you | your speech was a wonder | i was half a mile off way up under the roof and heard every word of it and it was the only one i was able to hear | that you should do this in your eighty seventh year is a miracle | but then my father was a miracle | on his eighty fifth birthday he was in just as good shape as you are to day and a week afterwards he was dead |xxii  journalists and financiers in reminiscences of my journalistic friends i do not include many of the most valued who are still living | of those who have passed away one of the most faithful and devoted was edward h butler editor and proprietor of the buffalo evening news | mr butler began at the bottom as a newspaper man and very early and rapidly climbed to the top | he secured control of the evening news and soon made one of the most if not the most widely circulated influential and prosperous papers of western new york | personally and through his paper he was for many years my devoted friend | to those he loved he had an unbounded fidelity and generosity | he possessed keen insight and kept thoroughly abreast of public affairs was a journalist of high order | it was my privilege to know charles a dana very well | i first met him when he was on the new york tribune and closely allied with horace greeley | he made the new york sun one of the brightest most original and most quoted newspapers in the united states | his high culture wonderful command of english and refined taste gave to the sun a high literary position and at the same time his audacity and criticism made him a terror to those with whom he differed and his editorials the delight of a reader | personally mr dana was one of the most attractive and charming of men | as assistant secretary of war during lincoln's administration he came in intimate contact with all the public men of that period and as a journalist his study was invaded and he received most graciously men and women famous in every department of intellectual activity | his reminiscences were wonderful and his characterizations remarkable | he might have published an autobiography of rare value and interest | when the elder james gordon bennett died the newspaper world recognized the loss of one of the most remarkable and successful of journalists and publishers | his son had won reputation in the field of sport but his contemporaries doubted his ability to maintain much less increase the sphere of the new york herald | but young bennett soon displayed rare originality and enterprise | he made his newspaper one of national and international importance | by bringing out an edition in paris he conferred a boon upon americans abroad | for many years there was little news from the united states in foreign newspapers but americans crazy for news from home found it in the paris edition of the new york herald | in the telling of our tale we have gone a little in advance of this as it was not till the subsequent monday that lady linlithgow read in the newspaper and told lucy how a man had been arrested on account of the robbery | early on the saturday morning sir griffin tewett was in hertford street and as lizzie afterwards understood there was a terrible scene between both him and lucinda and him and mrs carbuncle | she saw nothing of it herself but mrs carbuncle brought her the tidings | for the last few days mrs carbuncle had been very affectionate in her manner to lizzie thereby showing a great change for during nearly the whole of february the lady who in fact owned the house had hardly been courteous to her remunerative guest expressing more than once a hint that the arrangement which had brought them together had better come to an end |  you see lady eustace mrs carbuncle had once said the trouble about these robberies is almost too much for me | lizzie who was ill at the time and still trembling with constant fear on account of the lost diamonds had taken advantage of her sick condition and declined to argue the question of her removal | now she was supposed to be convalescent but mrs carbuncle had returned to her former ways of affection | no doubt there was cause for this cause that was patent to lizzie herself | lady glencora palliser had called which thing alone was felt by lizzie to alter her position altogether | and then though her diamonds were gone and though the thieves who had stolen them were undoubtedly aware of her secret as to the first robbery though she had herself told that secret to lord george whom she had not seen since she had done so in spite of all these causes for trouble she had of late gradually found herself to be emerging from the state of despondency into which she had fallen while the diamonds were in her own custody | she knew that she was regaining her ascendancy and therefore when mrs carbuncle came to tell her of the grievous things which had been said down stairs between sir griffin and his mistress and to consult her as to the future lizzie was not surprised |  i suppose the meaning of it is that the match must be off said lizzie |  oh dear no pray don't say anything so horrid after all that i have gone through | don't suggest anything of that kind to lucinda |  but surely after what you've told me now he'll never come here again |  oh yes he will | there's no danger about his coming back | it's only a sort of a way he has |  a very disagreeable way said lizzie |  no doubt lady eustace | but then you know you can't have it all sweet | there must be some things disagreeable | as far as i can learn the property will be all right after a few years and it is absolutely indispensable that lucinda should do something | she has accepted him and she must go on with it |  she seems to me to be very unhappy mrs |carbuncle   that was always her way | she was never gay and cheery like other girls | i have never known her once to be what you would call happy |  she likes hunting |  yes because she can gallop away out of herself | i have done all i can for her and she must go on with the marriage now | as for going back it is out of the question | the truth is we couldn't afford it |  then you must keep him in a better humour |  i am not so much afraid about him but dear lady eustace we want you to help us a little |  how can i help you |  you can certainly | could you lend me two hundred and fifty pounds just for six weeks | lizzie's face fell and her eyes became very serious in their aspect | two hundred and fifty pounds |  you know you would have ample security | you need not give lucinda her present till i've paid you and that will be forty five pounds |  thirty five said lizzie with angry decision |  i thought we agreed upon forty five when we settled about the servants' liveries and then you can let the man at the stables know that i am to pay for the carriage and horses | you wouldn't be out of the money hardly above a week or so and it might be the salvation of lucinda just at present |  why don't you ask lord george |  ask lord george | he hasn't got it | it's much more likely that he should ask me | i don't know what's come to lord george this last month past | i did believe that you and he were to come together | i think these two robberies have upset him altogether | but dear lizzie you can let me have it can't you | lizzie did not at all like the idea of lending money and by no means appreciated the security now offered to her | it might be very well for her to tell the man at the stables that mrs carbuncle would pay him her bill but how would it be with her if mrs carbuncle did not pay the bill | and as for her present to lucinda which was to have been a present and regarded by the future lady tewett as a voluntary offering of good will and affection she was altogether averse to having it disposed of in this fashion | and yet she did not like to make an enemy of mrs carbuncle |  i never was so poor in my life before not since i was married said lizzie |  you can't be poor dear lady eustace |  they took my money out of my desk you know ever so much |  forty three pounds said mrs carbuncle who was of course well instructed in all the details of the robbery |  and i don't suppose you can guess what the autumn cost me at portray | the bills are only coming in now and really they sometimes so frighten me that i don't know what i shall do | indeed i haven't got the money to spare |  you'll have every penny of it back in six weeks said mrs carbuncle upon whose face a glow of anger was settling down | she quite intended to make herself very disagreeable to her dear lady eustace or her dear lizzie if she did not get what she wanted and she knew very well how to do it | it must be owned that lizzie was afraid of the woman | it was almost impossible for her not to be afraid of the people with whom she lived | there were so many things against her so many sources of fear |  i am quite sure you won't refuse me such a trifling favour as this said mrs carbuncle with the glow of anger reddening more and more upon her brow |  i don't think i have so much at the bankers said lizzie |  they'll let you overdraw just as much as you please | if the cheque comes back that will be my look out | lizzie had tried that game before and knew that the bankers would allow her to overdraw |  come be a good friend and do it at once said mrs carbuncle |  perhaps i can manage a hundred and fifty said lizzie trembling | mrs carbuncle fought hard for the greater sum but at last consented to take the less and the cheque was written |  this of course won't interfere with lucinda's present said mrs carbuncle as we can make all this right by the horse and carriage account | to this proposition however lady eustace made no answer | soon after lunch at which meal miss roanoke did not show herself lady glencora palliser was announced and sat for about ten minutes in the drawing room | she had come she said especially to give the duke of omnium's compliments to lady eustace and to express a wish on the part of the duke that the lost diamonds might be recovered |  i doubt said lady glencora whether there is any one in england except professed jewellers who knows so much about diamonds as his grace |  or who has so many said mrs carbuncle smiling graciously |  i don't know about that | i suppose there are family diamonds though i have never seen them | but he sympathises with you completely lady eustace | i suppose there is hardly hope now of recovering them | lizzie smiled and shook her head |  isn't it odd that they never should have discovered the thieves | i'm told they haven't at all given it up only unfortunately they'll never get back the necklace | she sat there for about a quarter of an hour and then as she took her leave she whispered a few words to lizzie |  he is to come and see you isn't he | lizzie assented with a smile but without a word |  i hope it will be all right said lady glencora and then she went | lizzie liked this friendship from lady glencora amazingly | perhaps after all nothing more would ever be known about the diamonds and they would simply be remembered as having added a peculiar and not injurious mystery to her life | lord george knew but then she trusted that a benevolent true hearted corsair such as was lord george would never tell the story against her | the thieves knew but surely they if not detected would never tell | and if the story were told by thieves or even by a corsair at any rate half the world would not believe it | what she had feared had feared till the dread had nearly overcome her was public exposure at the hands of the police | if she could escape that the world might still be bright before her | and the interest taken in her by such persons as the duke of omnium and lady glencora was evidence not only that she had escaped it hitherto but also that she was in a fair way to escape it altogether | three weeks ago she would have given up half her income to have been able to steal out of london without leaving a trace behind her | three weeks ago mrs carbuncle was treating her with discourtesy and she was left alone nearly the whole day in her sick bedroom | things were going better with her now | she was recovering her position | mr camperdown who had been the first to attack her was so to say nowhere | he had acknowledged himself beaten | lord fawn whose treatment to her had been so great an injury was coming to see her that very day | her cousin frank though he had never offered to marry her was more affectionate to her than ever | mrs carbuncle had been at her feet that morning borrowing money | and lady glencora palliser the very leading star of fashion had called upon her twice | why should she succumb | she had an income of four thousand pounds a year and she thought that she could remember that her aunt lady linlithgow had but seven hundred pounds | lady fawn with all her daughters had not near so much as she had | and she was beautiful too and young and perfectly free to do what she pleased | no doubt the last eighteen months of her life had been made wretched by those horrid diamonds but they were gone and she had fair reason to hope that the very knowledge of them was gone also | in this condition would it be expedient for her to accept lord fawn when he came | she could not of course be sure that any renewed offer would be the result of his visit but she thought it probable that with care she might bring him to that | why should he come to her if he himself had no such intention | her mind was quite made up on this point that he should be made to renew his offer but whether she would renew her acceptance was quite another question | she had sworn to her cousin frank that she would never do so and she had sworn also that she would be revenged on this wretched lord | now would be her opportunity of accomplishing her revenge and of proving to frank that she had been in earnest | and she positively disliked the man | that probably did not go for much but it went for something even with lizzie eustace | her cousin she did like and lord george | she hardly knew which was her real love though no doubt she gave the preference greatly to her cousin because she could trust him | and then lord fawn was very poor | the other two men were poor also but their poverty was not so objectionable in lizzie's eyes as were the respectable close fisted economies of lord fawn | lord fawn no doubt had an assured income and a real peerage and could make her a peeress | as she thought of it all she acknowledged that there was a great deal to be said on each side and that the necessity of making up her mind then and there was a heavy burthen upon her | exactly at the hour named lord fawn came and lizzie was of course found alone | that had been carefully provided | he was shown up and she received him very gracefully | she was sitting and she rose from her chair and put out her hand for him to take | she spoke no word of greeting but looked at him with a pleasant smile and stood for a few seconds with her hand in his | he was awkward and much embarrassed and she certainly had no intention of lessening his embarrassment |  i hope you are better than you have been he said at last |  i am getting better lord fawn | will you not sit down | he then seated himself placing his hat beside him on the floor but at the moment could not find words to speak |  i have been very ill |  i have been so sorry to hear it |  there has been much to make me ill has there not |  about the robbery you mean |  about many things | the robbery has been by no means the worst though no doubt it frightened me much | there were two robberies lord fawn |  yes i know that |  and it was very terrible | and then i had been threatened with a lawsuit | you have heard that too |  yes i had heard it |  i believe they have given that up now | i understand from my cousin mr greystock who has been my truest friend in all my troubles that the stupid people have found out at last that they had not a leg to stand on | i daresay you have heard that lord fawn | lord fawn certainly had heard in a doubtful way the gist of mr dove's opinion namely that the necklace could not be claimed from the holder of it as an heirloom attached to the eustace family | but he had heard at the same time that mr camperdown was as confident as ever that he could recover the property by claiming it after another fashion | whether or no that claim had been altogether abandoned or had been allowed to fall into abeyance because of the absence of the diamonds he did not know nor did any one know mr camperdown himself having come to no decision on the subject | but lord fawn had been aware that his sister had of late shifted the ground of her inveterate enmity to lizzie eustace making use of the scene which mr gowran had witnessed in lieu of the lady's rapacity in regard to the necklace | it might therefore be assumed lord fawn thought and feared that his strong ground in regard to the necklace had been cut from under his feet | but still it did not behove him to confess that the cause which he had always alleged as the ground for his retreat from the engagement was no cause at all | it might go hard with him should an attempt be made to force him to name another cause | he knew that he would lack the courage to tell the lady that he had heard from his sister that one andy gowran had witnessed a terrible scene down among the rocks at portray | so he sat silent and made no answer to lizzie's first assertion respecting the diamonds | but the necklace was her strong point and she did not intend that he should escape the subject |  if i remember right lord fawn you yourself saw that wretched old attorney once or twice on the subject |  i did see mr camperdown certainly | he is my own family lawyer |  you were kind enough to interest yourself about the diamonds were you not | she asked him this as a question and then waited for a reply |  was it not so |  yes lady eustace it was so |  they were of great value and it was natural continued lizzie |  of course you interested yourself | mr camperdown was full of awful threats against me was he not | i don't know what he was not going to do | he stopped me in the street as i was driving to the station in my own carriage when the diamonds were with me which was a very strong measure i think | and he wrote me ever so many oh such horrid letters | and he went about telling everybody that it was an heirloom didn't he | you know all that lord fawn |  i know that he wanted to recover them |  and did he tell you that he went to a real lawyer somebody who really knew about it mr turbot or turtle or some such name as that and the real lawyer told him that he was all wrong and that the necklace couldn't be an heirloom at all because it belonged to me and that he had better drop his lawsuit altogether | did you hear that |  no i did not hear that |  ah lord fawn you dropped your inquiries just at the wrong place | no doubt you had too many things to do in parliament and the government to go on with them but if you had gone on you would have learned that mr camperdown had just to give it up because he had been wrong from beginning to end | lizzie's words fell from her with extreme rapidity and she had become almost out of breath from the effects of her own energy | lord fawn felt strongly the necessity of clinging to the diamonds as his one great and sufficient justification |  i thought said he that mr camperdown had abandoned his action for the present because the jewels had been stolen |  not a bit of it said lizzie rising suddenly to her legs |  who says so | who dares to say so | whoever says so is is a storyteller | i understand all about that | the action could go on just the same and i could be made to pay for the necklace out of my own income if it hadn't been my own | i am sure lord fawn such a clever man as you and one who has always been in the government and in parliament can see that | and will anybody believe that such an enemy as mr camperdown has been to me persecuting me in every possible way telling lies about me to everybody who tried to prevent my dear darling husband from marrying me that he wouldn't go on with it if he could |  mr camperdown is a very respectable man lady eustace | respectable  talk to me of respectable after all that he has made me suffer | as you were so fond of making inquiries lord fawn you ought to have gone on with them | you never would believe what my cousin said |  your cousin always behaved very badly to me |  my cousin who is a brother rather than a cousin has known how to protect me from the injuries done to me or rather has known how to take my part when i have been injured | my lord as you have been unwilling to believe him why have you not gone to that gentleman who as i say is a real lawyer | i don't know my lord that it need have concerned you at all but as you began you surely should have gone on with it | don't you think so | she was still standing up and small as was her stature was almost menacing the unfortunate under secretary of state who was still seated in his chair |  my lord continued lizzie i have had great wrong done me |  do you mean by me |  yes by you | who else has done it |  i do not think that i have done wrong to any one | i was obliged to say that i could not recognise those diamonds as the property of my wife |  but what right had you to say so | i had the diamonds when you asked me to be your wife |  i did not know it |  mentioning the character and such a crisis arises in your life that naturally and immediately the tears begin to flow | so they did when she was illustrating the part for me | it was a privilege to hear edwin booth as richelieu and hamlet | i have witnessed all the great actors of my time in those characters | none of them equalled edwin booth | for a number of years he was exiled from the stage because his brother wilkes booth was the assassin of president lincoln | his admirers in new york felt that it was a misfortune for dramatic art that so consummate an artist should be compelled to remain in private life | in order to break the spell they united and invited mr booth to give a performance at one of the larger theatres | the house of course was carefully ticketed with selected guests | the older mrs john jacob astor a most accomplished and cultured lady and one of the acknowledged leaders of new york society gave mr booth a dinner in honor of the event | the gathering represented the most eminent talent of new york in every department of the great city's activities | of course mr booth had the seat of honor at the right of the hostess | on the left was a distinguished man who had been a cabinet minister and a diplomat | during the dinner mr evarts said to me: i have known so and so all our active lives | he has been a great success in everything he has undertaken and the wonder of it is that if there was ever an opportunity for him to say or do the wrong thing he never failed | curiously enough the conversation at the dinner ran upon men outliving their usefulness and reputations | several instances were cited where a man from the height of his fame gradually lived on and lived out his reputation | whereupon our diplomat with his fatal facility for saying the wrong thing broke in by remarking in a strident voice: the most remarkable instance of a man dying at the right time for his reputation was abraham lincoln | then he went on to explain how he would have probably lost his place in history through the mistakes of his second term | nobody heard anything beyond the words abraham lincoln | fortunately for the evening and the great embarrassment of mr booth the tact of mrs astor changed the subject and saved the occasion | of all my actor friends none was more delightful either on the stage or in private life than joseph jefferson | he early appealed to me because of his rip van winkle | i was always devoted to washington irving and to the hudson river | all the traditions which have given a romantic touch to different points on that river came from irving's pen | in the days of my youth the influence of irving upon those who were fortunate enough to have been born upon the banks of the hudson was very great in every way | as i met jefferson quite frequently i recall two of his many charming stories | he said he thought at one time that it would be a fine idea to play rip van winkle at the village of catskill around which place was located the story of his hero | his manager selected the supernumeraries from among the farmer boys of the neighborhood | at the point of the play where rip wakes up and finds the lively ghosts of the hendrick hudson crew playing bowls in the mountains he says to each one of them who all look and are dressed alike: are you his brother |  no answered the young farmer who impersonated one of the ghosts mr jefferson i never saw one of these people before | as ghosts are supposed to be silent this interruption nearly broke up the performance | during the spanish american war i came on the same train with mr jefferson from washington | the interest all over the country at that time was the remarkable victory of admiral dewey over the spanish fleet in the harbor of manila | people wondered how dewey could sink every spanish ship and never be hit once himself | jefferson said in his quaint way: everybody including the secretary of the navy and several admirals asked me how that could have happened | i told them the problem might be one which naval officers could not solve but it was very simple for an actor | the failure of the spanish admiral was entirely due to his not having rehearsed | success is impossible without frequent rehearsals | returning for a moment to washington irving one of the most interesting spots near new york is his old home wolfert's roost and also the old church at tarrytown where he worshipped and of which he was an officer for many years | the ivy which partially covers the church was given to mr irving by sir walter scott from abbotsford | at the time when the most famous of british reviewers wrote whoever read or reads an american book | sir walter scott announced the merit and coming fame of washington irving | but as rip van winkle says when he returns after twenty years to his native village how soon we are forgot | there was a dinner given in new york to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of washington irving's birth | i was one of the speakers | in an adjoining room was a company of young and very successful brokers whose triumphs in the market were the envy of speculative america | while i was speaking they came into the room | when i had finished the host at the brokers' dinner called me out and said: we were much interested in your speech | this irving you talked about must be a remarkable man | what is the dinner about | i answered him that it was in celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the birth of washington irving |  well he said pointing to an old gentleman who had sat beside me on the speakers' platform it is astonishing how vigorous he looks at that advanced age | it was my good fortune to hear often and know personally richard mansfield | he was very successful in many parts but his presentation of doctor jekyll and mr hyde was wonderful | at one time he came to me with a well thought out scheme for a national theatre in new york which would be amply endowed and be the home of the highest art in the dramatic profession and at the same time the finest school in the world | he wanted me to draw together a committee of the leading financiers of the country and if possible to impress them so that they would subscribe the millions necessary for carrying out his ideas | i was too busy a man to undertake so difficult a project | one of the colored porters in the wagner palace car service who was always with me on my tours of inspection over the railroad told me an amusing story of mr mansfield's devotion to his art | he was acting as porter on mansfield's car when he was making a tour of the country | this porter was an exceedingly intelligent man | he appreciated mansfield's achievements and played up to his humor in using him as a foil while always acting | when they were in a station william never left the car but remained on guard for the protection of its valuable contents | after a play at kansas city mansfield came into the car very late and said: william where is my manager |  gone to bed sir and so have the other members of the company answered william | then in his most impressive way mansfield said: william they fear me | by the way were you down at the depot to night when the audience from the suburbs were returning to take their trains home |  yes sir answered william though he had not been out of the car |  did you hear any remarks made about my play |  yes sir |  can you give me an instance |  certainly replied william one gentleman remarked that he had been to the theatre all his life but that your acting to night was the most rotten thing he had ever heard or seen |  william shouted mansfield get my winchester and find that man | so mansfield and william went out among the crowds and when william saw a big aggressive looking fellow who he thought would stand up and fight he said: there he is | mansfield immediately walked up to the man covered him with his rifle and shouted: hold up your hands you wretch and take back immediately the insulting remark you made about my play and acting and apologize | the man said: why mr mansfield somebody has been lying to you about me | your performance to night was the best thing i ever saw in my life |  thank you said mansfield shouldering his rifle and added in the most tragic tone: william lead the way back to the car | among the most interesting memories of old new yorkers are the suppers which mr augustin daly gave on the one hundredth performance of a play | like everything which daly did the entertainment was perfect | a frequent and honored guest on these occasions was general sherman who was then retired from the army and living in new york | sherman was a military genius but a great deal more | he was one of the most sensitive men in the world | of course the attraction at these suppers was miss rehan daly's leading lady | her personal charm her velvet voice and her inimitable coquetry made every guest anxious to be her escort | she would pretend to be in doubt whether to accept the attentions of general sherman or myself but when the general began to display considerable irritation the brow of mars was smoothed and the warrior made happy by a gracious acceptance of his arm | on one of these occasions i heard the best after dinner speech of my life | the speaker was one of the most beautiful women in the country miss fanny davenport | that night she seemed to be inspired and her eloquence her wit her humor her sparkling genius together with the impression of her amazing beauty were very effective | p t barnum the showman was a many sided and interesting character | i saw much of him as he rented from the harlem railroad company the madison square garden year after year | barnum never has had an equal in his profession and was an excellent business man | in a broad way he was a man of affairs and with his vast fund of anecdotes and reminiscences very entertaining socially | an englishman of note came to me with a letter of introduction and i asked him whom he would like to meet | he said: i think principally mr p t |barnum  i told this to barnum who knew all about him and said: as a gentleman he knows how to meet me | when i informed my english friend he expressed his regret and at once sent barnum his card and an invitation for dinner | at the dinner barnum easily carried off the honors with his wonderful fund of unusual adventures | my first contact with mr barnum occurred many years before when i was a boy up in peekskill | at that time he had a museum and a show in a building at the corner of ann street and broadway opposite the old astor house | by skilful advertising he kept people all over the country expecting something new and wonderful and anxious to visit his show | there had been an indian massacre on the western plains | the particulars filled the newspapers and led to action by the government in retaliation | barnum advertised that he had succeeded in securing the sioux warriors whom the government had captured and who would re enact every day the bloody battle in which they were victorious | it was one of the hottest afternoons in august when i appeared there from the country | the indians were on the top floor under the roof | the performance was sufficiently blood curdling to satisfy the most exacting reader of a penny dreadful | after the performance when the audience left i was too fascinated to go and remained in the rear of the hall gazing at these dreadful savages | one of them took off his head gear dropped his tomahawk and scalping knife and said in the broadest irish to his neighbor: moike if this weather don't cool off i will be nothing but a grease spot | this was among the many illusions which have been dissipated for me in a long life | notwithstanding that i still have faith and dearly love to be fooled but not to have the fraud exposed | wyndham the celebrated english actor was playing one night in new york | he saw me in the audience and sent a messenger inviting me to meet him at supper at the hoffman house | after the theatre i went to the hotel asked at the desk in what room the theatrical supper was and found there bronson howard the playwright and some others | i told them the object of my search and mr howard said: you are just in the right place | the english actor came later and also a large number of other guests | i was very much surprised and flattered at being made practically the guest of honor | in the usual and inevitable after dinner speeches i joined enthusiastically in the prospects of american contributions to drama and especially the genius of bronson howard | it developed afterwards that the actors' dinner was set for several nights later and that i was not invited or expected to this entertainment which was given by mr howard to my actor friend but by concert of action between the playwright and the actor the whole affair was turned into a dinner to me | broadway was delighted at the joke but did not have a better time over it than i did | the supper parties after the play which wyndham gave were among the most enjoyable entertainments in london | his guests represented the best in society government art literature and drama | his dining room was built and furnished like the cabin of a yacht and the illusion was so complete that sensitive guests said they felt the rolling of the sea | one evening he said to me: i expect a countryman of yours a charming fellow but poor devil he has only one hundred and fifty thousand pounds a year | he is still young and all the managing mothers are after him for their daughters | when the prosperous american with an income of three quarters of a million arrived i needed no introduction | i knew him very well and about his affairs | he had culture was widely travelled was both musical and artistic and his fad was intimacy with prominent people | his dinners were perfection and invitations were eagerly sought | on the plea of delicate health he remained a brief period in the height of the season in london and paris | but during those few weeks he gave all that could be done by lavish wealth and perfect taste and did it on an income of twenty thousand dollars a year | most of the year he lived modestly in the mountains of switzerland or in eastern travel but was a welcome guest of the most important people in many lands | the only deceit about it if it was a deceit was that he never went out of his way to deny his vast wealth and as he never asked for anything there was no occasion to publish his inventory | the pursuing mothers and daughters never succeeded before his flight in leading him far enough to ask for a show down | many times during my visits to europe i have been besieged to know the income of a countryman | on account of the belief over there in the generality of enormous american fortunes it is not difficult to create the impression of immense wealth | while the man would have to make a statement and give references the lady's story is seldom questioned | i have known some hundreds and thousands of dollars become in the credulous eyes of suitors as many millions and a few millions become multimillions | in several instances the statements of the lady were accepted as she achieved her ambition | for a tired man who has grown stale with years of unremitting work i know of no relief and recuperation equal to taking a steamer and crossing the ocean to europe | i did this for a few weeks in midsummer many times and always with splendid and most refreshing results | with fortunate introductions i became acquainted with many of the leading men of other countries and this was a liberal education | there is invariably a concert for charities to help the sailors on every ship | i had many amusing experiences in presiding on these occasions | i remember once we were having a rough night of it and one of our artists a famous singer who had made a successful tour of the united states was a little woman and her husband a giant | he came to me during the performance and said: my wife is awfully seasick but she wants to sing and i want her to | in the intervals of her illness she is in pretty good shape for a little while | if you will stop everything when you see me coming in with her she will do her part | i saw him rushing into the saloon with his wife in his arms and immediately announced her for the next number | she made a great triumph but at the proper moment was caught up by her husband and carried again to the deck | he said to me afterwards: my wife was not at her best last night because there is a peculiarity about seasickness and singers the lower notes in which she is most effective are not at such times available or in working order | augustin daly did a great service to the theatre by his wonderful genius as a manager | he discovered talent everywhere and encouraged it | he trained his company with the skill of a master and produced in his theatres here and in london a series of wonderful plays | he did not permit his artists to take part as a rule in these concerts on the ship but it so happened that on one occasion we celebrated the fourth of july | i went to mr daly and asked him if he would not as an american take the management of the whole celebration | this appealed to him and he selected the best talent from his company | among them was ada rehan | i knew miss rehan when she was in the stock company at albany in her early days | with mr daly who discovered her she soon developed into a star of the first magnitude | mr daly persisted on my presiding and introducing the artists and also delivering the fourth of july oration | the celebration was so successful in the saloon that mr daly had it repeated the next night in the second cabin and the night after that in the steerage | the steerage did its best and was clothed in the finest things which it was carrying back to astonish the old folks in the old country and its enthusiasm was greater if possible than the welcome which had greeted the artists among the first and second cabin passengers | after miss rehan had recited her part and been encored and encored i found her in tears | i said: miss rehan your triumph has been so great that it should be laughter |  yes she said but it is so pathetic to see these people who probably never before met with the highest art | among the many eminent english men of letters who at one time came to the united states was matthew arnold | the american lecture promoters were active in securing these gentlemen and the american audiences were most appreciative | many came with letters of introduction to me | mr arnold was a great poet critic and writer and an eminent professor at oxford university and well known to our people | his first address was at chickering hall to a crowded house | beyond the first few rows no one could hear him | explaining this he said to me: my trouble is that my lectures at the university are given in small halls and to limited audiences | i advised him that before going any farther he should secure an elocutionist and accustom himself to large halls otherwise his tour would be a disappointment | he gave me an amusing account of his instructor selecting chickering hall where he had failed and making him repeat his lecture while the instructor kept a progressive movement farther and farther from the stage until he reached the rear seats when he said he was satisfied | it is a tribute to the versatility of this great author that he learned his lesson so well that his subsequent lectures in different parts of the country were very successful | once mr arnold said to me: the lectures which i have prepared are for university audiences to which i am accustomed | i have asked my american manager to put me only in university towns but i wish you would look over my engagements | having done this i remarked: managers are looking for large and profitable audiences | there is no university or college in any of these towns though one of them has an inebriate home and another an insane asylum | however both of these cities have a cultured population | your noisiest and probably most appreciative audience will be at the one which is a large railroad terminal | our railroad people are up to date | i saw mr arnold on his return from his tour | the description he gave of his adventures was very picturesque and the income had been exceedingly satisfactory and beyond expectation | describing the peculiarities of the chairmen who introduced him he mentioned one of them who said: ladies and gentlemen next week we will have in our course the most famous magician there is in the world and the week after i am happy to say we shall be honored by the presence of a great opera singer a wonderful artist | for this evening it is my pleasure to introduce to you that distinguished english journalist mr edwin arnold | mr arnold began his lecture with a vigorous denial that he was edwin arnold whom i judged he did not consider in his class | mr arnold received in new york and in the larger cities which he visited the highest social attention from the leading families | i met him several times and found that he never could be reconciled to our two most famous dishes terrapin and canvasback duck the duck nearly raw | he said indignantly to one hostess who chided him for his neglect of the canvasback: madam when your ancestors left england two hundred and fifty years ago the english of that time were accustomed to eat their meat raw now they cook it | to which the lady answered: i am not familiar with the customs of my ancestors but i know that i pay my chef who cooked the duck three hundred dollars a month | we were all very fond of thackeray | he did not have the general popularity of charles dickens nor did he possess dickens's dramatic power but he had a large and enthusiastic following among our people | it was an intellectual treat and revelation to listen to him | that wonderful head of his seemed to be an enormous and perennial fountain of wit and wisdom | they had a good story of him at the century club which is our athenaeum that when taken there after a lecture by his friends they gave him the usual centurion supper of those days: saddlerock oysters | the saddlerock of that time was nearly as large as a dinner plate | thackeray said to his host: what do i do with this animal | the host answered: we americans swallow them whole | thackeray always equal to the demand of american hospitality closed his eyes and swallowed the oyster and the oyster went down | when he had recovered he remarked: i feel as if i had swallowed a live baby | we have been excited at different times to an absorbing extent by the stories of explorers | none were more generally read than the adventures of the famous missionary david livingstone in africa | when livingstone was lost the whole world saluted henry m stanley as he started upon his famous journey to find him | stanley's adventures his perils and escapes had their final success in finding livingstone | the story enraptured and thrilled every one | the british government knighted him and when he returned to the united states he was sir henry stanley | he was accompanied by his wife a beautiful and accomplished woman and received with open arms | i met sir henry many times at private and public entertainments and found him always most interesting | the lotos club gave him one of its most famous dinners famous to those invited and to those who spoke | it was arranged that he should begin his lecture tour of the united states in new york | at the request of sir henry and his committee i presided and introduced him at the metropolitan opera house | the great auditorium was crowded to suffocation and the audience one of the finest and most sympathetic | we knew little at that time of central africa and its people and the curiosity was intense to hear from sir henry a personal and intimate account of his wonderful discoveries and experiences | he thought that as his african life was so familiar to him it must be the same to everybody else | as a result instead of a thriller he gave a commonplace talk on some literary subject which bored the audience and cast a cloud over a lecture tour which promised to be one of the most successful | of course sir henry's effort disappointed his audience the more because their indifference and indignation depressed him and he did not do justice to himself or the uninteresting subject which he had selected | he never again made the same mistake and the tour was highly remunerative | for nearly a generation there was no subject which so interested the american people as the adventures of explorers | i met many of them eulogized them in speeches at banquets given in their honor | the people everywhere were open eyed open eared and open mouthed in their welcome and eagerness to hear them | it is a commentary upon the fickleness of popular favor that the time was so short before these universal favorites dropped out of popular attention and recollection |xxiv  societies and public banquets the most unique experience in my life has been the dinners given to me by the montauk club of brooklyn on my birthday | the montauk is a social club of high standing whose members are of professional and business life and different political and religious faiths | thirty years ago mr charles a moore was president of the club | he was a prominent manufacturer and a gentleman of wide influence in political and social circles | mr mckinley offered him the position of secretary of the navy which mr moore declined | he came to me one day with a committee from the club and said: the montauk wishes to celebrate your birthday | we know that it is on the 23d of april and that you have two distinguished colleagues who also have the 23d as their birthday shakespeare and st george | we do not care to include them but desire only to celebrate yours | the club has continued these celebrations for thirty years by an annual dinner | the ceremonial of the occasion is a reception then dinner and after an introduction by the president a speech by myself | to make a new speech every year which will be of interest to those present and those who read it is not easy | these festivities had a fortunate beginning | in thinking over what i should talk about at the first dinner i decided to get some fun out of the municipality of brooklyn by a picturesque description of its municipal conditions | it was charged in the newspapers that there had been serious graft in some public improvements which had been condoned by the authorities and excused by an act of the legislature | it had also been charged that the common council had been giving away valuable franchises to their favorites | of course this presented a fine field of contrast between ancient and modern times | in ancient times grateful citizens erected statues to eminent men who had deserved well of their country in military or civic life but brooklyn had improved upon the ancient model through the grant of public utilities | the speech caused a riot after the dinner as to its propriety many taking the ground that it was a criticism and therefore inappropriate to the occasion | however the affair illustrated a common experience of mine that unexpected results will sometimes flow from a bit of humor if the humor has concealed in it a stick of dynamite | the brooklyn pulpit which is the most progressive in the world took the matter up and aroused public discussion on municipal affairs | the result was the formation of a committee of one hundred citizens to investigate municipal conditions | they found that while the mayor and some other officials were high toned and admirable officers yet the general administration of the city government had in the course of years become so bad that there should be a general reformation | the reform movement was successful it spread over to new york and there again succeeded and the movement for municipal reform became general in the country | the next anniversary dinner attracted an audience larger than the capacity of the club and every one of the thirty has been an eminent success | for many years the affair has received wide publicity in the united states and has sometimes been reported in foreign newspapers | i remember being in london with the late lieutenant governor woodruff when we saw these head lines at a news stand on the strand: speech by chauncey depew at his birthday dinner at the montauk club brooklyn | during this nearly third of a century the membership of the club has changed sons having succeeded fathers and new members have been admitted but the celebration seems to grow in interest | during the last fourteen years the president of the club has been mr william h english | he has done so much for the organization in every way that the members would like to have him as their executive officer for life | mr english is a splendid type of the american who is eminently successful in his chosen career and yet has outside interest for the benefit of the public | modest to a degree and avoiding publicity he nevertheless is the motive power of many movements progressive and charitable | twenty four years ago a company of public spirited women in the city of des moines iowa organized a club | they named it after me | for nearly a quarter of a century it has been an important factor in the civic life of des moines | it has with courage intelligence and independence done excellent work | at the time of its organization there were few if any such organizations in the country and it may claim the position of pioneer in women's activity in public affairs | happily free from the internal difficulties and disputes which so often wreck voluntary associations the chauncey depew club is stronger than ever | it looks forward with confidence to a successful celebration of its quarter of a century | i have never been able to visit the club but have had with it frequent and most agreeable correspondence | it always remembers my birthday in the most gratifying way | i am grateful to its members for bestowing upon me one of the most pleasurable compliments of my life | a public dinner is a fine form of testimonial | i have had many in my life celebrating other things than my birthday | one of the most notable was given me by the citizens of chicago in recognition of my efforts to make their great columbian exhibition a success | justice john m harlan presided and distinguished men were present from different parts of the country and representing great interests | probably the speech which excited the most comment was a radical attack of andrew carnegie on the government of great britain in submitting to the authority of a king or a queen | canada was represented by some of the high officials of that self governing colony | the canadians are more loyal to the english form of government than are the english themselves | my peppery scotch friend aroused a canadian official who returned his assault with vigor and interest | it is a very valuable experience for an american to attend the annual banquet of the american chamber of commerce in paris | the french government recognizes the affair by having a company of their most picturesquely uniformed soldiers standing guard both inside and outside the hall | the highest officials of the french government always attend and make speeches | the american ambassador replies in a speech partly in english and if he is sufficiently equipped partly in french | general horace porter and henry white were equally happy both in their native language and in that of the french | the french statesmen however were so fond of myron t herrick that they apparently not only grasped his cordiality but understood perfectly his eloquence | the honor has several times been assigned to me of making the american speech in unadulterated american | the french may not have understood but with their quick apprehension the applause or laughter of the americans was instantly succeeded by equal manifestations on the part of the french | among the many things which we have inherited from our english ancestry are public dinners and after dinner speeches | the public dinner is of importance in great britain and utilized for every occasion | it is to the government the platform where the ministers can lay frankly before the country matters which they could not develop in the house of commons | through the dinner speech they open the way and arouse public attention for measures which they intend to propose to parliament and in this way bring the pressure of public opinion to their support | in the same way every guild and trade have their festive functions with serious purpose and so have religious philanthropic economic and sociological movements | we have gone quite far in this direction but have not perfected the system as they have on the other side | i have been making after dinner speeches for sixty years to all sorts and conditions of people and on almost every conceivable subject | i have found these occasions of great value because under the good fellowship of the occasion an unpopular truth can be sugar coated with humor and received with applause while in the processes of digestion the next day it is working with the audience and through the press in the way the pill was intended | a popular audience will forgive almost anything with which they do not agree if the humorous way in which it is put tickles their risibilities | mr gladstone was very fine at the lord mayor's dinner at guild hall where the prime minister develops his policies | so it was with lord salisbury and balfour but the prince of after dinner speakers in england is lord rosebery | he has the humor the wit and the artistic touch which fascinates and enraptures his audience | i have met in our country all the men of my time who have won fame in this branch of public address | the most remarkable in effectiveness and inspiration was henry ward beecher | a banquet was always a success if it could have among its speakers william m evarts joseph h choate james s brady judge john r brady general horace porter or robert g ingersoll | after general grant settled in new york he was frequently a guest at public dinners and always produced an impression by simple direct and effective oratory | general sherman on the other hand was an orator as well as a fighter | he never seemed to be prepared but out of the occasion would give soldierly graphic and picturesque presentations of thought and description | not to have heard on these occasions robert g ingersoll was to have missed being for the evening under the spell of a magician | i have been frequently asked if i could remember occasions of this kind which were of more than ordinary interest | after dinner oratory while most attractive at the time is evanescent but some incidents are interesting in memory | at the time of queen victoria's jubilee i was present where a representative of canada was called upon for a speech | with the exception of the canadian and myself the hosts and guests were all english | my canadian friend enlarged upon the wonders of his country | a statement of its marvels did not seem sufficient for him unless it was augmented by comparisons with other countries to the glory of canada and so he compared canada with the united states | canada had better and more enduring institutions she had a more virile intelligent and progressive population and she had protected herself as the united states did not against undesirable immigration and in everything which constituted an up to date progressive healthy and hopeful commonwealth she was far in advance of the united states | i was called upon immediately afterwards and said i would agree with the distinguished gentleman from canada that in one thing at least canada was superior to the united states and it was that she had far more land but it was mostly ice | i regret to remember that my canadian friend lost his temper | one of the historical dinners of new york which no one will forget who was there was just after the close of the civil war or as my dear old friend colonel watterson called it the war between the states | the principal guests were general sherman and henry w grady of atlanta ga | general sherman in his speech described the triumphant return of the union army to washington its review by the president and then its officers and men returning to private life and resuming their activities and industries as citizens | it was a word picture of wonderful and startling picturesqueness and power and stirred an audience composed largely of veterans who had been participants both in the battles and in the parades to the highest degree of enthusiasm | mr grady followed | he was a young man with rare oratorical gifts | he described the return of the confederate soldiers to their homes after the surrender at appomattox | they had been four years fighting and marching | they were ragged and poor | they returned to homes and farms many of which had been devastated | they had no capital and rarely animals or farming utensils necessary to begin again | but with superb courage not only on their own part but with the assistance of their wives sisters and daughters they made the desert land flourish and resurrected the country | this remarkable description of grady which i only outline came as a counterpart to the triumphant epic of general sherman | the effect was electric and beyond almost any that have ever occurred in new york or anywhere and grady sprang into international fame | joseph h choate was a most dangerous fellow speaker to his associates who spoke before him | i had with him many encounters during fifty years and many times enjoyed being the sufferer by his wit and humor | on one occasion choate won the honors of the evening by an unexpected attack | there is a village in western new york which is named after me | the enterprising inhabitants boring for what might be under the surface of their ground discovered natural gas | according to american fashion they immediately organized a company and issued a prospectus for the sale of the stock | the prospectus fell into the hands of mr choate | with great glee he read it and then with emphasis the name of the company: the depew natural gas company limited and waving the prospectus at me shouted: why limited | there have been two occasions in mr choate's after dinner speeches much commented upon both in this country and abroad | as i was present on both evenings it seems the facts ought to be accurately stated | the annual dinner of the friendly sons of st patrick occurred during one of the years when the home rule question was most acute in england and actively discussed here | at the same time our irish fellow citizens with their talent for public life had captured all the offices in new york city | they had the mayor the majority of the board of aldermen and a large majority of the judges | when mr choate spoke he took up the home rule question and without indicating his own views said substantially: we yankees used to be able to govern ourselves but you irish have come here and taken the government away from us | you have our entire city administration in your hands and you do with us as you like | we are deprived of home rule | now what you are clamoring for both at home and abroad is home rule for ireland | with such demonstrated ability in capturing the greatest city on the western continent and one of the greatest in the world why don't you go back to ireland and make as you would home rule there a success | i was called a few minutes afterwards to a conference of the leading irishmen present | i was an honorary member of that society and they were in a high state of indignation | the more radical thought that mr choate's speech should be resented at once | however those who appreciated its humor averted hostile action but mr choate was never invited to an irish banquet again | the second historical occasion was when the scotch honored their patron saint st andrew | the attendance was greater than ever before and the interest more intense because the earl of aberdeen was present | the earl was at that time governor general of canada but to the scotchmen he was much more than that because he was the chief of the clan gordon | the earl came to the dinner in full highland costume | lady aberdeen and the ladies of the vice regal court were in the gallery | i sat next to the earl and choate sat next to me | choate said: chauncey are aberdeen's legs bare | i looked under the table cloth and discovered that they were naturally so because of his costume | i answered: choate they are | i thought nothing of it until choate began his speech in which he said: i was not fully informed by the committee of the importance of the occasion | i did not know that the earl of aberdeen was to be here as a guest of honor | i was especially and unfortunately ignorant that he was coming in the full panoply of his great office as chief of clan gordon | if i had known that i would have left my trousers at home | aberdeen enjoyed it the ladies in the gallery were amused but the scotch were mad and choate lost invitations to future scotch dinners | few appreciate the lure of the metropolis | it attracts the successful to win greater success with its larger opportunities | it has resistless charm with the ambitious and the enterprising | new york with its suburbs which are really a part of itself is the largest city in the world | it is the only true cosmopolitan one | it has more irish than any city in ireland more germans and italians than any except the largest cities in germany or italy | it has more southerners than are gathered in any place in any southern state and the same is true of westerners and those from the pacific coast and new england except in chicago san francisco or boston | there is also a large contingent from the west indies south america and canada | the people who make up the guests at a great dinner are the survival of the fittest of these various settlers in new york | while thousands fail and go back home or drop by the way these men have made their way by superior ability foresight and adaptability through the fierce competitions of the great city | they are unusually keen witted and alert | for the evening of the banquet they leave behind their business and its cares and are bent on being entertained amused and instructed | they are a most catholic audience broad minded hospitable and friendly to ideas whether they are in accord with them or not providing they are well presented | there is one thing they will not submit to and that is being bored | these functions are usually over by midnight and rarely last so long while out in the country and in other towns it is no unusual thing to have a dinner with speeches run along until the early hours of the next morning | while public men politicians and aspiring orators seek their opportunities upon this platform in new york few succeed and many fail | it is difficult for a stranger to grasp the situation and adapt himself at once to its atmosphere | i have narrated in preceding pages some remarkable successes and will give a few instances of very able and distinguished men who lost touch of their audiences | one of the ablest men in the senate was senator john t morgan of alabama | i was fond of him personally and admired greatly his many and varied talents | he was a most industrious and admirable legislator and a debater of rare influence | he was a master of correct and scholarly english and one of the very few who never went to the reporters' room to correct his speeches | as they were always perfect he let them stand as they were delivered | senator morgan was a great card on a famous occasion among the many well known men who were also to speak | senator elihu root presided with his usual distinction | senator morgan had a prepared speech which he read | it was unusually long but very good | on account of his reputation the audience was for such an audience wonderfully patient and frequent and enthusiastic in its applause | mistaking his favorable reception senator morgan after he had finished the manuscript started in for an extended talk | after the hour had grown to nearly two the audience became impatient and the senator again mistaking its temper thought they had become hostile and announced that at many times and many places he had been met with opposition but that he could not be put down or silenced | mr root did the best he could to keep the peace but the audience who were anxious to hear the other speakers gave up hope and began to leave with the result that midnight saw an empty hall with a presiding officer and an orator | at another great political dinner i sat beside governor oglesby of illinois | he was famous as a war governor and as a speaker | there were six speakers on the dais of whom i was one | happily my turn came early | the governor said to me: how much of the gospel can these tenderfeet stand |  well governor i answered there are six speakers to night and the audience will not allow the maximum of time occupied to be more than thirty minutes | any one who exceeds that will lose his crowd and worse than that he may be killed by the eloquent gentlemen who are bursting with impatience to get the floor and who are to follow him |  why said the governor i don't see how any one can get started in thirty minutes |  well i cautioned please do not be too long | when the midnight hour struck the hall was again practically empty the governor in the full tide of his speech which evidently would require about three hours and the chairman declared the meeting adjourned | senator foraker of ohio who was one of the appointed speakers told me the next morning that at the fifth avenue hotel where he was stopping he was just getting into bed when the governor burst into his room and fairly shouted: foraker no wonder new york is almost always wrong | you saw to night that it would not listen to the truth | now i want to tell you what i intended to say | he was shouting with impassioned eloquence his voice rising until through the open windows it reached madison square park when the watchman burst in and said: sir the guests in this hotel will not stand that any longer but if you must finish your speech i will take you out in the park | during cleveland's administration one of the new york banquets became a national affair | the principal speaker was the secretary of the interior lucius q c lamar who afterwards became united states senator and justice of the supreme court | mr lamar was one of the ablest and most cultured men in public life and a fine orator | i was called upon so late that it was impossible to follow any longer the serious discussions of the evening and what the management and the audience wanted from me was some fun | lamar with his johnsonian periods and the lofty style of edmund burke furnished an opportunity for a little pleasantry | he came to me when i had finished in great alarm and said: my appearance here is not an ordinary one and does not permit humor | i am secretary of the interior and the representative of the president and his administration | my speech is really the message of the president to the whole country and i wish you would remedy any impression which the country might otherwise receive from your humor | this i was very glad to do but it was an instance of which i have met many of a very distinguished and brilliant gentleman taking himself too seriously | at another rather solemn function of this kind i performed the same at the request of the management but with another protest from the orator and his enmity | in reminiscing after he retired from the presidency mr cleveland spoke to me of his great respect and admiration for mr lamar | cleveland's speeches were always short | his talent was for compression and concentration and he could not understand the necessity for an effort of great length | he told me that while justice lamar was secretary of the interior he came to him one day and said: mr president i have accepted an invitation to deliver an address in the south and as your administration may be held responsible for what i say i wish you would read it over and make any corrections or suggestions | mr cleveland said the speech was extraordinarily long though very good and when he returned it to secretary lamar he said to him: that speech will take at least three hours to deliver | a northern audience would never submit to over an hour | don't you think you had better cut it down | the secretary replied: no mr president a southern audience expects three hours and would be better satisfied with five | justice miller one of the ablest of the judges of the supreme court at that time was the principal speaker on another occasion | he was ponderous to a degree and almost equalled in the emphasis of his utterances what was once said of daniel webster that every word weighed twelve pounds | i followed him | the attorney general of the united states who went back to washington the next day with justice miller told me that as soon as they had got on the train the justice commenced to complain that i had wholly misunderstood his speech and that no exaggeration of interpretation would warrant what i said | the judge saw no humor in my little effort to relieve the situation and took it as a reply of opposing counsel | he said that the justice took it up from another phase after leaving philadelphia and resumed his explanation from another angle as to what he meant after they reached baltimore | when the train arrived at its destination and they separated in the washington station the justice turned to the attorney general and said: damn depew | good night | such are the perils of one who good naturedly yields to the importunities of a committee of management who fear the failure with their audience of their entertainment | the great dinners of new york are the chamber of commerce which is a national function as were also for a long time during the presidency of mr choate those of the new england society | the annual banquets of the irish scotch english welsh holland st nicholas and the french are also most interesting and sometimes by reason of the presence of a national or international figure assume great importance | the dinner which the pilgrims society tenders to the british ambassador gives him an opportunity without the formalities and conventions of his office of speaking his mind both to the united states and to his own people | the annual banquets of the state societies are now assuming greater importance | each state has thousands of men who have been or still are citizens but who live in new york | those dinners attract the leading politicians of their several states | it is a platform for the ambitious to be president and sometimes succeeds | garfield made a great impression at one of these state dinners so did foraker and at the last dinner of the ohio society the star was senator warren g harding | on one occasion when mckinley and garfield were present in the course of my speech i made a remark which has since been adopted as a sort of motto by the buckeye state | ohio i think has passed virginia as a mother of presidents | it is remarkable that the candidates of both great parties are now of that state | i said in the closing of my speech alluding to the distinguished guests and their prospects: some men have greatness thrust upon them some are born great and some are born in ohio | one of the greatest effects produced by a speech was by henry ward beecher at an annual dinner of the friendly sons of st patrick | at the time the home rule question was more than ordinarily acute and fenianism was rabid | while mr beecher had great influence upon his audience his audience had equal influence upon him | as he enlarged upon the wrongs of ireland the responses became more enthusiastic and finally positively savage | this stirred the orator up till he gave the wildest approval to direct action and revolution with corresponding cheers from the diners standing and cheering | mr beecher was explaining that speech for about a year afterwards | i was a speaker on the same platform | mr beecher always arrived late and everybody thought it was to get the applause as he came in but he explained to me that it was due to his method of preparation | he said his mind would not work freely until three hours after he had eaten | many speakers have told me the same thing | he said when he had a speech to make at night whether it was at a dinner or elsewhere that he took his dinner in the middle of the day and then a glass of milk and crackers at five o'clock with nothing afterwards | then in the evening his mind was perfectly clear and under absolute control | the lotos club has been for fifty years to new york what the savage club is to london | it attracts as its guests the most eminent men of letters who visit this country | its entertainments are always successful | for twenty nine years it had for its president mr frank r lawrence a gentleman with a genius for introducing distinguished strangers with most felicitous speeches and a committee who selected with wonderful judgment the other speakers of the evening | a successor to mr lawrence and of equal merit has been found in chester s lord now president of the lotos club | mr lord was for more than a third of a century managing editor of the new york sun and is now chancellor of the university of the state of new york | i remember one occasion where the most tactful man who ever appeared before his audience slipped his trolley and that was bishop potter | the bishop was a remarkably fine preacher and an unusually attractive public speaker and past master of all the social amenities of life | the guest of the evening was the famous canon kingsley author of hypatia and other works at that time universally popular | the canon had the largest and reddest nose one ever saw | the bishop among the pleasantries of his introduction alluded to this headlight of religion and literature | the canon fell from grace and never forgave the bishop | on lotos nights i have heard at their best lord houghton statesman and poet mark twain stanley the explorer and i consider it one of the distinctions as well as pleasures of my life to have been a speaker at the lotos on more occasions than any one else during the last half century | in mr joseph pulitzer's early struggles with his paper the new york world the editorial columns frequently had very severe attacks on mr william h vanderbilt and the new york central railroad | they were part of course of attacks upon monopoly | i was frequently included in these criticisms | the lotos club gave a famous dinner to george augustus sala the english writer and journalist | i found myself seated beside mr pulitzer whom i had never met | when i was called upon to speak i introduced in what i had to say about the distinguished guest this bit of audacity | i said substantially in addition to mr sala: we have with us to night a great journalist who comes to the metropolis from the wild and woolly west | after he had purchased the world he came to me and said 'chauncey depew i have a scheme which i am sure will benefit both of us | everybody is envious of the prestige of the new york central and the wealth of mr vanderbilt | you are known as his principal adviser | now if in my general hostility to monopoly i include mr vanderbilt and the new york central as principal offenders i must include you because you are the champion in your official relationship of the corporation and of its policies and activities | i do not want you to have any feeling against me because of this | the policy will secure for the world everybody who is not a stockholder in the new york central or does not possess millions of money | when mr vanderbilt finds that you are attacked he is a gentleman and broad minded enough to compensate you and will grant to you both significant promotion and a large increase in salary ' | then i added: well gentlemen i have only to say that mr pulitzer's experiment has been eminently successful | he has made his newspaper a recognized power and a notable organ of public opinion its fortunes are made and so are his and in regard to myself all he predicted has come true both in promotion and in enlargement of income | when i sat down mr pulitzer grasped me by the hand and said: chauncey depew you are a mighty good fellow | i have been misinformed about you | you will have friendly treatment hereafter in any newspaper which i control | the gridiron club of washington because of both its ability and genius and especially its national position furnishes a wonderful platform for statesmen | its genius in creating caricatures and fake pageants of current political situations at the capital and its public men is most remarkable | the president always attends and most of the cabinet and justices of the supreme court | the ambassadors and representatives of the leading governments represented in washington are guests and so are the best known senators and representatives of the time | the motto of the club is reporters are never present | ladies always present | though the association is made up entirely of reporters the secrecy is so well kept that the speakers are unusually frank | there was a famous contest one night there however between president roosevelt and senator foraker who at the time were intensely antagonistic which can never be forgotten by those present | there was a delightful interplay between william j bryan and president roosevelt when bryan charged the president with stealing all his policies and ideas | if the speaker grasped the peculiarities of his audience and its temperament his task was at once the most difficult and the most delightful and my friend mr arthur dunn has performed most useful service in embalming a portion of gridiron history in his volume gridiron nights | pierpont morgan the greatest of american bankers was much more than a banker | he had a wonderful collection in his library and elsewhere of rare books and works of art | he was always delightful on the social side | he was very much pleased when he was elected president of the new england society | the annual dinner that year was a remarkably brilliant affair | it was the largest in the history of the organization | the principal speaker was william everett son of the famous edward everett and himself a scholar of great acquirements and culture | his speech was another evidence of a very superior man mistaking his audience | he was principal of the adams academy that great preparatory institution for harvard university and he had greatly enlarged its scope and usefulness | mr everett evidently thought that the guests of the new england society of new york would be composed of men of letters educators and harvard graduates | instead of that the audience before him were mainly bankers and successful business men whose puritan characteristics had enabled them to win great success in the competitions in the great metropolis in every branch of business | they were out for a good time and little else | mr everett produced a ponderous mass of manuscript and began reading on the history of new england education and the influence upon it of the cambridge school | he had more than an hour of material and lost his audience in fifteen minutes | no efforts of the chairman could bring them to attention and finally the educator lost that control of himself which he was always teaching to the boys and threw his manuscript at the heads of the reporters | from their reports in their various newspapers the next day they did not seem to have absorbed the speech by this original method | choate and i were both to speak and choate came first | as usual he threw a brick at me | he mentioned that a reporter had come to him and said: mr choate i have depew's speech carefully prepared with the applause and laughter already in | i want yours | of course no reporter had been to either of us | mr choate had in his speech an unusual thing for him a long piece of poetry | when my turn came to reply i said: the reporter came to me as mr choate has said and made the remark: 'i already have choate's speech | it has in it a good deal of poetry '| i asked the reporter: 'from what author is the poetry taken '| he answered: 'i do not know the author but the poetry is so bad i think choate has written it himself ' | mr choate told me a delightful story of his last interview with mr evarts before he sailed for europe to take up his ambassadorship at the court of st james |  i called he said on mr evarts to bid him good by | he had been confined to his room by a fatal illness for a long time | 'choate ' he said 'i am delighted with your appointment | you eminently deserve it and you are pre eminently fit for the place | you have won the greatest distinction in our profession and have harvested enough of its rewards to enable you to meet the financial responsibilities of this post without anxiety | you will have a most brilliant and useful career in diplomacy but i fear i will never see you again ' | mr choate said: mr evarts we have had a delightful partnership of over forty years and when i retire from diplomacy and resume the practice of the law i am sure you and i will go on together again for many years in the same happy old way | evarts replied: no choate i fear that cannot be | when i think what a care i am to all my people lying so helpless here and that i can do nothing any more to repay their kindness or to help in the world i feel like the boy who wrote from school to his mother a letter of twenty pages and then added after the end: 'p | s dear mother please excuse my longevity ' | where one has a reputation as a speaker and is also known to oblige friends and to be hardly able to resist importunities the demands upon him are very great | they are also sometimes original and unique | at one time the day before christmas a representative of the new york world came to see me and said: we are going to give a dinner to night to the tramps who gather between ten and eleven o'clock at the vienna restaurant opposite the st denis hotel to receive the bread which the restaurant distributes at that hour | this line was there every night standing in the cold waiting their turn | i went down to the hotel and a young man and young lady connected with the newspaper crossed the street and picked out from the line a hundred guests | it was a remarkable assemblage | the dinner provided was a beautiful and an excellent one for christmas | as i heard their stories there was among them a representative of almost every department of american life | some were temporarily and others permanently down and out | every one of the learned professions was represented and many lines of business | the most of them were in this condition because they had come to new york to make their way and had struggled until their funds were exhausted and then they were ashamed to return home and confess their failure | i presided at this remarkable banquet and made not only one speech but several | by encouraging the guests we had several excellent addresses from preachers without pulpits lawyers without clients doctors without patients engineers without jobs teachers without schools and travellers without funds | one man arose and said: chauncey depew the world has given us such an excellent dinner and you have given us such a merry christmas eve we would like to shake hands with you as we go out | i had long learned the art of shaking hands with the public | many a candidate has had his hands crushed and been permanently hurt by the vise like grip of an ardent admirer or a vicious opponent | i remember general grant complaining of this of how he suffered and i told him of my discovery of grasping the hand first and dropping it quickly | the people about me were looking at these men as they came along to see if there was any possible danger | toward the end of the procession one man said to me: chauncey depew i don't belong to this crowd | i am well enough off and can take care of myself | i am an anarchist | my business is to stir up unrest and discontent and that brings me every night to mingle with the crowd waiting for their dole of bread from fleischmann's bakery | you do more than any one else in the whole country to create good feeling and dispel unrest and you have done a lot of it to night | i made up my mind to kill you right here but you are such an infernal good fellow that i have not the heart to do it so here's my hand | on one occasion i received an invitation to address a sociological society which was to meet at the house of one of the most famous entertainers in new york | my host said that edward atkinson the well known new england writer philosopher and sociologist would address the meeting | when i arrived at the house i found atkinson in despair | the audience were young ladies in full evening dress and young men in white vests white neckties and swallow tails | there was also a band present | we were informed that this society had endeavored to mingle instruction with pleasure and it really was a dancing club but they had conceived the idea of having something serious and instructive before the ball | mr atkinson said to me: what won me to come here is that in boston we have a society of the same name | it is composed of very serious people who are engaged in settlement and sociological work | they are doing their best to improve the conditions of the young women and young men who are in clerical and other employment | i have delivered several addresses before that society and before the audiences which they gather on how to live comfortably and get married on the smallest possible margin | now for instance for my lecture here to night i have on a ready made suit of clothes for which i paid yesterday five dollars | in that large boiler there is a stove which i have invented | in the oven of the stove is beef and various vegetables and to heat it is a kerosene lamp with a clockwork attached | a young man or a young woman or a young married couple go to the market and buy the cheap cuts of beef and then according to my instructions they put it in the stove with the vegetables light the lamp set the clockwork and go to their work | when they return at five six or seven o'clock they find a very excellent and very cheap dinner all ready to be served | now of what use is my five dollar suit of clothes and my fifty cent dinner for this crowd of butterflies | however mr atkinson and i made up our minds to talk to them as if they needed it or would need it some day or other and they were polite enough to ask questions and pretend to enjoy it | i understand that afterwards at the midnight supper there was more champagne and more hilarity than at previous gatherings of this sociological club | during one of our presidential campaigns some young men came up from the bowery to see me | they said: we have a very hard time down in our district | the crowd is a tough one but intelligent and we think would be receptive of the truth if they could hear it put to them in an attractive form | we will engage a large theatre attached to a bowery beer saloon if you will come down and address the meeting | the novelty of your appearance will fill the theatre | i knew there was considerable risk and yet it was a great opportunity | i believe that in meeting a crowd of that sort one should appear as they expect him to look when addressing the best of audiences | these people are very proud and they resent any attempt on your part to be what they know you are not but that you are coming down to their level by assuming a character which you presume to be theirs | so i dressed with unusual care and when i went on the platform a short sleeved short haired genius in the theatre shouted: chauncey thinks he is in carnegie hall | the famous tim sullivan who was several times a state senator and congressman and a mighty good fellow was the leader of the bowery and controlled its political actions | he came to see me and said: i hope you will withdraw from that appointment | i do not want you to come down there | in the first place i cannot protect you and i don't think it is safe | in the second place you are so well known and popular among our people that i am afraid you will produce an impression and if you get away with it that will hurt our machine | in the course of my speech a man arose whom i knew very well as a district leader and who was frequently in my office seeking positions for his constituents and other favors | that night he was in his shirt sleeves among the boys | with the old volunteer fireman's swagger and the peculiar patois of that part of new york he said: chauncey depew you have no business here | you are the president of the new york central railroad ain't you hey | you are a rich man ain't you hey | we are poor boys | you don't know us and can't teach us anything | you had better get out while you can | my reply was this: my friend i want a little talk with you | i began life very much as you did | nobody helped me | i was a country boy and my capital was this head and i slapped it these legs and i slapped them these hands and i slapped them and by using them as best i could i have become just what you say i am and have got where you will never arrive | a shirt sleeved citizen jumped up from the audience and shouted: go ahead chauncey you're a peach | that characterization of a peach went into the newspapers and was attached to me wherever i appeared for many years afterwards not only in this country but abroad | it even found a place in the slang column of the great dictionaries of the english language | the result of the meeting however was a free discussion in the bowery and for the first time in its history that particular district was carried by the republicans | after their triumph in the election i gave a dinner in the union league club to the captains of the election districts | there were about a hundred of them | the district captains were all in their usual business suits and were as sharp keen intelligent and up to date young men as one could wish to meet | the club members whom i had invited to meet my guests were of course in conventional evening dress | the novelty of the occasion was so enjoyed by them that they indulged with more than usual liberality in the fluids and fizz and became very hilarious | not one of the district captains touched a drop of wine | while the club members were a little frightened at the idea of these east siders coming my guests understood and met every convention of the occasion before during and after dinner as if it was an accustomed social function with them | the half dozen who made speeches showed a grasp of the political questions of the hour and an ability to put their views before an audience which was an exhibition of a high order of intelligence and self culture | in selecting a few out of the way occasions which were also most interesting and instructive i recall one with a society which prided itself upon its absence of narrowness and its freedom of thought and discussion | the speakers were most critical of all that is generally accepted and believed | professor john fiske the historian was the most famous man present and very critical of the bible | my good mother had brought me up on the bible and instilled in me the deepest reverence for the good book | the criticism of the professor stirred me to a rejoinder | i of course was in no way equal to meeting him with his vast erudition and scholarly accomplishments | i could only give what the bible critic would regard as valueless a sledge hammer expression of faith | somebody took the speech down | doctor john hall the famous preacher and for many years pastor of the fifth avenue presbyterian church told me that the bible and the church societies in england had put the speech into a leaflet and were distributing many millions of them in the british isles | it is singular what vogue and circulation a story of the hour will receive | usually these decorations of a speech die with the occasion | there was fierce rivalry when it was decided to celebrate the four hundredth anniversary of the landing of columbus in america between new york and chicago as to which should have the exhibition | of course the western orators were not modest in the claims which they made for the city by the lakes | to dampen their ardor i embroidered the following story which took wonderfully when told in my speech | it was at the eagle hotel in peekskill at which it was said george washington stopped many times as a guest during the revolutionary war where in respect to his memory they preserved the traditions of the revolutionary period | at that time the bill of fare was not printed but the waiter announced to the guest what would be served if asked for | a chicago citizen was dining at the hotel | he ordered each of the many items announced to him by the waiter | when he came to the deserts the waiter said: we have mince pie apple pie pumpkin pie and custard pie | the chicago man ordered mince pie apple pie and pumpkin pie | the disgusted waiter remarked: what is the matter with the custard | alongside me sat a very well known english gentleman of high rank who had come to this country on a sort of missionary and evangelistic errand | of course he was as solemn as the task he had undertaken which was to convert american sinners | he turned suddenly to me and in a loud voice asked: what was the matter with the custard pie | the story travelled for years was used for many purposes was often murdered in the narration but managed to survive and was told to me as an original joke by one of the men i met at the convention last june in chicago | after chicago received from congress the appointment i did all i could to help the legislation and appropriations necessary | the result was that when i visited the city as an orator at the opening of the exhibition i was voted the freedom of the city was given a great reception and among other things reviewed the school children who paraded in my honor | the yale alumni of new york city had for many years an organization | in the early days the members met very infrequently at a dinner | this was a formal affair and generally drew a large gathering both of the local alumni and from the college and the country | these meetings were held at delmonico's then located in fourteenth street | the last was so phenomenally dull that there were no repetitions | the speakers were called by classes and the oldest in graduation had the platform | the result was disastrous | these old men all spoke too long and it was an endless stream of platitudes and reminiscences of forgotten days until nearly morning | then an inspiration of the chairman led him to say: i think it might be well to have a word from the younger graduates | there was a unanimous call for a well known humorist named styles | his humor was aided by a startling appearance of abundant red hair an aggressive red mustache and eyes which seemed to push his glasses off his nose | many of the speakers owing to the imperfection of the dental art in those days indicated their false teeth by their trouble in keeping them in place and the whistling it gave to their utterances | one venerable orator in his excitement dropped his into his tumbler in the midst of his address | styles said to this tired audience: at this early hour in the morning i will not attempt to speak but i will tell a story | down at barnegat n j where i live our neighbors are very fond of apple jack | one of them while in town had his jug filled and on the way home saw a friend leaning over the gate and looking so thirsty that he stopped and handed over his jug with an offer of its hospitality | after sampling it the neighbor continued the gurgling as the jug rose higher and higher until there was not a drop left in it | the indignant owner said: 'you infernal hog why did you drink up all my apple jack '| his friend answered: 'i beg your pardon job but i could not bite off the tap because i have lost all my teeth ' | the aptness of the story was the success of the evening | some years afterwards there was a meeting of the alumni to form a live association | among those who participated in the organization were william walter phelps afterwards member of congress and minister to austria judge henry e howland john proctor clarke now chief justice of the appellate division james r sheffield several years later now president of the union league club and isaac bromley one of the editors of the new york tribune one of the wittiest writers of his time and many others who have since won distinction | they elected me president and i continued such by successive elections for ten years | the association met once a month and had a serious paper read speeches a simple supper and a social evening | these monthly gatherings became a feature and were widely reported in the press | we could rely upon one or more of the faculty and there was always to be had an alumnus of national reputation from abroad | we had a formal annual dinner which was more largely attended than almost any function of the kind in the city and because of the variety and excellence of the speaking always very enjoyable | the harvard and princeton alumni also had an association at that time with annual dinners and it was customary for the officers of each of these organizations to be guests of the one which gave the dinner | the presidents of the colleges represented always came | yale could rely upon president dwight harvard upon president eliot and princeton upon president mccosh | of course the interchanges between the representatives of the different colleges were as exciting and aggressive as their football and baseball contests are to day | i recall one occasion of more than usual interest | it was the princeton dinner and the outstanding figure of the occasion was that most successful and impressive of college executives president mccosh | he spoke with a broad scotch accent and was in every sense a literalist | late in the evening mr beaman a very brilliant lawyer and partner of evarts and choate who was president of the harvard alumni association said to me: these proceedings are fearfully prosaic and highbrow | when you are called you attack president mccosh and i will defend him | so in the course of my remarks which were highly complimentary to princeton and its rapid growth under president mccosh i spoke of its remarkable success in receiving gifts and legacies which were then pouring into its treasury every few months and were far beyond anything which came either to yale or harvard though both were in great need | then i hinted that possibly this flow of riches was due to the fact that president mccosh had such an hypnotic influence over the graduates of princeton and their fathers mothers and wives that none of them felt there was a chance of a heavenly future unless princeton was among the heirs | mr beaman was very indignant and with the continuing approval and applause of the venerable doctor made a furious attack upon me | his defense of the president was infinitely worse than my attack | he alleged that i had intimated that the doctor kept tab on sick alumni of wealth and their families and at the critical moment there would be a sympathetic call from the doctor and while at the bedside he administered comfort and consolation yet he made it plain to the patient that he could not hope for the opening of the pearly gates or the welcome of st peter unless princeton was remembered | then beaman in a fine burst of oratory ascribed this wonderful prosperity not to any personal effort or appeal but because the sons of princeton felt such reverence and gratitude for their president that they were only too glad of an opportunity to contribute to the welfare of the institution | the moment beaman sat down the doctor arose and with great intensity expressed his thanks and gratitude to the eloquent president of the harvard alumni and then shouted: i never never never solicited a gift for princeton from a dying man | i never never never sat by the bedside of a dying woman and held up the terrors of hell and the promises of heaven according to the disposition she made of her estate | i never never looked with unsympathetic and eager anticipation whenever any of our wealthy alumni appeared in ill health | the doctor however retaliated subsequently | he invited me to deliver a lecture before the college and entertained me most delightfully at his house | it was a paid admission and when i left in the morning he said: i want to express to you on behalf of our college our thanks | we raised last evening through your lecture enough to fit our ball team for its coming contest with yale | in that contest princeton was triumphant | the yale alumni association subsequently evoluted into the yale club of new york which has in every way been phenomenally prosperous | it is a factor of national importance in supporting yale and keeping alive everywhere appreciation and enthusiasm for and practice of yale spirit | my class of 1856 at yale numbered ninety seven on graduation | only six of us survive | in these pages i have had a continuous class meeting | very few if any of my associates in the new york legislature of 1862 and 1863 are alive and none of the state officers who served with me in the succeeding years | there is no one left in the service who was there when i became connected with the new york central railroad and no executive officer in any railroad in the united states who held that position when i was elected and is still active | it is the habit of age to dwell on the degeneracy of the times and lament the good old days and their superiority but yale is infinitely greater and broader than when i graduated sixty five years ago | the prisoners were poorly clad and had the appearance of harsh usage | our suspicions of ill treatment were strengthened by noticing a large whip in the treadmill and sundry iron collars and handcuffs hanging about in the several rooms through which we passed | i believe in the necessity of leadership and while recognizing a higher general average in public life regret that the world crisis through which we have passed and which is not yet completed has produced no washington lincoln or roosevelt | i rejoice that president harding under the pressure of his unequalled responsibilities is developing the highest qualities of leadership | it is an exquisite delight to visualize each administration from 1856 and to have had considerable intimacy with the leaders in government and the moulders of public opinion during sixty five unusually laborious years | many who have given their reminiscences have kept close continuing diaries | from these voluminous records they have selected according to their judgment | as i have before said i have no data and must rely on my memory | this faculty is not logical its operations are not by years or periods but its films unroll as they are moved by association of ideas and events | it has been a most pleasurable task to bring back into my life these worthies of the past and to live over again events of greater or lesser importance | sometimes an anecdote illumines a character more than a biography and a personal incident helps an understanding of a period more than its formal history | life has had for me immeasurable charms | i recognize at all times there has been granted to me the loving care and guidance of god | my sorrows have been alleviated and lost their acuteness from a firm belief in closer reunion in eternity | my misfortunes disappointments and losses have been met and overcome by abundant proof of my mother's faith and teaching that they were the discipline of providence for my own good and if met in that spirit and with redoubled effort to redeem the apparent tragedy they would prove to be blessings |the saturday morning came at last for which lord fawn had made his appointment with lizzie and a very important day it was in hertford street chiefly on account of his lordship's visit but also in respect to other events which crowded themselves into the day |
