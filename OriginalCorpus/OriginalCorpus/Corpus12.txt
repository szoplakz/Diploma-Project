  dedication et nunc et semper dilectoe dicatum | louis lambert louis lambert was born at montoire a little town in the vendomois where his father owned a tannery of no great magnitude and intended that his son should succeed him but his precocious bent for study modified the paternal decision | for indeed the tanner and his wife adored louis their only child and never contradicted him in anything | at the age of five louis had begun by reading the old and new testaments and these two books including so many books had sealed his fate | could that childish imagination understand the mystical depths of the scriptures | could it so early follow the flight of the holy spirit across the worlds | or was it merely attracted by the romantic touches which abound in those oriental poems | our narrative will answer these questions to some readers | one thing resulted from this first reading of the bible: louis went all over montoire begging for books and he obtained them by those winning ways peculiar to children which no one can resist | while devoting himself to these studies under no sort of guidance he reached the age of ten | at that period substitutes for the army were scarce rich families secured them long beforehand to have them ready when the lots were drawn | the poor tanner's modest fortune did not allow of their purchasing a substitute for their son and they saw no means allowed by law for evading the conscription but that of making him a priest so in 1807 they sent him to his maternal uncle the parish priest of mer another small town on the loire not far from blois | this arrangement at once satisfied louis' passion for knowledge and his parents' wish not to expose him to the dreadful chances of war and indeed his taste for study and precocious intelligence gave grounds for hoping that he might rise to high fortunes in the church | after remaining for about three years with his uncle an old and not uncultured oratorian louis left him early in 1811 to enter the college at vendome where he was maintained at the cost of madame de stael | lambert owed the favor and patronage of this celebrated lady to chance or shall we not say to providence who can smooth the path of forlorn genius | to us indeed who do not see below the surface of human things such vicissitudes of which we find many examples in the lives of great men appear to be merely the result of physical phenomena to most biographers the head of a man of genius rises above the herd as some noble plant in the fields attracts the eye of a botanist in its splendor | this comparison may well be applied to louis lambert's adventure he was accustomed to spend the time allowed him by his uncle for holidays at his father's house but instead of indulging after the manner of schoolboys in the sweets of the delightful far niente that tempts us at every age he set out every morning with part of a loaf and his books and went to read and meditate in the woods to escape his mother's remonstrances for she believed such persistent study to be injurious | how admirable is a mother's instinct | from that time reading was in louis a sort of appetite which nothing could satisfy he devoured books of every kind feeding indiscriminately on religious works history philosophy and physics | he has told me that he found indescribable delight in reading dictionaries for lack of other books and i readily believed him | what scholar has not many a time found pleasure in seeking the probable meaning of some unknown word | the analysis of a word its physiognomy and history would be to lambert matter for long dreaming | but these were not the instinctive dreams by which a boy accustoms himself to the phenomena of life steels himself to every moral or physical perception an involuntary education which subsequently brings forth fruit both in the understanding and character of a man no louis mastered the facts and he accounted for them after seeking out both the principle and the end with the mother wit of a savage | indeed from the age of fourteen by one of those startling freaks in which nature sometimes indulges and which proved how anomalous was his temperament he would utter quite simply ideas of which the depth was not revealed to me till a long time after |  often he has said to me when speaking of his studies often have i made the most delightful voyage floating on a word down the abyss of the past like an insect embarked on a blade of grass tossing on the ripples of a stream | starting from greece i would get to rome and traverse the whole extent of modern ages | what a fine book might be written of the life and adventures of a word | it has of course received various stamps from the occasions on which it has served its purpose it has conveyed different ideas in different places but is it not still grander to think of it under the three aspects of soul body and motion | merely to regard it in the abstract apart from its functions its effects and its influence is enough to cast one into an ocean of meditations | are not most words colored by the idea they represent | then to whose genius are they due | if it takes great intelligence to create a word how old may human speech be | the combination of letters their shapes and the look they give to the word are the exact reflection in accordance with the character of each nation of the unknown beings whose traces survive in us |  who can philosophically explain the transition from sensation to thought from thought to word from the word to its hieroglyphic presentment from hieroglyphics to the alphabet from the alphabet to written language of which the eloquent beauty resides in a series of images classified by rhetoric and forming in a sense the hieroglyphics of thought | was it not the ancient mode of representing human ideas as embodied in the forms of animals that gave rise to the shapes of the first signs used in the east for writing down language | then has it not left its traces by tradition on our modern languages which have all seized some remnant of the primitive speech of nations a majestic and solemn tongue whose grandeur and solemnity decrease as communities grow old whose sonorous tones ring in the hebrew bible and still are noble in greece but grow weaker under the progress of successive phases of civilization |  is it to this time honored spirit that we owe the mysteries lying buried in every human word | in the word true do we not discern a certain imaginary rectitude | does not the compact brevity of its sound suggest a vague image of chaste nudity and the simplicity of truth in all things | the syllable seems to me singularly crisp and fresh |  i chose the formula of an abstract idea on purpose not wishing to illustrate the case by a word which should make it too obvious to the apprehension as the word flight for instance which is a direct appeal to the senses | your majesty's friend and younger brother c sar | the letter has a wafer bearing the combined arms of c sar with the inscription c sar borgia de francia dux romandiol | one shield has the borgia arms with the french lilies and a helmet from which seven snarling dragons issue the other the arms of c sar's wife with the lilies of france and a winged horse rising from the casque | c sar's secretary reached ferrara the last day of december | this same federigo had been in that city once before during july of the year 1506 and had been sent back to spain by the duchess |  210 he now returned to italy not for the purpose of bringing the news of his master's escape but to learn how matters stood and to ascertain whether there was any prospect of restoring the duke of romagna | his majordomo requesenz who was in ferrara in january had come for the same purpose | no time however could have been less favorable for such schemes than the year 1506 for julius ii had just taken possession of bologna | the marchese gonzaga upon whose good will c sar still reckoned was commander of the papal army which it was believed was planning an expedition into the romagna | this was the only country where there was the slightest possibility of c sar's succeeding in reacquiring his power for his good government had left a favorable impression on the romagnoles who would have preferred his authority to that of the church | zurita the historian of aragon is correct when he says: c sar's escape caused the pope great anxiety for the duke was a man who would not have hesitated to throw all italy in turmoil for the purpose of carrying out his own plans he was greatly beloved not only by the men of war but also by many people in ferrara and in the states of the church something which seldom falls to the lot of a tyrant | c sar's messenger ventured to bologna in spite of the presence of the pope and there the latter had him seized | this was reported to lucretia who immediately wrote to the marchese of gonzaga as follows: illustrious brother in law and honored brother: i have just learned that by command of his holiness our federigo the chancellor of the duke my brother has been seized in bologna i am sure he has done nothing to deserve this for he did not come here with the intention of doing or saying anything that would displease or injure his holiness his excellency would not countenance or risk anything of this sort against his holiness | his brain accustomed in early youth to the mysterious mechanism by which human faculties are concentrated drew from this rich treasury endless images full of life and freshness on which he fed his spirit during those lucid spells of contemplation |  whenever i wish it said he to me in his own language to which a fund of remembrance gave precocious originality i can draw a veil over my eyes | then i suddenly see within me a camera obscura where natural objects are reproduced in purer forms than those under which they first appeared to my external sense | at the age of twelve his imagination stimulated by the perpetual exercise of his faculties had developed to a point which permitted him to have such precise concepts of things which he knew only from reading about them that the image stamped on his mind could not have been clearer if he had actually seen them whether this was by a process of analogy or that he was gifted with a sort of second sight by which he could command all nature |  when i read the story of the battle of austerlitz said he to me one day i saw every incident | the roar of the cannon the cries of the fighting men rang in my ears and made my inmost self quiver i could smell the powder i heard the clatter of horses and the voices of men i looked down on the plain where armed nations were in collision just as if i had been on the heights of santon | the scene was as terrifying as a passage from the apocalypse | on the occasions when he brought all his powers into play and in some degree lost consciousness of his physical existence and lived on only by the remarkable energy of his mental powers whose sphere was enormously expanded he left space behind him to use his own words | but i will not here anticipate the intellectual phases of his life | already in spite of myself i have reversed the order in which i ought to tell the history of this man who transferred all his activities to thinking as others throw all their life into action | a strong bias drew his mind into mystical studies |  abyssus abyssum he would say |  our spirit is abysmal and loves the abyss | in childhood manhood and old age we are always eager for mysteries in whatever form they present themselves | this predilection was disastrous if indeed his life can be measured by ordinary standards or if we may gauge another's happiness by our own or by social notions | this taste for the things of heaven another phrase he was fond of using this mens divinior was due perhaps to the influence produced on his mind by the first books he read at his uncle's | saint theresa and madame guyon were a sequel to the bible they had the first fruits of his manly intelligence and accustomed him to those swift reactions of the soul of which ecstasy is at once the result and the means | this line of study this peculiar taste elevated his heart purified ennobled it gave him an appetite for the divine nature and suggested to him the almost womanly refinement of feeling which is instinctive in great men perhaps their sublime superiority is no more than the desire to devote themselves which characterizes woman only transferred to the greatest things | as a result of these early impressions louis passed immaculate through his school life this beautiful virginity of the senses naturally resulted in the richer fervor of his blood and in increased faculties of mind | the baroness de stael forbidden to come within forty leagues of paris spent several months of her banishment on an estate near vendome | one day when out walking she met on the skirts of the park the tanner's son almost in rags and absorbed in reading | the book was a translation of heaven and hell | at that time monsieur saint martin monsieur de gence and a few other french or half german writers were almost the only persons in the french empire to whom the name of swedenborg was known | madame de stael greatly surprised took the book from him with the roughness she affected in her questions looks and manners and with a keen glance at lambert do you understand all this | she asked |  do you pray to god | said the child | why yes   and do you understand him | the baroness was silent for a moment then she sat down by lambert and began to talk to him | unfortunately my memory though retentive is far from being so trustworthy as my friend's and i have forgotten the whole of the dialogue excepting those first words | such a meeting was of a kind to strike madame de stael very greatly on her return home she said but little about it notwithstanding an effusiveness which in her became mere loquacity but it evidently occupied her thoughts | the only person now living who preserves any recollection of the incident and whom i catechised to be informed of what few words madame de stael had let drop could with difficulty recall these words spoken by the baroness as describing lambert he is a real seer | louis failed to justify in the eyes of the world the high hopes he had inspired in his protectress | the transient favor she showed him was regarded as a feminine caprice one of the fancies characteristic of artist souls | madame de stael determined to save louis lambert alike from serving the emperor or the church and to preserve him for the glorious destiny which she thought awaited him for she made him out to be a second moses snatched from the waters | before her departure she instructed a friend of hers monsieur de corbigny to send her moses in due course to the high school at vendome then she probably forgot him | having entered this college at the age of fourteen early in 1811 lambert would leave it at the end of 1814 when he had finished the course of philosophy | i doubt whether during the whole time he ever heard a word of his benefactress if indeed it was the act of a benefactress to pay for a lad's schooling for three years without a thought of his future prospects after diverting him from a career in which he might have found happiness | the circumstances of the time and louis lambert's character may to a great extent absolve madame de stael for her thoughtlessness and her generosity | the gentleman who was to have kept up communications between her and the boy left blois just at the time when louis passed out of the college | the political events that ensued were then a sufficient excuse for this gentleman's neglect of the baroness' protege | the authoress of corinne heard no more of her little moses | a hundred louis which she placed in the hands of monsieur de corbigny who died i believe in 1812 was not a sufficiently large sum to leave lasting memories in madame de stael whose excitable nature found ample pasture during the vicissitudes of 1814 and 1815 which absorbed all her interest | at this time louis lambert was at once too proud and too poor to go in search of a patroness who was traveling all over europe | however he went on foot from blois to paris in the hope of seeing her and arrived unluckily on the very day of her death | two letters from lambert to the baroness remained unanswered | the memory of madame de stael's good intentions with regard to louis remains therefore only in some few young minds struck as mine was by the strangeness of the story | no one who had not gone through the training at our college could understand the effect usually made on our minds by the announcement that a new boy had arrived or the impression that such an adventure as louis lambert's was calculated to produce | and here a little information must be given as to the primitive administration of this institution originally half military and half monastic to explain the new life which there awaited lambert | before the revolution the oratorians devoted like the society of jesus to the education of youth succeeding the jesuits in fact in certain of their establishments the colleges of vendome of tournon of la fleche pont levoy sorreze and juilly | that at vendome like the others i believe turned out a certain number of cadets for the army | the abolition of educational bodies decreed by the convention had but little effect on the college at vendome | when the first crisis had blown over the authorities recovered possession of their buildings certain oratorians scattered about the country came back to the college and re opened it under the old rules with the habits practices and customs which gave this school a character with which i have seen nothing at all comparable in any that i have visited since i left that establishment | standing in the heart of the town on the little river loire which flows under its walls the college possesses extensive precincts carefully enclosed by walls and including all the buildings necessary for an institution on that scale: a chapel a theatre an infirmary a bakehouse gardens and water supply | this college is the most celebrated home of learning in all the central provinces and receives pupils from them and from the colonies | distance prohibits any frequent visits from parents to their children | the rule of the house forbids holidays away from it | once entered there a pupil never leaves till his studies are finished | with the exception of walks taken under the guidance of the fathers everything is calculated to give the school the benefit of conventual discipline in my day the tawse was still a living memory and the classical leather strap played its terrible part with all the honors | the punishment originally invented by the society of jesus as alarming to the moral as to the physical man was still in force in all the integrity of the original code | letters to parents were obligatory on certain days so was confession | thus our sins and our sentiments were all according to pattern | everything bore the stamp of monastic rule | i well remember among other relics of the ancient order the inspection we went through every sunday | we were all in our best placed in file like soldiers to await the arrival of the two inspectors who attended by the tutors and the tradesmen examined us from the three points of view of dress health and morals | the two or three hundred pupils lodged in the establishment were divided according to ancient custom into the minimes the smallest the little boys the middle boys and the big boys | the division of the minimes included the eighth and seventh classes the little boys formed the sixth fifth and fourth the middle boys were classed as third and second and the first class comprised the senior students of philosophy rhetoric the higher mathematics and chemistry | each of these divisions had its own building classrooms and play ground in the large common precincts on to which the classrooms opened and beyond which was the refectory | this dining hall worthy of an ancient religious order accommodated all the school | contrary to the usual practice in educational institutions we were allowed to talk at our meals a tolerant oratorian rule which enabled us to exchange plates according to our taste | this gastronomical barter was always one of the chief pleasures of our college life | if one of the middle boys at the head of his table wished for a helping of lentils instead of dessert for we had dessert the offer was passed down from one to another: dessert for lentils | till some other epicure had accepted then the plate of lentils was passed up to the bidder from hand to hand and the plate of dessert returned by the same road | mistakes were never made | if several identical offers were made they were taken in order and the formula would be lentils number one for dessert number one | the tables were very long our incessant barter kept everything moving we transacted it with amazing eagerness and the chatter of three hundred lads the bustling to and fro of the servants employed in changing the plates setting down the dishes handing the bread with the tours of inspection of the masters made this refectory at vendome a scene unique in its way and the amazement of visitors | to make our life more tolerable deprived as we were of all communication with the outer world and of family affection we were allowed to keep pigeons and to have gardens | our two or three hundred pigeon houses with a thousand birds nesting all round the outer wall and above thirty garden plots were a sight even stranger than our meals | but a full account of the peculiarities which made the college at vendome a place unique in itself and fertile in reminiscences to those who spent their boyhood there would be weariness to the reader | which of us all but remembers with delight notwithstanding the bitterness of learning the eccentric pleasures of that cloistered life | the sweetmeats purchased by stealth in the course of our walks permission obtained to play cards and devise theatrical performances during the holidays such tricks and freedom as were necessitated by our seclusion then again our military band a relic of the cadets our academy our chaplain our father professors and all our games permitted or prohibited as the case might be the cavalry charges on stilts the long slides made in winter the clatter of our clogs and above all the trading transactions with the shop set up in the courtyard itself | this shop was kept by a sort of cheap jack of whom big and little boys could procure according to his prospectus boxes stilts tools jacobin pigeons and nuns mass books an article in small demand penknives paper pens pencils ink of all colors balls and marbles in short the whole catalogue of the most treasured possessions of boys including everything from sauce for the pigeons we were obliged to kill off to the earthenware pots in which we set aside the rice from supper to be eaten at next morning's breakfast | which of us was so unhappy as to have forgotten how his heart beat at the sight of this booth open periodically during play hours on sundays to which we went each in his turn to spend his little pocket money while the smallness of the sum allowed by our parents for these minor pleasures required us to make a choice among all the objects that appealed so strongly to our desires | did ever a young wife to whom her husband during the first days of happiness hands twelve times a year a purse of gold the budget of her personal fancies dream of so many different purchases each of which would absorb the whole sum as we imagined possible on the eve of the first sunday in each month | for six francs during one night we owned every delight of that inexhaustible shop | and during mass every response we chanted was mixed up in our minds with our secret calculations | which of us all can recollect ever having had a sou left to spend on the sunday following | and which of us but obeyed the instinctive law of social existence by pitying helping and despising those pariahs who by the avarice or poverty of their parents found themselves penniless | any one who forms a clear idea of this huge college with its monastic buildings in the heart of a little town and the four plots in which we were distributed as by a monastic rule will easily conceive of the excitement that we felt at the arrival of a new boy a passenger suddenly embarked on the ship | no young duchess on her first appearance at court was ever more spitefully criticised than the new boy by the youths in his division | usually during the evening play hour before prayers those sycophants who were accustomed to ingratiate themselves with the fathers who took it in turns two and two for a week to keep an eye on us would be the first to hear on trustworthy authority: there will be a new boy to morrow | and then suddenly the shout a new boy a new boy | rang through the courts | we hurried up to crowd round the superintendent and pester him with questions: where was he coming from | what was his name | which class would he be in | and so forth | louis lambert's advent was the subject of a romance worthy of the arabian nights | i was in the fourth class at the time among the little boys | our housemasters were two men whom we called fathers from habit and tradition though they were not priests | in my time there were indeed but three genuine oratorians to whom this title legitimately belonged in 1814 they all left the college which had gradually become secularized to find occupation about the altar in various country parishes like the cure of mer | father haugoult the master for the week was not a bad man but of very moderate attainments and he lacked the tact which is indispensable for discerning the different characters of children and graduating their punishment to their powers of resistance | father haugoult then began very obligingly to communicate to his pupils the wonderful events which were to end on the morrow in the advent of the most singular of new boys | games were at an end | all the children came round in silence to hear the story of louis lambert discovered like an aerolite by madame de stael in a corner of the wood | monsieur haugoult had to tell us all about madame de stael that evening she seemed to me ten feet high i saw at a later time the picture of corinne in which gerard represents her as so tall and handsome and alas | the woman painted by my imagination so far transcended this that the real madame de stael fell at once in my estimation even after i read her book of really masculine power de l'allemagne | but lambert at that time was an even greater wonder | monsieur mareschal the headmaster after examining him had thought of placing him among the senior boys | it was louis' ignorance of latin that placed him so low as the fourth class but he would certainly leap up a class every year and as a remarkable exception he was to be one of the academy | proh pudor | we were to have the honor of counting among the little boys one whose coat was adorned with the red ribbon displayed by the academicians of vendome | these academicians enjoyed distinguished privileges they often dined at the director's table and held two literary meetings annually at which we were all present to hear their elucubrations | an academician was a great man in embryo | and if every vendome scholar would speak the truth he would confess that in later life an academician of the great french academy seemed to him far less remarkable than the stupendous boy who wore the cross and the imposing red ribbon which were the insignia of our academy | it was very unusual to be one of that illustrious body before attaining to the second class for the academicians were expected to hold public meetings every thursday during the holidays and to read tales in verse or prose epistles essays tragedies dramas compositions far above the intelligence of the lower classes | i long treasured the memory of a story called the green ass which was i think the masterpiece of this unknown society | in the fourth and an academician | this boy of fourteen a poet already the protege of madame de stael a coming genius said father haugoult was to be one of us | a wizard a youth capable of writing a composition or a translation while we were being called into lessons and of learning his lessons by reading them through but once | louis lambert bewildered all our ideas | and father haugoult's curiosity and impatience to see this new boy added fuel to our excited fancy |  if he has pigeons he can have no pigeon house there is not room for another | well it cannot be helped said one boy since famous as an agriculturist |  who will sit next to him | said another |  oh i wish i might be his chum | cried an enthusiast | in school language the word here rendered chum faisant or in some schools copin expressed a fraternal sharing of the joys and evils of your childish existence a community of interests that was fruitful of squabbling and making friends again a treaty of alliance offensive and defensive | it is strange but never in my time did i know brothers who were chums | if man lives by his feelings he thinks perhaps that he will make his life the poorer if he merges an affection of his own choosing in a natural tie | the impression made upon me by father haugoult's harangue that evening is one of the most vivid reminiscences of my childhood i can compare it with nothing but my first reading of robinson crusoe | indeed i owe to my recollection of these prodigious impressions an observation that may perhaps be new as to the different sense attached to words by each hearer | the word in itself has no final meaning we affect a word more than it affects us its value is in relation to the images we have assimilated and grouped round it but a study of this fact would require considerable elaboration and lead us too far from our immediate subject | not being able to sleep i had a long discussion with my next neighbor in the dormitory as to the remarkable being who on the morrow was to be one of us | this neighbor who became an officer and is now a writer with lofty philosophical views barchou de penhoen has not been false to his pre destination nor to the hazard of fortune by which the only two scholars of vendome of whose fame vendome ever hears were brought together in the same classroom on the same form and under the same roof | our comrade dufaure had not when this book was published made his appearance in public life as a lawyer | the translator of fichte the expositor and friend of ballanche was already interested as i myself was in metaphysical questions we often talked nonsense together about god ourselves and nature | he at that time affected pyrrhonism | jealous of his place as leader he doubted lambert's precocious gifts while i having lately read les enfants celebres overwhelmed him with evidence quoting young montcalm pico della mirandola pascal in short a score of early developed brains anomalies that are famous in the history of the human mind and lambert's predecessors | i was at the time passionately addicted to reading | my father who was ambitious to see me in the ecole polytechnique paid for me to have a special course of private lessons in mathematics | my mathematical master was the librarian of the college and allowed me to help myself to books without much caring what i chose to take from the library a quiet spot where i went to him during play hours to have my lesson | either he was no great mathematician or he was absorbed in some grand scheme for he very willingly left me to read when i ought to have been learning while he worked at i knew not what | so by a tacit understanding between us i made no complaints of being taught nothing and he said nothing of the books i borrowed | carried away by this ill timed mania i neglected my studies to compose poems which certainly can have shown no great promise to judge by a line of too many feet which became famous among my companions the beginning of an epic on the incas: o inca | o roi infortune et malheureux | in derision of such attempts i was nicknamed the poet but mockery did not cure me | i was always rhyming in spite of good advice from monsieur mareschal the headmaster who tried to cure me of an unfortunately inveterate passion by telling me the fable of a linnet that fell out of the nest because it tried to fly before its wings were grown | i persisted in my reading i became the least emulous the idlest the most dreamy of all the division of little boys and consequently the most frequently punished | this autobiographical digression may give some idea of the reflections i was led to make in anticipation of lambert's arrival | i was then twelve years old | i felt sympathy from the first for the boy whose temperament had some points of likeness to my own | i was at last to have a companion in daydreams and meditations | though i knew not yet what glory meant i thought it glory to be the familiar friend of a child whose immortality was foreseen by madame de stael | to me louis lambert was as a giant | the looked for morrow came at last | a minute before breakfast we heard the steps of monsieur mareschal and of the new boy in the quiet courtyard | every head was turned at once to the door of the classroom | father haugoult who participated in our torments of curiosity did not sound the whistle he used to reduce our mutterings to silence and bring us back to our tasks | we then saw this famous new boy whom monsieur mareschal was leading by the hand | the superintendent descended from his desk and the headmaster said to him solemnly according to etiquette: monsieur i have brought you monsieur louis lambert will you place him in the fourth class | he will begin work to morrow | then after speaking a few words in an undertone to the class master he said: where can he sit | it would have been unfair to displace one of us for a newcomer so as there was but one desk vacant louis lambert came to fill it next to me for i had last joined the class | though we still had some time to wait before lessons were over we all stood up to look at louis lambert | monsieur mareschal heard our mutterings saw how eager we were and said with the kindness that endeared him to us all: well well but make no noise do not disturb the other classes | these words set us free to play some little time before breakfast and we all gathered round lambert while monsieur mareschal walked up and down the courtyard with father haugoult | there were about eighty of us little demons as bold as birds of prey | though we ourselves had all gone through this cruel novitiate we showed no mercy on a newcomer never sparing him the mockery the catechism the impertinence which were inexhaustible on such occasions to the discomfiture of the neophyte whose manners strength and temper were thus tested | lambert whether he was stoical or dumfounded made no reply to any questions | one of us thereupon remarked that he was no doubt of the school of pythagoras and there was a shout of laughter | the new boy was thenceforth pythagoras through all his life at the college | at the same time lambert's piercing eye the scorn expressed in his face for our childishness so far removed from the stamp of his own nature the easy attitude he assumed and his evident strength in proportion to his years infused a certain respect into the veriest scamps among us | for my part i kept near him absorbed in studying him in silence | louis lambert was slightly built nearly five feet in height his face was tanned and his hands were burnt brown by the sun giving him an appearance of manly vigor which in fact he did not possess | indeed two months after he came to the college when studying in the classroom had faded his vivid so to speak vegetable coloring he became as pale and white as a woman | his head was unusually large | his hair of a fine bright black in masses of curls gave wonderful beauty to his brow of which the proportions were extraordinary even to us heedless boys knowing nothing as may be supposed of the auguries of phrenology a science still in its cradle | the distinction of this prophetic brow lay principally in the exquisitely chiseled shape of the arches under which his black eyes sparkled and which had the transparency of alabaster the line having the unusual beauty of being perfectly level to where it met the top of the nose | but when you saw his eyes it was difficult to think of the rest of his face which was indeed plain enough for their look was full of a wonderful variety of expression they seemed to have a soul in their depths | at one moment astonishingly clear and piercing at another full of heavenly sweetness those eyes became dull almost colorless as it seemed when he was lost in meditation | they then looked like a window from which the sun had suddenly vanished after lighting it up | his strength and his voice were no less variable equally rigid equally unexpected | his tone could be as sweet as that of a woman compelled to own her love at other times it was labored rough rugged if i may use such words in a new sense | as to his strength he was habitually incapable of enduring the fatigue of any game and seemed weakly almost infirm | but during the early days of his school life one of our little bullies having made game of this sickliness which rendered him unfit for the violent exercise in vogue among his fellows lambert took hold with both hands of one of the class tables consisting of twelve large desks face to face and sloping from the middle he leaned back against the class master's desk steadying the table with his feet on the cross bar below and said: now ten of you try to move it | i was present and can vouch for this strange display of strength it was impossible to move the table | lambert had the gift of summoning to his aid at certain times the most extraordinary powers and of concentrating all his forces on a given point | but children like men are wont to judge of everything by first impressions and after the first few days we ceased to study louis he entirely belied madame de stael's prognostications and displayed none of the prodigies we looked for in him | after three months at school louis was looked upon as a quite ordinary scholar | i alone was allowed really to know that sublime why should i not say divine soul for what is nearer to god than genius in the heart of a child | the similarity of our tastes and ideas made us friends and chums our intimacy was so brotherly that our school fellows joined our two names one was never spoken without the other and to call either they always shouted poet and pythagoras | some other names had been known coupled in a like manner | thus for two years i was the school friend of poor louis lambert and during that time my life was so identified with his that i am enabled now to write his intellectual biography | it was long before i fully knew the poetry and the wealth of ideas that lay hidden in my companion's heart and brain | it was not till i was thirty years of age till my experience was matured and condensed till the flash of an intense illumination had thrown a fresh light upon it that i was capable of understanding all the bearings of the phenomena which i witnessed at that early time | i benefited by them without understanding their greatness or their processes indeed i have forgotten some or remember only the most conspicuous facts still my memory is now able to co ordinate them and i have mastered the secrets of that fertile brain by looking back to the delightful days of our boyish affection | so it was time alone that initiated me into the meaning of the events and facts that were crowded into that obscure life as into that of many another man who is lost to science | indeed this narrative so far as the expression and appreciation of many things is concerned will be found full of what may be termed moral anachronisms which perhaps will not detract from its peculiar interest | in the course of the first few months after coming to vendome louis became the victim of a malady which though the symptoms were invisible to the eye of our superiors considerably interfered with the exercise of his remarkable gifts | accustomed to live in the open air and to the freedom of a purely haphazard education happy in the tender care of an old man who was devoted to him used to meditating in the sunshine he found it very hard to submit to college rules to walk in the ranks to live within the four walls of a room where eighty boys were sitting in silence on wooden forms each in front of his desk | his senses were developed to such perfection as gave them the most sensitive keenness and every part of him suffered from this life in common | the effluvia that vitiated the air mingled with the odors of a classroom that was never clean nor free from the fragments of our breakfasts or snacks affected his sense of smell the sense which being more immediately connected than the others with the nerve centers of the brain must when shocked cause invisible disturbance to the organs of thought | besides these elements of impurity in the atmosphere there were lockers in the classrooms in which the boys kept their miscellaneous plunder pigeons killed for fete days or tidbits filched from the dinner table | in each classroom too there was a large stone slab on which two pails full of water were kept standing a sort of sink where we every morning washed our faces and hands one after another in the master's presence | we then passed on to a table where women combed and powdered our hair | thus the place being cleaned but once a day before we were up was always more or less dirty | in spite of numerous windows and lofty doors the air was constantly fouled by the smells from the washing place the hairdressing the lockers and the thousand messes made by the boys to say nothing of their eighty closely packed bodies | and this sort of humus mingling with the mud we brought in from the playing yard produced a suffocatingly pestilent muck heap | the loss of the fresh and fragrant country air in which he had hitherto lived the change of habits and strict discipline combined to depress lambert | with his elbow on his desk and his head supported on his left hand he spent the hours of study gazing at the trees in the court or the clouds in the sky he seemed to be thinking of his lessons but the master seeing his pen motionless or the sheet before him still a blank would call out: lambert you are doing nothing | this you are doing nothing | was a pin thrust that wounded louis to the quick | and then he never earned the rest of the play time he always had impositions to write | the imposition a punishment which varies according to the practice of different schools consisted at vendome of a certain number of lines to be written out in play hours | lambert and i were so overpowered with impositions that we had not six free days during the two years of our school friendship | but for the books we took out of the library which maintained some vitality in our brains this system of discipline would have reduced us to idiotcy | want of exercise is fatal to children | the habit of preserving a dignified appearance begun in tender infancy has it is said a visible effect on the constitution of royal personages when the faults of such an education are not counteracted by the life of the battle field or the laborious sport of hunting | and if the laws of etiquette and court manners can act on the spinal marrow to such an extent as to affect the pelvis of kings to soften their cerebral tissue and so degenerate the race what deep seated mischief physical and moral must result in schoolboys from the constant lack of air exercise and cheerfulness | indeed the rules of punishment carried out in schools deserve the attention of the office of public instruction when any thinkers are to be found there who do not think exclusively of themselves | we incurred the infliction of an imposition in a thousand ways | our memory was so good that we never learned a lesson | it was enough for either of us to hear our class fellows repeat the task in french latin or grammar and we could say it when our turn came but if the master unfortunately took it into his head to reverse the usual order and call upon us first we very often did not even know what the lesson was then the imposition fell in spite of our most ingenious excuses | then we always put off writing our exercises till the last moment if there were a book to be finished or if we were lost in thought the task was forgotten again an imposition | how often have we scribbled an exercise during the time when the head boy whose business it was to collect them when we came into school was gathering them from the others | in addition to the moral misery which lambert went through in trying to acclimatize himself to college life there was a scarcely less cruel apprenticeship through which every boy had to pass: to those bodily sufferings which seemed infinitely varied | the tenderness of a child's skin needs extreme care especially in winter when a school boy is constantly exchanging the frozen air of the muddy playing yard for the stuffy atmosphere of the classroom | the little boys and the smallest of all for lack of a mother's care were martyrs to chilblains and chaps so severe that they had to be regularly dressed during the breakfast hour but this could only be very indifferently done to so many damaged hands toes and heels | a good many of the boys indeed were obliged to prefer the evil to the remedy the choice constantly lay between their lessons waiting to be finished or the joys of a slide and waiting for a bandage carelessly put on and still more carelessly cast off again | also it was the fashion in the school to gibe at the poor feeble creatures who went to be doctored the bullies vied with each other in snatching off the rags which the infirmary nurse had tied on | hence in winter many of us with half dead feet and fingers sick with pain were incapable of work and punished for not working | the fathers too often deluded by shammed ailments would not believe in real suffering | the price paid for our schooling and board also covered the cost of clothing | the committee contracted for the shoes and clothes supplied to the boys hence the weekly inspection of which i have spoken | this plan though admirable for the manager is always disastrous to the managed | woe to the boy who indulged in the bad habit of treading his shoes down at heel of cracking the shoe leather or wearing out the soles too fast whether from a defect in his gait or by fidgeting during lessons in obedience to the instinctive need of movement common to all children | that boy did not get through the winter without great suffering | in the first place his chilblains would ache and shot as badly as a fit of the gout then the rivets and pack thread intended to repair the shoes would give way or the broken heels would prevent the wretched shoes from keeping on his feet he was obliged to drag them wearily along the frozen roads or sometimes to dispute their possession with the clay soil of the district the water and snow got in through some unnoticed crack or ill sewn patch and the foot would swell | out of sixty boys not ten perhaps could walk without some special form of torture and yet they all kept up with the body of the troop dragged on by the general movement as men are driven through life by life itself | many a time some proud tempered boy would shed tears of rage while summoning his remaining energy to run ahead and get home again in spite of pain so sensitively afraid of laughter or of pity two forms of scorn is the still tender soul at that age | at school as in social life the strong despise the feeble without knowing in what true strength consists | nor was this all | no gloves | if by good hap a boy's parents the infirmary nurse or the headmaster gave gloves to a particularly delicate lad the wags or the big boys of the class would put them on the stove amused to see them dry and shrivel or if the gloves escaped the marauders after getting wet they shrunk as they dried for want of care | no gloves were impossible | gloves were a privilege and boys insist on equality | louis lambert fell a victim to all these varieties of torment | like many contemplative men who when lost in thought acquire a habit of mechanical motion he had a mania for fidgeting with his shoes and destroyed them very quickly | his girlish complexion the skin of his ears and lips cracked with the least cold | his soft white hands grew red and swollen | he had perpetual colds | thus he was a constant sufferer till he became inured to school life | taught at last by cruel experience he was obliged to look after his things to use the school phrase | he was forced to take care of his locker his desk his clothes his shoes to protect his ink his books his copy paper and his pens from pilferers in short to give his mind to the thousand details of our trivial life to which more selfish and commonplace minds devoted such strict attention thus infallibly securing prizes for proficiency and good conduct while they were overlooked by a boy of the highest promise who under the hand of an almost divine imagination gave himself up with rapture to the flow of his ideas | this was not all | there is a perpetual struggle going on between the masters and the boys a struggle without truce to be compared with nothing else in the social world unless it be the resistance of the opposition to the ministry in a representative government | but journalists and opposition speakers are probably less prompt to take advantage of a weak point less extreme in resenting an injury and less merciless in their mockery than boys are in regard to those who rule over them | it is a task to put angels out of patience | an unhappy class master must then not be too severely blamed ill paid as he is and consequently not too competent if he is occasionally unjust or out of temper | perpetually watched by a hundred mocking eyes and surrounded with snares he sometimes revenges himself for his own blunders on the boys who are only too ready to detect them | unless for serious misdemeanors for which there were other forms of punishment the strap was regarded at vendome as the ultima ratio patrum | exercises forgotten lessons ill learned common ill behavior were sufficiently punished by an imposition but offended dignity spoke in the master through the strap | of all the physical torments to which we were exposed certainly the most acute was that inflicted by this leathern instrument about two fingers wide applied to our poor little hands with all the strength and all the fury of the administrator | to endure this classical form of correction the victim knelt in the middle of the room | he had to leave his form and go to kneel down near the master's desk under the curious and generally merciless eyes of his fellows | to sensitive natures these preliminaries were an introductory torture like the journey from the palais de justice to the place de greve which the condemned used to make to the scaffold | some boys cried out and shed bitter tears before or after the application of the strap others accepted the infliction with stoic calm it was a question of nature but few could control an expression of anguish in anticipation | louis lambert was constantly enduring the strap and owed it to a peculiarity of his physiognomy of which he was for a long time quite unconscious | whenever he was suddenly roused from a fit of abstraction by the master's cry you are doing nothing | it often happened that without knowing it he flashed at his teacher a look full of fierce contempt and charged with thought as a leyden jar is charged with electricity | this look no doubt discomfited the master who indignant at this unspoken retort wished to cure his scholar of that thunderous flash | the first time the father took offence at this ray of scorn which struck him like a lightning flash he made this speech as i well remember: if you look at me again in that way lambert you will get the strap | at these words every nose was in the air every eye looked alternately at the master and at louis | the observation was so utterly foolish that the boy again looked at the father overwhelming him with another flash | from this arose a standing feud between lambert and his master resulting in a certain amount of strap | thus did he first discover the power of his eye | the hapless poet so full of nerves as sensitive as a woman under the sway of chronic melancholy and as sick with genius as a girl with love that she pines for knowing nothing of it this boy at once so powerful and so weak transplanted by corinne from the country he loved to be squeezed in the mould of a collegiate routine to which every spirit and every body must yield whatever their range or temperament accepting its rule and its uniform as gold is crushed into round coin under the press louis lambert suffered in every spot where pain can touch the soul or the flesh | stuck on a form restricted to the acreage of his desk a victim of the strap and to a sickly frame tortured in every sense environed by distress everything compelled him to give his body up to the myriad tyrannies of school life and like the martyrs who smiled in the midst of suffering he took refuge in heaven which lay open to his mind | perhaps this life of purely inward emotions helped him to see something of the mysteries he so entirely believed in | our independence our illicit amusements our apparent waste of time our persistent indifference our frequent punishments and aversion for our exercises and impositions earned us a reputation which no one cared to controvert for being an idle and incorrigible pair | our masters treated us with contempt and we fell into utter disgrace with our companions from whom we concealed our secret studies for fear of being laughed at | this hard judgment which was injustice in the masters was but natural in our schoolfellows | we could neither play ball nor run races nor walk on stilts | on exceptional holidays when amnesty was proclaimed and we got a few hours of freedom we shared in none of the popular diversions of the school | aliens from the pleasures enjoyed by the others we were outcasts sitting forlorn under a tree in the playing ground | the poet and pythagoras formed an exception and led a life apart from the life of the rest | the penetrating instinct and unerring conceit of schoolboys made them feel that we were of a nature either far above or far beneath their own hence some simply hated our aristocratic reserve others merely scorned our ineptitude | these feelings were equally shared by us without our knowing it perhaps i have but now divined them | we lived exactly like two rats huddled into the corner of the room where our desks were sitting there alike during lesson time and play hours | this strange state of affairs inevitably and in fact placed us on a footing of war with all the other boys in our division | forgotten for the most part we sat there very contentedly half happy like two plants two images who would have been missed from the furniture of the room | but the most aggressive of our schoolfellows would sometimes torment us just to show their malignant power and we responded with stolid contempt which brought many a thrashing down on the poet and pythagoras | lambert's home sickness lasted for many months | i know no words to describe the dejection to which he was a prey | louis has taken the glory off many a masterpiece for me | we had both played the part of the leper of aosta and had both experienced the feelings described in monsieur de maistre's story before we read them as expressed by his eloquent pen | a book may indeed revive the memories of our childhood but it can never compete with them successfully | lambert's woes had taught me many a chant of sorrow far more appealing than the finest passages in werther | and indeed there is no possible comparison between the pangs of a passion condemned whether rightly or wrongly by every law and the grief of a poor child pining for the glorious sunshine the dews of the valley and liberty | werther is the slave of desire louis lambert was an enslaved soul | given equal talent the more pathetic sorrow founded on desires which being purer are the more genuine must transcend the wail even of genius | after sitting for a long time with his eyes fixed on a lime tree in the playground louis would say just a word but that word would reveal an infinite speculation |  happily for me he exclaimed one day there are hours of comfort when i feel as though the walls of the room had fallen and i were away away in the fields | what a pleasure it is to let oneself go on the stream of one's thoughts as a bird is borne up on its wings |  why is green a color so largely diffused throughout creation | he would ask me |  why are there so few straight lines in nature | why is it that man in his structures rarely introduces curves | why is it that he alone of all creatures has a sense of straightness | these queries revealed long excursions in space | he had i am sure seen vast landscapes fragrant with the scent of woods | he was always silent and resigned a living elegy always suffering but unable to complain of suffering | an eagle that needed the world to feed him shut in between four narrow dirty walls and thus this life became an ideal life in the strictest meaning of the words | filled as he was with contempt of the almost useless studies to which we were harnessed louis went on his skyward way absolutely unconscious of the things about us | i obeying the imitative instinct that is so strong in childhood tired to regulate my life in conformity with his | and louis the more easily infected me with the sort of torpor in which deep contemplation leaves the body because i was younger and more impressionable than he | like two lovers we got into the habit of thinking together in a common reverie | his intuitions had already acquired that acuteness which must surely characterize the intellectual perceptiveness of great poets and often bring them to the verge of madness |  do you ever feel said he to me one day as though imagined suffering affected you in spite of yourself | if for instance i think with concentration of the effect that the blade of my penknife would have in piercing my flesh i feel an acute pain as if i had really cut myself only the blood is wanting | but the pain comes suddenly and startles me like a sharp noise breaking profound silence | can an idea cause physical pain what do you say to that eh | when he gave utterance to such subtle reflections we both fell into artless meditation we set to work to detect in ourselves the inscrutable phenomena of the origin of thoughts which lambert hoped to discover in their earliest germ so as to describe some day the unknown process | the roman or spanish astrologers cast the horoscope of the child according to the constellation which was in the ascendancy and congratulated cardinal rodrigo on the brilliant career foretold for his daughter by the stars | easter had just passed magnificent festivities had been held in honor of the elector ernst of saxony who together with the duke of brunswick and wilhelm von henneberg had arrived in rome march 22d | these gentlemen were accompanied by a retinue of two hundred knights and a house in the parione quarter had been placed at their disposal | pope sixtus iv loaded them with honors and great astonishment was caused by a magnificent hunt which girolamo riario the all powerful nepot gave for them at magliana on the tiber | these princes departed from rome on the fourteenth of april | the papacy was at that time changing to a political despotism and nepotism was assuming the character which later was to give c sar borgia all his ferocity | sixtus iv a mighty being and a character of a much more powerful cast than even alexander vi was at war with florence where he had countenanced the pazzi conspiracy for the murder of the medici | he had made girolamo riario a great prince in romagna and later alexander vi planned a similar career for his son c sar | lucretia was indeed born at a terrible period in the world's history the papacy was stripped of all holiness religion was altogether material and immorality was boundless | the bitterest family feuds raged in the city in the ponte parione and regola quarters where kinsmen incited by murder daily met in deadly combat | in this very year 1480 there was a new uprising of the old factions of guelph and ghibbeline in rome there the savelli and colonna were against the pope and here the orsini for him while the valle margana and santa croce families inflamed by a desire for revenge for blood which had been shed allied themselves with one or the other faction | footnotes: 5 gianandrea boccaccio to the duke rome february 25 and march 11 1493 | state archives of modena |  6 sanuto diar | v i 258 | chapter iii lucretia's first home lucretia passed the first years of her childhood in her mother's house which was on the piazza pizzo di merlo only a few steps from the cardinal's palace | the ponte quarter to which it belonged was one of the most populous of rome since it led to the bridge of s angelo and the vatican | in it were to be found many merchants and the bankers from florence genoa and siena while numerous papal office holders as well as the most famous courtesans dwelt there | on the other hand the number of old noble families in ponte was not large perhaps because the orsini faction did not permit them to thrive there | these powerful barons had resided in this quarter for a long time in their vast palace on monte giordano | not far distant stood their old castle the torre di nona which had originally been part of the city walls on the tiber | at this time it was a dungeon for prisoners of state and other unfortunates | it is not difficult to imagine what vannozza's house was for the roman dwelling of the renaissance did not greatly differ from the ordinary house of the present day which generally is gloomy and dark | massive steps of cement led to the dwelling proper which consisted of a principal salon and adjoining rooms with bare flagstone floors and ceilings of beams and painted wooden paneling | the walls of the rooms were whitewashed and only in the wealthiest houses were they covered with tapestries and in these only on festal occasions | in the fifteenth century the walls of few houses were adorned with pictures and these usually consisted of only a few family portraits | if vannozza decorated her salon with any likenesses that of cardinal rodrigo certainly must have been among the number | there was likewise a shrine with relics and pictures of the saints and one of the madonna the lamp constantly burning before it | heavy furniture great wide beds with canopies high brown wooden chairs elaborately carved upon which cushions were placed and massive tables with tops made of marble or bits of colored wood was ranged around the walls | among the great chests there was one which stood out conspicuously in the salon and which contained the dowry of linen | it was in such a chest the chest of his sister that the unfortunate stefano porcaro concealed himself when he endeavored to escape after his unsuccessful attempt to excite an uprising on the fifth of january 1453 | his sister and another woman sat on the chest better to protect him but the officers pulled him out | although we can only state what was then the fashion if vannozza had any taste for antiquities her salon must have been adorned with them | at that time they were being collected with the greatest eagerness | it was the period of the first excavations the soil of rome was daily giving up its treasures and from ostia tivoli and hadrian's villa from porto d'anzio and palestrina quantities of antiquities were being brought to the city | if vannozza and her husband did not share this passion with the other romans one would certainly not have looked in vain in her house for the cherished productions of modern art cups and vases of marble and porphyry and the gold ornaments of the jewelers | the most essential thing in every well ordered roman house was above all else the credenza a great chest containing gold and silver table and drinking vessels and beautiful majolica and care was taken always to display these articles at banquets and on other ceremonious occasions | it is not likely that rodrigo's mistress possessed a library for private collections of books were at that time exceedingly rare in bourgeois houses | a short time after this they were first made possible in rome by the invention of printing which was there carried on by germans | vannozza's household doubtless was rich but not magnificent | she must occasionally have entertained the cardinal as well as the friends of the family and especially the confidants of the borgias: the spaniards juan lopez caranza and marades and among the romans the orsini porcari cesarini and barberini | the cardinal himself was an exceedingly abstemious man but magnificent in everything which concerned the pomp and ceremonial of his position | the chief requirement of a cardinal of that day was to own a princely residence and to have a numerous household | rodrigo borgia was one of the wealthiest princes of the church and he maintained the palace and pomp of a great noble | his contemporary jacopo of volterra gave the following description of him about 1486: he is a man of an intellect capable of everything and of great sense he is a ready speaker he is of an astute nature and has wonderful skill in conducting affairs | he is enormously wealthy and the favor accorded him by numerous kings and princes lends him renown | he occupies a beautiful and comfortable palace which he built between the bridge of s angelo and the campo dei fiore | his papal offices his numerous abbeys in italy and spain and his three bishoprics of valencia portus and carthage yield him a vast income and it is said that the office of vice chancellor alone brings him in eight thousand gold florins | his plate his pearls his stuffs embroidered with silk and gold and his books in every department of learning are very numerous and all are of a magnificence worthy of a king or pope | i need not mention the innumerable bed hangings the trappings for his horses and similar things of gold silver and silk nor his magnificent wardrobe nor the vast amount of gold coin in his possession | in fact it was believed that he possessed more gold and riches of every sort than all the cardinals together with the exception of one estouteville | cardinal rodrigo therefore was able to give his children the most brilliant education while he modestly maintained them as his nephews | not until he himself had attained greatness could he bring them forth into the full light of day | in 1482 he did not occupy his house in the ponte quarter perhaps because he was having it enlarged | he spent more of his time in the palace which stefano nardini had finished in 1475 in the parione quarter which is now known as the palazzo del governo vecchio | rodrigo was living here in january 1482 as we learn from an instrument of the notary beneimbene the marriage contract of gianandrea cesarini and girolama borgia a natural daughter of the same cardinal rodrigo | this marriage was performed in the presence of the bride's father cardinals stefano nardini and gianbattista savelli and the roman nobles virginius orsini giuliano cesarini and antonio porcaro | the instrument of january 1482 is the earliest authentic document we possess regarding the family life of cardinal borgia | in it he acknowledges himself to be the father of the noble demoiselle hieronyma and she is described as the sister of the noble youth petrus lodovicus de borgia and of the infant johannes de borgia | as these two plainly mentioned as the eldest sons were natural children it would have been improper to name their mother | c sar also was passed by as he was a child of only six years | girolama was still a minor being only thirteen years of age and her betrothed giovanni andrea had scarcely reached manhood | he was a son of gabriello cesarini and godina colonna | by this marriage the noble house of cesarini was brought into close relations with the borgia and later it derived great profit from the alliance | their mutual friendship dated from the time of calixtus for it was the prothonotary giorgio cesarini who on the death of that pope had helped rodrigo's brother don pedro luis when he was forced to flee from rome | both girolama and her youthful spouse died in 1483 | was she also a child of the mother of lucretia and c sar | we know not but it is regarded as unlikely | let us anticipate by saying that there is only a single authentic record which mentions rodrigo's children and their mother together | this is the inscription on vannozza's tomb in s maria del popolo in rome in which she is named as the mother of c sar giovanni giuffr and lucretia while no mention is made of their older brother don pedro luis nor of their sister girolama | rodrigo moreover had a third daughter named isabella who could not have been a child of vannozza | april 1 1483 he married her to a roman nobleman piergiovanni mattuzi of the parione quarter |  7 footnotes: 7 abstract of the marriage contract in the archives of the capitol |cred  xiv t |72  from an instrument of the notary agostino martini | chapter iv lucretia's education the cardinal's relations with vannozza continued until about 1482 for after the birth of lucretia she presented him with another son giuffr who was born in 1481 or 1482 | after that borgia's passion for this woman who was now about forty died out but he continued to honor her as the mother of his children and as the confidant of many of his secrets | vannozza had borne her husband a certain giorgio di croce a son who was named octavian at least this child passed as his | with the cardinal's help she increased her revenues in old official records she appears as the lessee of several taverns in rome and she also bought a vineyard and a country house near s lucia in selci in the subura apparently from the cesarini | even to day the picturesque building with the arched passageway over the stairs which lead up from the subura to s pietro in vincoli is pointed out to travelers as the palace of vannozza or of lucretia borgia | giorgio di croce had become rich and he built a chapel for himself and his family in s maria del popolo | both he and his son octavian died in the year 1486 |  8 his death caused a change in vannozza's circumstances the cardinal hastening to marry the mother of his children a second time so that she might have a protector and a respectable household | the new husband was carlo canale of mantua | before he came to rome he had by his attainments acquired some reputation among the humanists of mantua | there is still extant a letter to canale written by the young poet angelo poliziano regarding his orfeo the manuscript of this the first attempt in the field of the drama which marked the renaissance of the italian theater was in the hands of canale who appreciating the work of the faint hearted poet was endeavoring to encourage him |  9 at the suggestion of cardinal francesco gonzaga a great patron of letters poliziano had written the poem in the short space of two days | carlo canale was the cardinal's chamberlain | the orfeo saw the light in 1472 | when gonzaga died in 1483 canale went to rome where he entered the service of cardinal sclafetano of parma | as a confidant and dependent of the gonzaga he retained his connection with this princely house |  10 in his new position he assisted ludovico gonzaga a brother of francesco when he came to rome in 1484 to receive the purple on his election as bishop of mantua | borgia was acquainted with canale while he was in the service of the gonzaga and later he met him in the house of sclafetano | he selected him to be the husband of his widowed mistress doubtless because canale's talents and connections would be useful to him | canale on the other hand could have acquiesced in the suggestion to marry vannozza only from avarice and his willingness proves that he had not grown rich in his former places at the courts of cardinals | the new marriage contract was drawn up june 8 1486 by the notary of the borgia house camillo beneimbene and was witnessed by francesco maffei apostolic secretary and canon of s peter's lorenzo barberini de catellinis a citizen giuliano gallo a considerable merchant of rome burcardo barberini de carnariis and other gentlemen | as dowry vannozza brought her husband among other things one thousand gold florins and an appointment as sollicitator bullarum | the contract clearly referred to this as vannozza's second marriage | would it not have been set down as the third or in more general terms as new if the alleged first marriage with domenico d'arignano had really been acknowledged | in this instrument vannozza's house on the piazza de branchis in the regola quarter where the marriage took place is described as her domicile | the piazza still bears this name which is derived from the extinct branca family | after the death of her former husband she must therefore have moved from the house on the piazza pizzo di merlo and taken up her abode in the one on the piazza branca | this house may have belonged to her for her second husband seems to have been a man without means who hoped to make his fortune by his marriage and with the protection of the powerful cardinal | from a letter of ludovico gonzaga dated february 19 1488 we learn that this new marriage of vannozza's was not childless | in this epistle the bishop of mantua asks his agent in rome to act as godfather in his stead carlo canale having chosen him for this honor | the letter gives no further particulars but it can mean nothing else |  11 we do not know at just what time lucretia in accordance with the cardinal's provision left her mother's house and passed under the protection of a woman who exercised great influence upon him and upon the entire borgia family | this woman was adriana of the house of mila a daughter of don pedro who was a nephew of calixtus iii and first cousin of rodrigo | what position he held in rome we do not know | he married his daughter adriana to ludovico a member of the noble house of orsini and lord of bassanello near civita castellana | as the offspring of this union orsino orsini married in 1489 it is evident that his mother must have entered into wedlock at least sixteen years before | ludovico orsini died in 1489 or earlier | as his wife and later as his widow adriana occupied one of the orsini palaces in rome probably the one on monte giordano near the bridge of s angelo this palace having subsequently been described as part of the estate which her son orsino inherited | cardinal rodrigo maintained the closest relations with adriana | she was more than his kinswoman she was the confidant of his sins of his intrigues and plans and such she remained until the day of his death | to her he entrusted the education of his daughter lucretia during her childhood as we learn from a letter written by the ferrarese ambassador to rome gianandrea boccaccio bishop of modena to the duke ercole in 1493 in which he remarks of madonna adriana ursina that she had educated lucretia in her own house |  12 this doubtless was the orsini palace on monte giordano which was close to cardinal borgia's residence | according to the italian custom which has survived to the present day the education of the daughters was entrusted to women in convents where the young girls were required to pass a few years afterwards to come forth into the world to be married | if however infessura's picture of the convents of rome is a faithful one the cardinal was wise in hesitating to entrust his daughter to these saints | nevertheless there certainly were convents which were free from immorality such for example as s silvestre in capite where many of the daughters of the colonna were educated and s maria nuova and s sisto on the appian way | on one occasion during the papacy of alexander lucretia chose the last named convent as an asylum perhaps because she had there received her early spiritual education | religious instruction was always the basis of the education of the women of italy | it however consisted not in the cultivation of heart and soul but in a strict observance of the forms of religion | sin made no woman repulsive and the condition of even the most degraded female did not prevent her from performing all her church duties and appearing to be a well trained christian | there were no women skeptics or freethinkers they would have been impossible in the society of that day | the godless tyrant sigismondo malatesta of rimini built a magnificent church and in it a chapel in honor of his beloved isotta who was a regular attendant at church | vannozza built and embellished a chapel in s maria del popolo | she had a reputation for piety even during the life of alexander vi | her greatest maternal solicitude like that of adriana was to inculcate a christian deportment in her daughter and this lucretia possessed in such perfection that subsequently a ferrarese ambassador lauded her for her 'saintly demeanor '| it is wrong to regard this bearing simply as a mask for that would presuppose an independent consideration of religious questions or a moral process which was altogether foreign to the women of that age and is still unknown among the women of italy | there religion was and still is a part of education it consisted in a high respect for form and was of small ethical worth | the daughters of the well to do families did not receive instruction in the humanities in the convents but probably from the same teachers to whom the education of the sons was entrusted | it is no exaggeration to say that the women of the better classes during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were as well educated as are the women of to day | their education was not broad it was limited to a few branches for then they did not have the almost inexhaustible means of improvement which thanks to the evolution of the human mind during the last three hundred years we now enjoy | the education of the women of the renaissance was based upon classical antiquity in comparison with which everything which could then be termed modern was insignificant | they might therefore have been described as scholarly | feminine education is now entirely different as it is derived wholly from modern sources of culture | it is precisely its many sidedness to which is due the superficiality of the education of contemporary woman when compared with that of her sister of the renaissance | the education of women at the present time generally even in germany which is famous for its schools is without solid foundation and altogether superficial and of no real worth | it consists usually in acquiring a smattering of two modern tongues and learning to play the piano to which a wholly unreasonable amount of time is devoted | during the renaissance the piano was unknown but every educated woman performed upon the lute which had the advantage that in the hands of the lady playing it it presented an agreeable picture to the eyes while the piano is only a machine which compels the man or the woman who is playing it to go through motions which are always unpleasant and often ridiculous | during the renaissance the novel showed only its first beginnings and even to day italy is the country which produces and reads the fewest romances | there were stories from the time of boccaccio but very few | vast numbers of poems were written but half of them in latin | printing and the book trade were in their infancy | the theater likewise was in its childhood and as a rule dramatic performances were given only once a year during the carnival and then only on private stages | what we now call universal literature or culture consisted at that time in the passionate study of the classics | latin and greek held the place then which the study of foreign languages now occupies in the education of women | the italians of the renaissance did not think that an acquaintance with the classics that scientific knowledge destroyed the charm of womanliness nor that the education of women should be less advanced than that of men | this opinion like so many others prevalent in society is of teutonic origin | the loving dominion of the mother in the family circle has always seemed to the germanic races to be the realization of the ideal of womanliness | for a long time german women avoided publicity owing to modesty or a feeling of decorum | their talents remained hidden except in cases where peculiar circumstances sometimes connected with affairs of court or of state compelled them to come forth | until recently the history of german civilization has shown a much smaller number of famous female characters than italy the land of strong personalities produced during the renaissance | the influence which gifted women in the italian salons of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and later in those of france exercised upon the intellectual development of society was completely unknown in england and germany | later however there was a change in the relative degree of feminine culture in teutonic and latin countries | in the former it rose while in italy it declined | the italian woman who during the renaissance occupied a place by man's side contended with him for intellectual prizes and took part in every spiritual movement fell into the background | during the last two hundred years she has taken little or no part in the higher life of the nation for long ago she became a mere tool in the hands of the priests | the reformation gave the german woman greater personal freedom | especially since the beginning of the eighteenth century have germany and england produced numbers of highly cultivated and even learned women | the superficiality of the education of woman in general in germany is not the fault of the church but of the fashion of society and also of lack of means in our families | a learned woman whom men are more apt to fear than respect is called when she writes books a blue stocking | during the renaissance she was called a virago a title which was perfectly complimentary | he gave the will precedence over the mind |  you must will before you can think he said |  many beings live in a condition of willing without ever attaining to the condition of thinking | in the north life is long in the south it is shorter but in the north we see torpor in the south a constant excitability of the will up to the point where from an excess of cold or of heat the organs are almost nullified | the use of the word medium was suggested to him by an observation he had made in his childhood though to be sure he had no suspicion then of its importance but its singularity naturally struck his delicately alert imagination | his mother a fragile nervous woman all sensitiveness and affection was one of those beings created to represent womanhood in all the perfection of her attributes but relegated by a mistaken fate to too low a place in the social scale | wholly loving and consequently wholly suffering she died young having thrown all her energies into her motherly love | lambert a child of six lying but not always sleeping in a cot by his mother's bed saw the electric sparks from her hair when she combed it | the man of fifteen made scientific application of this fact which had amused the child a fact beyond dispute of which there is ample evidence in many instances especially of women who by a sad fatality are doomed to let unappreciated feelings evaporate in the air or some superabundant power run to waste | in support of his definitions lambert propounded a variety of problems to be solved challenges flung out to science though he proposed to seek the solution for himself | he inquired for instance whether the element that constitutes electricity does not enter as a base into the specific fluid whence our ideas and volitions proceed | whether the hair which loses its color turns white falls out or disappears in proportion to the decay or crystallization of our thoughts may not be in fact a capillary system either absorbent or diffusive and wholly electrical | whether the fluid phenomena of the will a matter generated within us and spontaneously reacting under the impress of conditions as yet unobserved were at all more extraordinary than those of the invisible and intangible fluid produced by a voltaic pile and applied to the nervous system of a dead man | whether the formation of ideas and their constant diffusion was less incomprehensible than evaporation of the atoms imperceptible indeed but so violent in their effects that are given off from a grain of musk without any loss of weight | whether granting that the function of the skin is purely protective absorbent excretive and tactile the circulation of the blood and all its mechanism would not correspond with the transsubstantiation of our will as the circulation of the nerve fluid corresponds to that of the mind | finally whether the more or less rapid affluence of these two real substances may not be the result of a certain perfection or imperfection of organs whose conditions require investigation in every manifestation | having set forth these principles he proposed to class the phenomena of human life in two series of distinct results demanding with the ardent insistency of conviction a special analysis for each | in fact having observed in almost every type of created thing two separate motions he assumed nay he asserted their existence in our human nature and designated this vital antithesis action and reaction |  a desire he said is a fact completely accomplished in our will before it is accomplished externally | hence the sum total of our volitions and our ideas constitutes action and the sum total of our external acts he called reaction | when i subsequently read the observations made by bichat on the duality of our external senses i was really bewildered by my recollections recognizing the startling coincidences between the views of that celebrated physiologist and those of louis lambert | they both died young and they had with equal steps arrived at the same strange truths | nature has in every case been pleased to give a twofold purpose to the various apparatus that constitute her creatures and the twofold action of the human organism which is now ascertained beyond dispute proves by a mass of evidence in daily life how true were lambert's deductions as to action and reaction | the inner being the being of action the word he used to designate an unknown specialization the mysterious nexus of fibrils to which we owe the inadequately investigated powers of thought and will in short the nameless entity which sees acts foresees the end and accomplishes everything before expressing itself in any physical phenomenon must in conformity with its nature be free from the physical conditions by which the external being of reaction the visible man is fettered in its manifestation | from this followed a multitude of logical explanation as to those results of our twofold nature which appear the strangest and a rectification of various systems in which truth and falsehood are mingled | certain men having had a glimpse of some phenomena of the natural working of the being of action were like swedenborg carried away above this world by their ardent soul thirsting for poetry and filled with the divine spirit | thus in their ignorance of the causes and their admiration of the facts they pleased their fancy by regarding that inner man as divine and constructing a mystical universe | hence we have angels | a lovely illusion which lambert would never abandon cherishing it even when the sword of his logic was cutting off their dazzling wings |  heaven he would say must after all be the survival of our perfected faculties and hell the void into which our unperfected faculties are cast away | but how then in the ages when the understanding had preserved the religious and spiritualist impressions which prevailed from the time of christ till that of descartes between faith and doubt how could men help accounting for the mysteries of our nature otherwise than by divine interposition | of whom but of god himself could sages demand an account of an invisible creature so actively and so reactively sensitive gifted with faculties so extensive so improvable by use and so powerful under certain occult influences that they could sometimes see it annihilate by some phenomenon of sight or movement space in its two manifestations time and distance of which the former is the space of the intellect the latter is physical space | sometimes they found it reconstructing the past either by the power of retrospective vision or by the mystery of a palingenesis not unlike the power a man might have of detecting in the form integument and embryo in a seed the flowers of the past and the numberless variations of their color scent and shape and sometimes again it could be seen vaguely foreseeing the future either by its apprehension of final causes or by some phenomenon of physical presentiment | other men less poetically religious cold and argumentative quacks perhaps but enthusiasts in brain at least if not in heart recognizing some isolated examples of such phenomena admitted their truth while refusing to consider them as radiating from a common centre | each of these was then bent on constructing a science out of a simple fact | hence arose demonology judicial astrology the black arts in short every form of divination founded on circumstances that were essentially transient because they varied according to men's temperament and to conditions that are still completely unknown | but from these errors of the learned and from the ecclesiastical trials under which fell so many martyrs to their own powers startling evidence was derived of the prodigious faculties at the command of the being of action which according to lambert can abstract itself completely from the being of reaction bursting its envelope and piercing walls by its potent vision a phenomenon known to the hindoos as missionaries tell us by the name of tokeiad or again by another faculty can grasp in the brain in spite of its closest convolutions the ideas which are formed or forming there and the whole of past consciousness |  if apparitions are not impossible said lambert they must be due to a faculty of discerning the ideas which represent man in his purest essence whose life imperishable perhaps escapes our grosser senses though they may become perceptible to the inner being when it has reached a high degree of ecstasy or a great perfection of vision | i know though my remembrance is now vague that lambert by following the results of mind and will step by step after he had established their laws accounted for a multitude of phenomena which till then had been regarded with reason as incomprehensible | thus wizards men possessed with second sight and demoniacs of every degree the victims of the middle ages became the subject of explanations so natural that their very simplicity often seemed to me the seal of their truth | the marvelous gifts which the church of rome jealous of all mysteries punished with the stake were in louis' opinion the result of certain affinities between the constituent elements of matter and those of mind which proceed from the same source | the man holding a hazel rod when he found a spring of water was guided by some antipathy or sympathy of which he was unconscious nothing but the eccentricity of these phenomena could have availed to give some of them historic certainty | sympathies have rarely been proved they afford a kind of pleasure which those who are so happy as to possess them rarely speak of unless they are abnormally singular and even then only in the privacy of intimate intercourse where everything is buried | but the antipathies that arise from the inversion of affinities have very happily been recorded when developed by famous men | thus bayle had hysterics when he heard water splashing scaliger turned pale at the sight of water cress erasmus was thrown into a fever by the smell of fish | these three antipathies were connected with water | the duc d'epernon fainted at the sight of a hare tycho brahe at that of a fox henri iii | at the presence of a cat the marechal d'albret at the sight of a wild hog these antipathies were produced by animal emanations and often took effect at a great distance | the chevalier de guise marie de medici and many other persons have felt faint at seeing a rose even in a painting | lord bacon whether he were forewarned or no of an eclipse of the moon always fell into a syncope while it lasted and his vitality suspended while the phenomenon lasted was restored as soon as it was over without his feeling any further inconvenience | these effects of antipathy all well authenticated and chosen from among many which history has happened to preserve are enough to give a clue to the sympathies which remain unknown | this fragment of lambert's investigations which i remember from among his essays will throw a light on the method on which he worked | i need not emphasize the obvious connection between this theory and the collateral sciences projected by gall and lavater they were its natural corollary and every more or less scientific brain will discern the ramifications by which it is inevitably connected with the phrenological observations of one and the speculations on physiognomy of the other | mesmer's discovery so important though as yet so little appreciated was also embodied in a single section of this treatise though louis did not know the swiss doctor's writings which are few and brief | a simple and logical inference from these principles led him to perceive that the will might be accumulated by a contractile effort of the inner man and then by another effort projected or even imparted to material objects | thus the whole force of a man must have the property of reacting on other men and of infusing into them an essence foreign to their own if they could not protect themselves against such an aggression | the evidence of this theorem of the science of humanity is of course very multifarious but there is nothing to establish it beyond question | we have only the notorious disaster of marius and his harangue to the cimbrian commanded to kill him or the august injunction of a mother to the lion of florence in historic proof of instances of such lightning flashes of mind | to lambert then will and thought were living forces and he spoke of them in such a way as to impress his belief on the hearer | to him these two forces were in a way visible tangible | thought was slow or alert heavy or nimble light or dark he ascribed to it all the attributes of an active agent and thought of it as rising resting waking expanding growing old shrinking becoming atrophied or resuscitating he described its life and specified all its actions by the strangest words in our language speaking of its spontaneity its strength and all its qualities with a kind of intuition which enabled him to recognize all the manifestations of its substantial existence |  often said he in the midst of quiet and silence when our inner faculties are dormant when a sort of darkness reigns within us and we are lost in the contemplation of things outside us an idea suddenly flies forth and rushes with the swiftness of lightning across the infinite space which our inner vision allows us to perceive | this radiant idea springing into existence like a will o' the wisp dies out never to return an ephemeral life like that of babes who give their parents such infinite joy and sorrow a sort of still born blossom in the fields of the mind | sometimes an idea instead of springing forcibly into life and dying unembodied dawns gradually hovers in the unknown limbo of the organs where it has its birth exhausts us by long gestation develops is itself fruitful grows outwardly in all the grace of youth and the promising attributes of a long life it can endure the closest inspection invites it and never tires the sight the investigation it undergoes commands the admiration we give to works slowly elaborated | sometimes ideas are evolved in a swarm one brings another they come linked together they vie with each other they fly in clouds wild and headlong | again they rise up pallid and misty and perish for want of strength or of nutrition the vital force is lacking | or again on certain days they rush down into the depths to light up that immense obscurity they terrify us and leave the soul dejected |  ideas are a complete system within us resembling a natural kingdom a sort of flora of which the iconography will one day be outlined by some man who will perhaps be accounted a madman |  yes within us and without everything testifies to the livingness of those exquisite creations which i compare with flowers in obedience to some unutterable revelation of their true nature |  their being produced as the final cause of man is after all not more amazing than the production of perfume and color in a plant | perfumes are ideas perhaps |  when we consider the line where flesh ends and the nail begins contains the invisible and inexplicable mystery of the constant transformation of a fluid into horn we must confess that nothing is impossible in the marvelous modifications of human tissue |  and are there not in our inner nature phenomena of weight and motion comparable to those of physical nature | suspense to choose an example vividly familiar to everybody is painful only as a result of the law in virtue of which the weight of a body is multiplied by its velocity | the weight of the feeling produced by suspense increases by the constant addition of past pain to the pain of the moment |  and then to what unless it be to the electric fluid are we to attribute the magic by which the will enthrones itself so imperiously in the eye to demolish obstacles at the behest of genius thunders in the voice or filters in spite of dissimulation through the human frame | the current of that sovereign fluid which in obedience to the high pressure of thought or of feeling flows in a torrent or is reduced to a mere thread and collects to flash in lightnings is the occult agent to which are due the evil or the beneficent efforts of art and passion intonation of voice whether harsh or suave terrible lascivious horrifying or seductive by turns thrilling the heart the nerves or the brain at our will the marvels of the touch the instrument of the mental transfusions of a myriad artists whose creative fingers are able after passionate study to reproduce the forms of nature or again the infinite gradations of the eye from dull inertia to the emission of the most terrifying gleams |  by this system god is bereft of none of his rights | mind as a form of matter has brought me a new conviction of his greatness | after hearing him discourse thus after receiving into my soul his look like a ray of light it was difficult not to be dazzled by his conviction and carried away by his arguments | the mind appeared to me as a purely physical power surrounded by its innumerable progeny | it was a new conception of humanity under a new form | this brief sketch of the laws which as lambert maintained constitute the formula of our intellect must suffice to give a notion of the prodigious activity of his spirit feeding on itself | louis had sought for proofs of his theories in the history of great men whose lives as set forth by their biographers supply very curious particulars as to the operation of their understanding | his memory allowed him to recall such facts as might serve to support his statements he had appended them to each chapter in the form of demonstrations so as to give to many of his theories an almost mathematical certainty | the works of cardan a man gifted with singular powers of insight supplied him with valuable materials | he had not forgotten that apollonius of tyana had in asia announced the death of a tyrant with every detail of his execution at the very hour when it was taking place in rome nor that plotinus when far away from porphyrius was aware of his friend's intention to kill himself and flew to dissuade him nor the incident in the last century proved in the face of the most incredulous mockery ever known an incident most surprising to men who were accustomed to regard doubt as a weapon against the fact alone but simple enough to believers the fact that alphonzo maria di liguori bishop of saint agatha administered consolations to pope ganganelli who saw him heard him and answered him while the bishop himself at a great distance from rome was in a trance at home in the chair where he commonly sat on his return from mass | on recovering consciousness he saw all his attendants kneeling beside him believing him to be dead: my friends said he the holy father is just dead | two days later a letter confirmed the news | the hour of the pope's death coincided with that when the bishop had been restored to his natural state | nor had lambert omitted the yet more recent adventure of an english girl who was passionately attached to a sailor and set out from london to seek him | she found him without a guide making her way alone in the north american wilderness reaching him just in time to save his life | louis had found confirmatory evidence in the mysteries of the ancients in the acts of the martyrs in which glorious instances may be found of the triumph of human will in the demonology of the middle ages in criminal trials and medical researches always selecting the real fact the probable phenomenon with admirable sagacity | all this rich collection of scientific anecdotes culled from so many books most of them worthy of credit served no doubt to wrap parcels in and this work which was curious to say the least of it as the outcome of a most extraordinary memory was doomed to destruction | among the various cases which added to the value of lambert's treatise was an incident that had taken place in his own family of which he had told me before he wrote his essay | this fact bearing on the post existence of the inner man if i may be allowed to coin a new word for a phenomenon hitherto nameless struck me so forcibly that i have never forgotten it | his father and mother were being forced into a lawsuit of which the loss would leave them with a stain on their good name the only thing they had in the world | hence their anxiety was very great when the question first arose as to whether they should yield to the plaintiff's unjust demands or should defend themselves against him | the matter came under discussion one autumn evening before a turf fire in the room used by the tanner and his wife | two or three relations were invited to this family council and among others louis' maternal great grandfather an old laborer much bent but with a venerable and dignified countenance bright eyes and a bald yellow head on which grew a few locks of thin white hair | like the obi of the negroes or the sagamore of the indian savages he was a sort of oracle consulted on important occasions | his land was tilled by his grandchildren who fed and served him he predicted rain and fine weather and told them when to mow the hay and gather the crops | the barometric exactitude of his forecasts was quite famous and added to the confidence and respect he inspired | for whole days he would sit immovable in his armchair | this state of rapt meditation often came upon him since his wife's death he had been attached to her in the truest and most faithful affection | this discussion was held in his presence but he did not seem to give much heed to it |  my children said he when he was asked for his opinion this is too serious a matter for me to decide on alone | i must go and consult my wife | the old man rose took his stick and went out to the great astonishment of the others who thought him daft | he presently came back and said: i did not have to go so far as the graveyard your mother came to meet me i found her by the brook | she tells me that you will find some receipts in the hands of a notary at blois which will enable you to gain your suit | the words were spoken in a firm tone the old man's demeanor and countenance showed that such an apparition was habitual with him | in fact the disputed receipts were found and the lawsuit was not attempted | this event under his father's roof and to his own knowledge when louis was nine years old contributed largely to his belief in swedenborg's miraculous visions for in the course of that philosopher's life he repeatedly gave proof of the power of sight developed in his inner being | as he grew older and as his intelligence was developed lambert was naturally led to seek in the laws of nature for the causes of the miracle which in his childhood had captivated his attention | what name can be given to the chance which brought within his ken so many facts and books bearing on such phenomena and made him the principal subject and actor in such marvelous manifestations of mind | if lambert had no other title to fame than the fact of his having formulated in his sixteenth year such a psychological dictum as this: the events which bear witness to the action of the human race and are the outcome of its intellect have causes by which they are preconceived as our actions are accomplished in our minds before they are reproduced by the outer man presentiments or predictions are the perception of these causes i think we may deplore in him a genius equal to pascal lavoisier or laplace | his chimerical notions about angels perhaps overruled his work too long but was it not in trying to make gold that the alchemists unconsciously created chemistry | at the same time lambert at a later period studied comparative anatomy physics geometry and other sciences bearing on his discoveries and this was undoubtedly with the purpose of collecting facts and submitting them to analysis the only torch that can guide us through the dark places of the most inscrutable work of nature | he had too much good sense to dwell among the clouds of theories which can all be expressed in a few words | in our day is not the simplest demonstration based on facts more highly esteemed than the most specious system though defended by more or less ingenious inductions | but as i did not know him at the period of his life when his cogitations were no doubt the most productive of results i can only conjecture that the bent of his work must have been from that of his first efforts of thought | it is easy to see where his treatise on the will was faulty | though gifted already with the powers which characterize superior men he was but a boy | his brain though endowed with a great faculty for abstractions was still full of the delightful beliefs that hover around youth | thus his conception while at some points it touched the ripest fruits of his genius still by many more clung to the smaller elements of its germs | to certain readers lovers of poetry what he chiefly lacked must have been a certain vein of interest | but his work bore the stamp of the struggle that was going on in that noble spirit between the two great principles of spiritualism and materialism round which so many a fine genius has beaten its way without ever daring to amalgamate them | louis at first purely spiritualist had been irresistibly led to recognize the material conditions of mind | confounded by the facts of analysis at the moment when his heart still gazed with yearning at the clouds which floated in swedenborg's heaven he had not yet acquired the necessary powers to produce a coherent system compactly cast in a piece as it were | hence certain inconsistencies that have left their stamp even on the sketch here given of his first attempts | still incomplete as his work may have been was it not the rough copy of a science of which he would have investigated the secrets at a later time have secured the foundations have examined deduced and connected the logical sequence | six months after the confiscation of the treatise on the will i left school | our parting was unexpected | my mother alarmed by a feverish attack which for some months i had been unable to shake off while my inactive life induced symptoms of coma carried me off at four or five hours' notice | the announcement of my departure reduced lambert to dreadful dejection |  shall i ever seen you again | said he in his gentle voice as he clasped me in his arms |  you will live he went on but i shall die | if i can i will come back to you | only the young can utter such words with the accent of conviction that gives them the impressiveness of prophecy of a pledge leaving a terror of its fulfilment | for a long time indeed i vaguely looked for the promised apparition | even now there are days of depression of doubt alarm and loneliness when i am forced to repel the intrusion of that sad parting though it was not fated to be the last | when i crossed the yard by which we left lambert was at one of the refectory windows to see me pass | by my request my mother obtained leave for him to dine with us at the inn and in the evening i escorted him back to the fatal gate of the college | no lover and his mistress ever shed more tears at parting |  well good bye i shall be left alone in this desert | said he pointing to the playground where two hundred boys were disporting themselves and shouting |  when i come back half dead with fatigue from my long excursions through the fields of thought on whose heart can i rest | i could tell you everything in a look | who will understand me now good bye | i could wish i had never met you i should not know all i am losing |  and what is to become of me | said i |  is not my position a dreadful one | i have nothing here to uphold me | and i slapped my forehead | he shook his head with a gentle gesture gracious and sad and we parted | at that time louis lambert was about five feet five inches in height he grew no more | his countenance which was full of expression revealed his sweet nature | divine patience developed by harsh usage and the constant concentration needed for his meditative life had bereft his eyes of the audacious pride which is so attractive in some faces and which had so shocked our masters | peaceful mildness gave charm to his face an exquisite serenity that was never marred by a tinge of irony or satire for his natural kindliness tempered his conscious strength and superiority | he had pretty hands very slender and almost always moist | his frame was a marvel a model for a sculptor but our iron gray uniform with gilt buttons and knee breeches gave us such an ungainly appearance that lambert's fine proportions and firm muscles could only be appreciated in the bath | when we swam in our pool in the loire louis was conspicuous by the whiteness of his skin which was unlike the different shades of our schoolfellows' bodies mottled by the cold or blue from the water | gracefully formed elegant in his attitudes delicate in hue never shivering after his bath perhaps because he avoided the shade and always ran into the sunshine louis was like one of those cautious blossoms that close their petals to the blast and refuse to open unless to a clear sky | he ate little and drank water only either by instinct or by choice he was averse to any exertion that made a demand on his strength his movements were few and simple like those of orientals or of savages with whom gravity seems a condition of nature | as a rule he disliked everything that resembled any special care for his person | he commonly sat with his head a little inclined to the left and so constantly rested his elbows on the table that the sleeves of his coats were soon in holes | to this slight picture of the outer man i must add a sketch of his moral qualities for i believe i can now judge him impartially | though naturally religious louis did not accept the minute practices of the roman ritual his ideas were more intimately in sympathy with saint theresa and fenelon and several fathers and certain saints who in our day would be regarded as heresiarchs or atheists | he was rigidly calm during the services | his own prayers went up in gusts in aspirations without any regular formality in all things he gave himself up to nature and would not pray any more than he would think at any fixed hour | in chapel he was equally apt to think of god or to meditate on some problem of philosophy | to him jesus christ was the most perfect type of his system | et verbum caro factum est seemed a sublime statement intended to express the traditional formula of the will the word and the act made visible | christ's unconsciousness of his death having so perfected his inner being by divine works that one day the invisible form of it appeared to his disciples and the other mysteries of the gospels the magnetic cures wrought by christ and the gift of tongues all to him confirmed his doctrine | i remember once hearing him say on this subject that the greatest work that could be written nowadays was a history of the primitive church | and he never rose to such poetic heights as when in the evening as we conversed he would enter on an inquiry into miracles worked by the power of will during that great age of faith | he discerned the strongest evidence of his theory in most of the martyrdoms endured during the first century of our era which he spoke of as the great era of the mind |  do not the phenomena observed in almost every instance of the torments so heroically endured by the early christians for the establishment of the faith amply prove that material force will never prevail against the force of ideas or the will of man | he would say |  from this effect produced by the will of all each man may draw conclusions in favor of his own | i need say nothing of his views on poetry or history nor of his judgment on the masterpieces of our language | there would be little interest in the record of opinions now almost universally held though at that time from the lips of a boy they might seem remarkable | louis was capable of the highest flights | to give a notion of his talents in a few words he could have written zadig as wittily as voltaire he could have thought out the dialogue between sylla and eucrates as powerfully as montesquieu | his rectitude of character made him desire above all else in a work that it should bear the stamp of utility at the same time his refined taste demanded novelty of thought as well as of form | one of his most remarkable literary observations which will serve as a clue to all the others and show the lucidity of his judgment is this which has ever dwelt in my memory the apocalypse is written ecstasy | he regarded the bible as a part of the traditional history of the antediluvian nations which had taken for its share the new humanity | he thought that the mythology of the greeks was borrowed both from the hebrew scriptures and from the sacred books of india adapted after their own fashion by the beauty loving hellenes |  it is impossible said he to doubt the priority of the asiatic scriptures they are earlier than our sacred books | the man who is candid enough to admit this historical fact sees the whole world expand before him | was it not on the asiatic highland that the few men took refuge who were able to escape the catastrophe that ruined our globe if indeed men had existed before that cataclysm or shock | a serious query the answer to which lies at the bottom of the sea | the anthropogony of the bible is merely a genealogy of a swarm escaping from the human hive which settled on the mountainous slopes of thibet between the summits of the himalaya and the caucasus |  the character of the primitive ideas of that horde called by its lawgiver the people of god no doubt to secure its unity and perhaps also to induce it to maintain his laws and his system of government for the books of moses are a religious political and civil code that character bears the authority of terror convulsions of nature are interpreted with stupendous power as a vengeance from on high | in fact since this wandering tribe knew none of the ease enjoyed by a community settled in a patriarchal home their sorrows as pilgrims inspired them with none but gloomy poems majestic but blood stained | in the hindoos on the contrary the spectacle of the rapid recoveries of the natural world and the prodigious effects of sunshine which they were the first to recognize gave rise to happy images of blissful love to the worship of fire and of the endless personifications of reproductive force | these fine fancies are lacking in the book of the hebrews | a constant need of self preservation amid all the dangers and the lands they traversed to reach the promised land engendered their exclusive race feeling and their hatred of all other nations |  these three scriptures are the archives of an engulfed world | therein lies the secret of the extraordinary splendor of those languages and their myths | a grand human history lies beneath those names of men and places and those fables which charm us so irresistibly we know not why | perhaps it is because we find in them the native air of renewed humanity | thus to him this threefold literature included all the thoughts of man | not a book could be written in his opinion of which the subject might not there be discerned in its germ | this view shows how learnedly he had pursued his early studies of the bible and how far they had led him | hovering as it were over the heads of society and knowing it solely from books he could judge it coldly |  the law said he never puts a check on the enterprises of the rich and great but crushes the poor who on the contrary need protection | his kind heart did not therefore allow him to sympathize in political ideas his system led rather to the passive obedience of which jesus set the example | during the last hours of my life at vendome louis had ceased to feel the spur to glory he had in a way had an abstract enjoyment of fame and having opened it as the ancient priests of sacrifice sought to read the future in the hearts of men he had found nothing in the entrails of his chimera | scorning a sentiment so wholly personal: glory said he is but beatified egoism | here perhaps before taking leave of this exceptional boyhood i may pronounce judgment on it by a rapid glance | a short time before our separation lambert said to me: apart from the general laws which i have formulated and this perhaps will be my glory laws which must be those of the human organism the life of man is movement determined in each individual by the pressure of some inscrutable influence by the brain the heart or the sinews | all the innumerable modes of human existence result from the proportions in which these three generating forces are more or less intimately combined with the substances they assimilate in the environment they live in | he stopped short struck his forehead and exclaimed: how strange | in every great man whose portrait i have remarked the neck is short | perhaps nature requires that in them the heart should be nearer to the brain | then he went on: from that a sum total of action takes its rise which constitutes social life | the man of sinew contributes action or strength the man of brain genius the man of heart faith | but he added sadly faith sees only the clouds of the sanctuary the angel alone has light | so according to his own definitions lambert was all brain and all heart | it seems to me that his intellectual life was divided into three marked phases | under the impulsion from his earliest years of a precocious activity due no doubt to some malady or to some special perfection of organism his powers were concentrated on the functions of the inner senses and a superabundant flow of nerve fluid | as a man of ideas he craved to satisfy the thirst of his brain to assimilate every idea | hence his reading and from his reading the reflections that gave him the power of reducing things to their simplest expression and of absorbing them to study them in their essence | thus the advantages of this splendid stage acquired by other men only after long study were achieved by lambert during his bodily childhood: a happy childhood colored by the studious joys of a born poet | the point which most thinkers reach at last was to him the starting point whence his brain was to set out one day in search of new worlds of knowledge | though as yet he knew it not he had made for himself the most exacting life possible and the most insatiably greedy | merely to live was he not compelled to be perpetually casting nutriment into the gulf he had opened in himself | like some beings who dwell in the grosser world might not he die of inanition for want of feeding abnormal and disappointed cravings | was not this a sort of debauchery of the intellect which might lead to spontaneous combustion like that of bodies saturated with alcohol | i had seen nothing of this first phase of his brain development it is only now at a later day that i can thus give an account of its prodigious fruit and results | lambert was now thirteen | i was so fortunate as to witness the first stage of the second period | lambert was cast into all the miseries of school life and that perhaps was his salvation it absorbed the superabundance of his thoughts | after passing from concrete ideas to their purest expression from words to their ideal import and from that import to principles after reducing everything to the abstract to enable him to live he yearned for yet other intellectual creations | quelled by the woes of school and the critical development of his physical constitution he became thoughtful dreamed of feeling and caught a glimpse of new sciences positively masses of ideas | checked in his career and not yet strong enough to contemplate the higher spheres he contemplated his inmost self | i then perceived in him the struggle of the mind reacting on itself and trying to detect the secrets of its own nature like a physician who watches the course of his own disease | at this stage of weakness and strength of childish grace and superhuman powers louis lambert is the creature who more than any other gave me a poetical and truthful image of the being we call an angel always excepting one woman whose name whose features whose identity and whose life i would fain hide from all the world so as to be sole master of the secret of her existence and to bury it in the depths of my heart | the third phase i was not destined to see | it began when lambert and i were parted for he did not leave college till he was eighteen in the summer of 1815 | he had at that time lost his father and mother about six months before | finding no member of his family with whom his soul could sympathize expansive still but since our parting thrown back on himself he made his home with his uncle who was also his guardian and who having been turned out of his benefice as a priest who had taken the oaths had come to settle at blois | there louis lived for some time but consumed ere long by the desire to finish his incomplete studies he came to paris to see madame de stael and to drink of science at its highest fount | the old priest being very fond of his nephew left louis free to spend his whole little inheritance in his three years' stay in paris though he lived very poorly | this fortune consisted of but a few thousand francs | lambert returned to blois at the beginning of 1820 driven from paris by the sufferings to which the impecunious are exposed there | he must often have been a victim to the secret storms the terrible rage of mind by which artists are tossed to judge from the only fact his uncle recollected and the only letter he preserved of all those which louis lambert wrote to him at that time perhaps because it was the last and the longest | to begin with the story | louis one evening was at the theatre francais seated on a bench in the upper gallery near to one of the pillars which in those days divided off the third row of boxes | on rising between the acts he saw a young woman who had just come into the box next him | the sight of this lady who was young pretty well dressed in a low bodice no doubt and escorted by a man for whom her face beamed with all the charms of love produced such a terrible effect on lambert's soul and senses that he was obliged to leave the theatre | if he had not been controlled by some remaining glimmer of reason which was not wholly extinguished by this first fever of burning passion he might perhaps have yielded to the most irresistible desire that came over him to kill the young man on whom the lady's looks beamed | was not this a reversion in the heart of the paris world to the savage passion that regards women as its prey an effect of animal instinct combining with the almost luminous flashes of a soul crushed under the weight of thought | in short was it not the prick of the penknife so vividly imagined by the boy felt by the man as the thunderbolt of his most vital craving for love | and now here is the letter that depicts the state of his mind as it was struck by the spectacle of parisian civilization | his feelings perpetually wounded no doubt in that whirlpool of self interest must always have suffered there he probably had no friend to comfort him no enemy to give tone to this life | compelled to live in himself alone having no one to share his subtle raptures he may have hoped to solve the problem of his destiny by a life of ecstasy adopting an almost vegetative attitude like an anchorite of the early church and abdicating the empire of the intellectual world | this letter seems to hint at such a scheme which is a temptation to all lofty souls at periods of social reform | but is not this purpose in some cases the result of a vocation | do not some of them endeavor to concentrate their powers by long silence so as to emerge fully capable of governing the world by word or by deed | louis must assuredly have found much bitterness in his intercourse with men or have striven hard with society in terrible irony without extracting anything from it before uttering so strident a cry and expressing poor fellow the desire which satiety of power and of all earthly things has led even monarchs to indulge | and perhaps too he went back to solitude to carry out some great work that was floating inchoate in his brain | we would gladly believe it as we read this fragment of his thoughts betraying the struggle of his soul at the time when youth was ending and the terrible power of production was coming into being to which we might have owed the works of the man | this letter connects itself with the adventure at the theatre | the incident and the letter throw light on each other body and soul were tuned to the same pitch | this tempest of doubts and asseverations of clouds and of lightnings that flash before the thunder ending by a starved yearning for heavenly illumination throws such a light on the third phase of his education as enables us to understand it perfectly | as we read these lines written at chance moments taken up when the vicissitudes of life in paris allowed may we not fancy that we see an oak at that stage of its growth when its inner expansion bursts the tender green bark covering it with wrinkles and cracks when its majestic stature is in preparation if indeed the lightnings of heaven and the axe of man shall spare it | this letter then will close alike for the poet and the philosopher this portentous childhood and unappreciated youth | it finishes off the outline of this nature in its germ | philosophers will regret the foliage frost nipped in the bud but they will perhaps find the flowers expanding in regions far above the highest places of the earth |  paris september october 1819 |  dear uncle i shall soon be leaving this part of the world where i could never bear to live | i find no one here who likes what i like who works at my work or is amazed at what amazes me | thrown back on myself i eat my heart out in misery | my long and patient study of society here has brought me to melancholy conclusions in which doubt predominates |  here money is the mainspring of everything | money is indispensable even for going without money | but though that dross is necessary to any one who wishes to think in peace i have not courage enough to make it the sole motive power of my thoughts | to make a fortune i must take up a profession in two words i must by acquiring some privilege of position or of self advertisement either legal or ingeniously contrived purchase the right of taking day by day out of somebody else's purse a certain sum which by the end of the year would amount to a small capital and this in twenty years would hardly secure an income of four or five thousand francs to a man who deals honestly | an advocate a notary a merchant any recognized professional has earned a living for his later days in the course of fifteen or sixteen years after ending his apprenticeship |  but i have never felt fit for work of this kind | i prefer thought to action an idea to a transaction contemplation to activity | i am absolutely devoid of the constant attention indispensable to the making of a fortune | any mercantile venture any need for using other people's money would bring me to grief and i should be ruined | though i have nothing at least at the moment i owe nothing | the man who gives his life to the achievement of great things in the sphere of intellect needs very little still though twenty sous a day would be enough i do not possess that small income for my laborious idleness | when i wish to cogitate want drives me out of the sanctuary where my mind has its being | what is to become of me |  i am not frightened at poverty | if it were not that beggars are imprisoned branded scorned i would beg to enable me to solve at my leisure the problems that haunt me | still this sublime resignation by which i might emancipate my mind through abstracting it from the body would not serve my end | i should still need money to devote myself to certain experiments | but for that i would accept the outward indigence of a sage possessed of both heaven and heart | a man need only never stoop to remain lofty in poverty | he who struggles and endures while marching on to a glorious end presents a noble spectacle but who can have the strength to fight here | we can climb cliffs but it is unendurable to remain for ever tramping the mud | everything here checks the flight of the spirit that strives towards the future |  i should not be afraid of myself in a desert cave i am afraid of myself here | in the desert i should be alone with myself undisturbed here man has a thousand wants which drag him down | you go out walking absorbed in dreams the voice of the beggar asking an alms brings you back to this world of hunger and thirst | you need money only to take a walk | your organs of sense perpetually wearied by trifles never get any rest | the poet's sensitive nerves are perpetually shocked and what ought to be his glory becomes his torment his imagination is his cruelest enemy | the injured workman the poor mother in childbed the prostitute who has fallen ill the foundling the infirm and aged even vice and crime here find a refuge and charity but the world is merciless to the inventor to the man who thinks | here everything must show an immediate and practical result | fruitless attempts are mocked at though they may lead to the greatest discoveries the deep and untiring study that demands long concentrations of every faculty is not valued here | the state might pay talent as it pays the bayonet but it is afraid of being taken in by mere cleverness as if genius could be counterfeited for any length of time |  ah my dear uncle when monastic solitude was destroyed uprooted from its home at the foot of mountains under green and silent shade asylums ought to have been provided for those suffering souls who by an idea promote the progress of nations or prepare some new and fruitful development of science |  september 20th |  the love of study brought me hither as you know | i have met really learned men amazing for the most part but the lack of unity in scientific work almost nullifies their efforts | there is no head of instruction or of scientific research | at the museum a professor argues to prove that another in the rue saint jacques talks nonsense | the lecturer at the college of medicine abuses him of the college de france | when i first arrived i went to hear an old academician who taught five hundred youths that corneille was a haughty and powerful genius racine elegiac and graceful moliere inimitable voltaire supremely witty bossuet and pascal incomparable in argument | a professor of philosophy may make a name by explaining how plato is platonic | another discourses on the history of words without troubling himself about ideas | one explains aeschylus another tells you that communes were communes and neither more nor less | these original and brilliant discoveries diluted to last several hours constitute the higher education which is to lead to giant strides in human knowledge |  if the government could have an idea i should suspect it of being afraid of any real superiority which once roused might bring society under the yoke of an intelligent rule | then nations would go too far and too fast so professors are appointed to produce simpletons | how else can we account for a scheme devoid of method or any notion of the future |  the institut might be the central government of the moral and intellectual world but it has been ruined lately by its subdivision into separate academies | so human science marches on without a guide without a system and floats haphazard with no road traced out |  this vagueness and uncertainty prevails in politics as well as in science | in the order of nature means are simple the end is grand and marvelous here in science as in government the means are stupendous the end is mean | the force which in nature proceeds at an equal pace and of which the sum is constantly being added to itself the a a from which everything is produced is destructive in society | politics at the present time place human forces in antagonism to neutralize each other instead of combining them to promote their action to some definite end |  looking at europe alone from caesar to constantine from the puny constantine to the great attila from the huns to charlemagne from charlemagne to leo x from leo x to philip ii from philip ii | to louis xiv |  from venice to england from england to napoleon from napoleon to england i see no fixed purpose in politics its constant agitation has led to no progress |  nations leave witnesses to their greatness in monuments and to their happiness in the welfare of individuals | are modern monuments as fine as those of the ancients | i doubt it | the arts which are the direct outcome of the individual the products of genius or of handicraft have not advanced much | the pleasures of lucullus were as good as those of samuel bernard of beaujon or of the king of bavaria | and then human longevity has diminished |  thus to those who will be candid man is still the same might is his only law and success his only wisdom |  jesus christ mahomet and luther only lent a different hue to the arena in which youthful nations disport themselves |  no development of politics has hindered civilization with its riches its manners its alliance of the strong against the weak its ideas and its delights from moving from memphis to tyre from tyre to baalbek from tadmor to carthage from carthage to rome from rome to constantinople from constantinople to venice from venice to spain from spain to england while no trace is left of memphis of tyre of carthage of rome of venice or madrid | the soul of those great bodies has fled | not one of them has preserved itself from destruction nor formulated this axiom: when the effect produced ceases to be in a ratio to its cause disorganization follows |  the most subtle genius can discover no common bond between great social facts | no political theory has ever lasted | governments pass away as men do without handing down any lesson and no system gives birth to a system better than that which came before it | what can we say about politics when a government directly referred to god perished in india and egypt when the rule of the sword and of the tiara are past when monarchy is dying when the government of the people has never been alive when no scheme of intellectual power as applied to material interests has ever proved durable and everything at this day remains to be done all over again as it has been at every period when man has turned to cry out 'i am in torment '|  the code which is considered napoleon's greatest achievement is the most draconian work i know of | territorial subdivision carried out to the uttermost and its principle confirmed by the equal division of property generally must result in the degeneracy of the nation and the death of the arts and sciences | the land too much broken up is cultivated only with cereals and small crops the forests and consequently the rivers are disappearing oxen and horses are no longer bred | means are lacking both for attack and for resistance | if we should be invaded the people must be crushed it has lost its mainspring its leaders | this is the history of deserts |  thus the science of politics has no definite principles and it can have no fixity it is the spirit of the hour the perpetual application of strength proportioned to the necessities of the moment | the man who should foresee two centuries ahead would die on the place of execution loaded with the imprecations of the mob or else which seems worse would be lashed with the myriad whips of ridicule | nations are but individuals neither wiser nor stronger than man and their destinies are identical | if we reflect on man is not that to consider mankind |  by studying the spectacle of society perpetually storm tossed in its foundations as well as in its results in its causes as well as in its actions while philanthropy is but a splendid mistake and progress is vanity i have been confirmed in this truth: life is within and not without us to rise above men to govern them is only the part of an aggrandized school master and those men who are capable of rising to the level whence they can enjoy a view of the world should not look at their own feet |  november 4th |  i am no doubt occupied with weighty thoughts i am on the way to certain discoveries an invincible power bears me toward a luminary which shone at an early age on the darkness of my moral life but what name can i give to the power that ties my hands and shuts my mouth and drags me in a direction opposite to my vocation | i must leave paris bid farewell to the books in the libraries those noble centres of illumination those kindly and always accessible sages and the younger geniuses with whom i sympathize | who is it that drives me away | chance or providence |  the two ideas represented by those words are irreconcilable | if chance does not exist we must admit fatalism that is to say the compulsory co ordination of things under the rule of a general plan | why then do we rebel | if man is not free what becomes of the scaffolding of his moral sense | or if he can control his destiny if by his own freewill he can interfere with the execution of the general plan what becomes of god |  why did i come here | if i examine myself i find the answer: i find in myself axioms that need developing | but why then have i such vast faculties without being suffered to use them | if my suffering could serve as an example i could understand it but no i suffer unknown |  this is perhaps as much the act of providence as the fate of the flower that dies unseen in the heart of the virgin forest where no one can enjoy its perfume or admire its splendor | just as that blossom vainly sheds its fragrance to the solitude so do i here in the garret give birth to ideas that no one can grasp |  yesterday evening i sat eating bread and grapes in front of my window with a young doctor named meyraux | we talked as men do whom misfortune has joined in brotherhood and i said to him: 'i am going away you are staying | take up my ideas and develop them '|  'i cannot '| said he with bitter regret: 'my feeble health cannot stand so much work and i shall die young of my struggle with penury '|  we looked up at the sky and grasped hands | we first met at the comparative anatomy course and in the galleries of the museum attracted thither by the same study the unity of geological structure | in him this was the presentiment of genius sent to open a new path in the fallows of intellect in me it was a deduction from a general system |  my point is to ascertain the real relation that may exist between god and man | is not this a need of the age | without the highest assurance it is impossible to put bit and bridle on the social factions that have been let loose by the spirit of scepticism and discussion and which are now crying aloud: 'show us a way in which we may walk and find no pitfalls in our way '|  you will wonder what comparative anatomy has to do with a question of such importance to the future of society | must we not attain to the conviction that man is the end of all earthly means before we ask whether he too is not the means to some end | if man is bound up with everything is there not something above him with which he again is bound up | if he is the end all of the explained transmutations that lead up to him must he not be also the link between the visible and invisible creations |  the activity of the universe is not absurd it must tend to an end and that end is surely not a social body constituted as ours is | there is a fearful gulf between us and heaven | in our present existence we can neither be always happy nor always in torment must there not be some tremendous change to bring about paradise and hell two images without which god cannot exist to the mind of the vulgar | i know that a compromise was made by the invention of the soul but it is repugnant to me to make god answerable for human baseness for our disenchantments our aversions our degeneracy |  again how can we recognize as divine the principle within us which can be overthrown by a few glasses of rum | how conceive of immaterial faculties which matter can conquer and whose exercise is suspended by a grain of opium | how imagine that we shall be able to feel when we are bereft of the vehicles of sensation | why must god perish if matter can be proved to think | is the vitality of matter in its innumerable manifestations the effect of its instincts at all more explicable than the effects of the mind | is not the motion given to the worlds enough to prove god's existence without our plunging into absurd speculations suggested by pride | and if we pass after our trials from a perishable state of being to a higher existence is not that enough for a creature that is distinguished from other creatures only by more perfect instincts | if in moral philosophy there is not a single principle which does not lead to the absurd or cannot be disproved by evidence is it not high time that we should set to work to seek such dogmas as are written in the innermost nature of things | must we not reverse philosophical science |  we trouble ourselves very little about the supposed void that must have pre existed for us and we try to fathom the supposed void that lies before us | we make god responsible for the future but we do not expect him to account for the past | and yet it is quite as desirable to know whether we have any roots in the past as to discover whether we are inseparable from the future |  we have been deists or atheists in one direction only |  is the world eternal | was the world created | we can conceive of no middle term between these two propositions one then is true and the other false | take your choice | whichever it may be god as our reason depicts him must be deposed and that amounts to denial | the world is eternal: then beyond question god has had it forced upon him | the world was created: then god is an impossibility | how could he have subsisted through an eternity not knowing that he would presently want to create the world | how could he have failed to foresee all the results |  whence did he derive the essence of creation | evidently from himself | if then the world proceeds from god how can you account for evil | that evil should proceed from good is absurd | if evil does not exist what do you make of social life and its laws | on all hands we find a precipice | on every side a gulf in which reason is lost | then social science must be altogether reconstructed |  listen to me uncle until some splendid genius shall have taken account of the obvious inequality of intellects and the general sense of humanity the word god will be constantly arraigned and society will rest on shifting sands | the secret of the various moral zones through which man passes will be discovered by the analysis of the animal type as a whole | that animal type has hitherto been studied with reference only to its differences not to its similitudes in its organic manifestations not in its faculties | animal faculties are perfected in direct transmission in obedience to laws which remain to be discovered | these faculties correspond to the forces which express them and those forces are essentially material and divisible |  material faculties | reflect on this juxtaposition of words | is not this a problem as insoluble as that of the first communication of motion to matter an unsounded gulf of which the difficulties were transposed rather than removed by newton's system | again the universal assimilation of light by everything that exists on earth demands a new study of our globe | the same animal differs in the tropics of india and in the north | under the angular or the vertical incidence of the sun's rays nature is developed the same but not the same identical in its principles but totally dissimilar in its outcome | the phenomenon that amazes our eyes in the zoological world when we compare the butterflies of brazil with those of europe is even more startling in the world of mind | a particular facial angle a certain amount of brain convolutions are indispensable to produce columbus raphael napoleon laplace or beethoven the sunless valley produces the cretin draw your own conclusions | why such differences due to the more or less ample diffusion of light to men | the masses of suffering humanity more or less active fed and enlightened are a difficulty to be accounted for crying out against god |  why in great joy do we always want to quit the earth | whence comes the longing to rise which every creature has known or will know | motion is a great soul and its alliance with matter is just as difficult to account for as the origin of thought in man | in these days science is one it is impossible to touch politics independent of moral questions and these are bound up with scientific questions | it seems to me that we are on the eve of a great human struggle the forces are there only i do not see the general |  november 25 |  believe me dear uncle it is hard to give up the life that is in us without a pang | i am returning to blois with a heavy grip at my heart i shall die then taking with me some useful truths | no personal interest debases my regrets | is earthly fame a guerdon to those who believe that they will mount to a higher sphere |  i am by no means in love with the two syllables lam and bert whether spoken with respect or with contempt over my grave they can make no change in my ultimate destiny | i feel myself strong and energetic i might become a power i feel in myself a life so luminous that it might enlighten a world and yet i am shut up in a sort of mineral as perhaps indeed are the colors you admire on the neck of an indian bird | i should need to embrace the whole world to clasp and re create it but those who have done this who have thus embraced and remoulded it began did they not by being a wheel in the machine | i can only be crushed | mahomet had the sword jesus had the cross i shall die unknown | i shall be at blois for a day and then in my coffin |  do you know why i have come back to swedenborg after vast studies of all religions and after proving to myself by reading all the works published within the last sixty years by the patient english by germany and by france how deeply true were my youthful views about the bible | swedenborg undoubtedly epitomizes all the religions or rather the one religion of humanity | though forms of worship are infinitely various neither their true meaning nor their metaphysical interpretation has ever varied | in short man has and has had but one religion |  sivaism vishnuism and brahmanism the three primitive creeds originating as they did in thibet in the valley of the indus and on the vast plains of the ganges ended their warfare some thousand years before the birth of christ by adopting the hindoo trimourti | the trimourti is our trinity | from this dogma magianism arose in persia in egypt the african beliefs and the mosaic law the worship of the cabiri and the polytheism of greece and rome | while by this ramification of the trimourti the asiatic myths became adapted to the imaginations of various races in the lands they reached by the agency of certain sages whom men elevated to be demi gods mithra bacchus hermes hercules and the rest buddha the great reformer of the three primeval religions lived in india and founded his church there a sect which still numbers two hundred millions more believers than christianity can show while it certainly influenced the powerful will both of jesus and of confucius |  then christianity raised her standard | subsequently mahomet fused judaism and christianity the bible and the gospel in one book the koran adapting them to the apprehension of the arab race | finally swedenborg borrowed from magianism brahmanism buddhism and christian mysticism all the truth and divine beauty that those four great religious books hold in common and added to them a doctrine a basis of reasoning that may be termed mathematical |  any man who plunges into these religious waters of which the sources are not all known will find proofs that zoroaster moses buddha confucius jesus christ and swedenborg had identical principles and aimed at identical ends |  the last of them all swedenborg will perhaps be the buddha of the north | obscure and diffuse as his writings are we find in them the elements of a magnificent conception of society | his theocracy is sublime and his creed is the only acceptable one to superior souls | he alone brings man into immediate communion with god he gives a thirst for god he has freed the majesty of god from the trappings in which other human dogmas have disguised him | he left him where he is making his myriad creations and creatures gravitate towards him through successive transformations which promise a more immediate and more natural future than the catholic idea of eternity | swedenborg has absolved god from the reproach attaching to him in the estimation of tender souls for the perpetuity of revenge to punish the sin of a moment a system of injustice and cruelty |  each man may know for himself what hope he has of life eternal and whether this world has any rational sense | i mean to make the attempt | and this attempt may save the world just as much as the cross at jerusalem or the sword at mecca | these were both the offspring of the desert | of the thirty three years of christ's life we only know the history of nine his life of seclusion prepared him for his life of glory | and i too crave for the desert | notwithstanding the difficulties of the task i have felt it my duty to depict lambert's boyhood the unknown life to which i owe the only happy hours the only pleasant memories of my early days | excepting during those two years i had nothing but annoyances and weariness | though some happiness was mine at a later time it was always incomplete | i have been diffuse i know but in default of entering into the whole wide heart and brain of louis lambert two words which inadequately express the infinite aspects of his inner life it would be almost impossible to make the second part of his intellectual history intelligible a phase that was unknown to the world and to me but of which the mystical outcome was made evident to my eyes in the course of a few hours | those who have not already dropped this volume will i hope understand the events i still have to tell forming as they do a sort of second existence lived by this creature may i not say this creation in whom everything was to be so extraordinary even his end | when louis returned to blois his uncle was eager to procure him some amusement but the poor priest was regarded as a perfect leper in that godly minded town | no one would have anything to say to a revolutionary who had taken the oaths | his society therefore consisted of a few individuals of what were then called liberal or patriotic or constitutional opinions on whom he would call for a rubber of whist or of boston | at the first house where he was introduced by his uncle louis met a young lady whose circumstances obliged her to remain in this circle so contemned by those of the fashionable world though her fortune was such as to make it probable that she might by and by marry into the highest aristocracy of the province | mademoiselle pauline de villenoix was sole heiress to the wealth amassed by her grandfather a jew named salomon who contrary to the customs of his nation had in his old age married a christian and a catholic | he had only one son who was brought up in his mother's faith | at his father's death young salomon purchased what was known at that time as a savonnette a vilain literally a cake of soap for a serf a small estate called villenoix which he contrived to get registered with a baronial title and took its name | he died unmarried but he left a natural daughter to whom he bequeathed the greater part of his fortune including the lands of villenoix | he appointed one of his uncles monsieur joseph salomon to be the girl's guardian | the old jew was so devoted to his ward that he seemed willing to make great sacrifices for the sake of marrying her well | but mademoiselle de villenoix's birth and the cherished prejudice against jews that prevails in the provinces would not allow of her being received in the very exclusive circle which rightly or wrongly considers itself noble notwithstanding her own large fortune and her guardian's | monsieur joseph salomon was resolved that if she could not secure a country squire his niece should go to paris and make choice of a husband among the peers of france liberal or monarchical as to happiness that he believed he could secure her by the terms of the marriage contract | mademoiselle de villenoix was now twenty | her remarkable beauty and gifts of mind were surer guarantees of happiness than those offered by money | her features were of the purest type of jewish beauty the oval lines so noble and maidenly have an indescribable stamp of the ideal and seem to speak of the joys of the east its unchangeably blue sky the glories of its lands and the fabulous riches of life there | she had fine eyes shaded by deep eyelids fringed with thick curled lashes | biblical innocence sat on her brow | her complexion was of the pure whiteness of the levite's robe | she was habitually silent and thoughtful but her movements and gestures betrayed a quiet grace as her speech bore witness to a woman's sweet and loving nature | she had not indeed the rosy freshness the fruit like bloom which blush on a girl's cheek during her careless years | darker shadows with here and there a redder vein took the place of color symptomatic of an energetic temper and nervous irritability such as many men do not like to meet with in a wife while to others they are an indication of the most sensitive chastity and passion mingled with pride | as soon as louis saw mademoiselle de villenoix he discerned the angel within | the richest powers of his soul and his tendency to ecstatic reverie every faculty within him was at once concentrated in boundless love the first love of a young man a passion which is strong indeed in all but which in him was raised to incalculable power by the perennial ardor of his senses the character of his ideas and the manner in which he lived | this passion became a gulf into which the hapless fellow threw everything a gulf whither the mind dare not venture since his flexible and firm as it was was lost there | there all was mysterious for everything went on in that moral world closed to most men whose laws were revealed to him perhaps to his sorrow | when an accident threw me in the way of his uncle the good man showed me into the room which lambert had at that time lived in | i wanted to find some vestiges of his writings if he should have left any | there among his papers untouched by the old man from that fine instinct of grief that characterized the aged i found a number of letters too illegible ever to have been sent to mademoiselle de villenoix | my familiarity with lambert's writing enabled me in time to decipher the hieroglyphics of this shorthand the result of impatience and a frenzy of passion | carried away by his feelings he had written without being conscious of the irregularity of words too slow to express his thoughts | he must have been compelled to copy these chaotic attempts for the lines often ran into each other but he was also afraid perhaps of not having sufficiently disguised his feelings and at first at any rate he had probably written his love letters twice over | it required all the fervency of my devotion to his memory and the sort of fanaticism which comes of such a task to enable me to divine and restore the meaning of the five letters that here follow | these documents preserved by me with pious care are the only material evidence of his overmastering passion | mademoiselle de villenoix had no doubt destroyed the real letters that she received eloquent witnesses to the delirium she inspired | the first of these papers evidently a rough sketch betrays by its style and by its length the many emendations the heartfelt alarms the innumerable terrors caused by a desire to please the changes of expression and the hesitation between the whirl of ideas that beset a man as he indites his first love letter a letter he never will forget each line the result of a reverie each word the subject of long cogitation while the most unbridled passion known to man feels the necessity of the most reserved utterance and like a giant stooping to enter a hovel speaks humbly and low so as not to alarm a girl's soul | no antiquary ever handled his palimpsests with greater respect than i showed in reconstructing these mutilated documents of such joy and suffering as must always be sacred to those who have known similar joy and grief | i mademoiselle when you have read this letter if you ever should read it my life will be in your hands for i love you and to me the hope of being loved is life | others perhaps ere now have in speaking of themselves misused the words i must employ to depict the state of my soul yet i beseech you to believe in the truth of my expressions though weak they are sincere | perhaps i ought not thus to proclaim my love | indeed my heart counseled me to wait in silence till my passion should touch you that i might the better conceal it if its silent demonstrations should displease you or till i could express it even more delicately than in words if i found favor in your eyes | however after having listened for long to the coy fears that fill a youthful heart with alarms i write in obedience to the instinct which drags useless lamentations from the dying |  it has needed all my courage to silence the pride of poverty and to overleap the barriers which prejudice erects between you and me | i have had to smother many reflections to love you in spite of your wealth and as i write to you am i not in danger of the scorn which women often reserve for profession of love which they accept only as one more tribute of flattery | but we cannot help rushing with all our might towards happiness or being attracted to the life of love as a plant is to the light we must have been very unhappy before we can conquer the torment the anguish of those secret deliberations when reason proves to us by a thousand arguments how barren our yearning must be if it remains buried in our hearts and when hopes bid us dare everything |  i was happy when i admired you in silence i was so lost in the contemplation of your beautiful soul that only to see you left me hardly anything further to imagine | and i should not now have dared to address you if i had not heard that you were leaving | what misery has that one word brought upon me | indeed it is my despair that has shown me the extent of my attachment it is unbounded | mademoiselle you will never know at least i hope you may never know the anguish of dreading lest you should lose the only happiness that has dawned on you on earth the only thing that has thrown a gleam of light in the darkness of misery | i understood yesterday that my life was no more in myself but in you | there is but one woman in the world for me as there is but one thought in my soul | i dare not tell you to what a state i am reduced by my love for you | i would have you only as a gift from yourself i must therefore avoid showing myself to you in all the attractiveness of dejection for is it not often more impressive to a noble soul than that of good fortune | there are many things i may not tell you | indeed i have too lofty a notion of love to taint it with ideas that are alien to its nature | if my soul is worthy of yours and my life pure your heart will have a sympathetic insight and you will understand me |  it is the fate of man to offer himself to the woman who can make him believe in happiness but it is your prerogative to reject the truest passion if it is not in harmony with the vague voices in your heart that i know | if my lot as decided by you must be adverse to my hopes mademoiselle let me appeal to the delicacy of your maiden soul and the ingenuous compassion of a woman to burn my letter | on my knees i beseech you to forget all | do not mock at a feeling that is wholly respectful and that is too deeply graven on my heart ever to be effaced | break my heart but do not rend it | let the expression of my first love a pure and youthful love be lost in your pure and youthful heart | let it die there as a prayer rises up to die in the bosom of god |  i owe you much gratitude: i have spent delicious hours occupied in watching you and giving myself up to the faint dreams of my life do not crush these long but transient joys by some girlish irony | be satisfied not to answer me | at the christmas holidays of 1500 it was publicly stated that she was to marry the duke of gravina an orsini who undeterred by the fate of lucretia's former husbands came to rome in december to sue for her hand | some hope was held out to him probably with a view to retaining the friendship of his family | alexander himself conceived the plan of marrying lucretia to alfonso of ferrara | he desired this alliance both on his beloved daughter's account and because it could not fail to prove advantageous to c sar it would not only assure to him the possession of romagna which venice might try to wrest from him but it would also increase his chances of consummating his plans regarding bologna and florence | at the same time it would bring to him the support of the dynasties of mantua and urbino which were connected by marriage with the house of ferrara | it would be the nucleus of a great league including france the papacy c sar's states ferrara mantua and urbino which would be sufficiently strong to defend alexander and his house against all enemies | if the king of france was to maintain his position in italy he would require above all else the help of the pope | he already occupied milan and he wished to seize half of the kingdom of naples and hold it as a vassal of the church for france and spain had already agreed upon the wicked partition of naples to which alexander had thus far neither refused nor given his consent | in order to win over the duke of ferrara to his bold scheme alexander availed himself first of all of giambattista ferrari of modena an old retainer of ercole who was wholly devoted to the pope and whom he had made datarius and subsequently a cardinal | ferrari ventured to suggest the marriage to the duke on account so he wrote him of the great advantage which would accrue to his state from it |  84 this proposal caused ercole no less embarrassment than king federico of naples had felt when he was placed in a similar position | his pride rebelled | his daughter the noble marchioness isabella of mantua and her sister in law elisabetta of urbino were literally beside themselves | the youthful alfonso objected most vigorously | moreover there was a plan afoot to marry the hereditary duke to a princess of the royal house of france louise widow of the duke of angoul me |  85 ercole rejected the offer absolutely | alexander had foreseen his opposition but he felt sure he could overcome it | he had the advantages of the alliance pointed out more clearly and also the disadvantages which might result from a refusal on one hand was ferrara's safety and advancement and on the other the hostility of c sar and the pope and perhaps also that of france |  86 alexander was so certain of his victory that he made no secret of the projected marriage and he even spoke of it with satisfaction in the consistory as if it were an accomplished fact |  87 he succeeded in winning the support of the french court which however was not difficult as louis xii was then very anxious for the pope to allow him to lead his army out of tuscany through the states of the church into naples which he could not do without the secret consent of his holiness | above all the pope counted on the help of cardinal amboise to whom c sar had taken the red hat when he went to france and whose ambitious glances were directed toward the papal throne which with the aid of his friend c sar and of the spanish cardinals he hoped to reach on the death of alexander | it is nevertheless a fact that louis xii at first was opposed to the match and even endeavored to prevent it | he himself was not only determinedly set against everything which would increase the power of c sar and the pope but he was also anxious to enhance his own influence with ferrara by bringing about the marriage of alfonso and some french princess | in may alexander sent a secretary to france to induce the king to use his influence to effect the alliance but this louis declined to do |  88 on the other hand he was anxious to bring about the marriage of don ferrante alfonso's brother with lucretia and secure for her as portion the territory of piombino |  89 he had also placed a check on c sar's operations in central italy in consequence of which the latter's attempts against bologna and florence had miscarried | the whole scheme for the marriage would have fallen through if the subject of the french expedition against naples had not just then come up | there is ground for believing that the pope's consent was made contingent upon the king's agreeing to the marriage | june 13 1501 c sar himself now created duke of romagna by his father came secretly to rome where he remained three weeks exerting all his efforts to further the plan | after this he and his men at arms followed the french marshal aubigny who had set out from near rome for naples to engage in a nefarious war of conquest whose horrors in the briefest of time overwhelmed the house of aragon | as early as june the king of france yielded to the pope's solicitations and exerted his influence in ferrara as appears from a despatch of the ferrarese ambassador to france dated june 22d | he reported to ercole that he had stated to the king that the pope threatened to deprive the duke of his domain if he did not consent to the marriage whereupon the king replied that ferrara was under his protection and could fall only when france fell | the envoy feared that the pope might avail himself of the question of the investiture of naples upon which the king was determined to win him over to his side | he finally wrote the duke that monsignor de trans the most influential person at the king's court had advised him to agree to the marriage upon the conditional payment of two hundred thousand ducats the remission of ferrara's annual dues and certain benefices for the house of este |  90 amboise sent the archbishop of narbonne and other agents to ferrara to win over the duke the king of france himself wrote and urged him to give his consent and he now refused don alfonso the hand of the french princess | while the french ambassador was presenting his case to the duke the pope's messengers and c sar's agents were also endeavoring to secure his consent | caught in a network of intrigue fear at last forced ercole to yield | july 8th he had louis xii notified that he would do as he wished if he and the pope could agree upon the conditions |  91 he yielded only to the demand of the king who advised the marriage solely because he himself had need of the pope | all the while he was urging ercole to give his consent he was also counselling him not to be in too great haste to send his son don ferrante to rome to conclude the matter but to hold him back as long as possible until he himself should reach lombardy which would be in september | he even had ercole informed that he would keep his promise to bestow the hand of madonna d'angoul me on don alfonso and he made no effort to conceal the displeasure he felt on account of the projected alliance with lucretia |  92 to the ferrarese ambassador he remarked that he would consider the duke unwise if he allowed his son to marry the daughter of the pope for on alexander's death he would no longer know with whom he had concluded the alliance and alfonso's position would become very uncertain |  93 the duke did not hurry it is true he sent his secretary hector bellingeri to rome but only for the purpose of telling the pope that he had yielded to the king's wishes upon the condition that his own demands would be satisfied | the pope and c sar however urged that the marriage contract be executed at once and they requested the cardinal of rouen who was then in milan to induce ercole to send his son alfonso there to milan so that the transaction might be concluded in the cardinal's presence | this the duke refused to do until the pope agreed to the conditions upon which he had based his consent |  94 while these shameful negotiations regarding lucretia were dragging on c sar was in naples and was the instrument and witness of the sudden overthrow of the hated house of aragon whose throne however was not to fall to his portion | alexander used this opportunity to appropriate the property of the barons of latium especially that of the colonna the savelli and estouteville all of which owing to the neapolitan war had been left without protection | the confiscation of this property was as we shall soon see part of the scheme which included the marriage | as early as june 1501 he had taken possession of a number of cities belonging to these families | alexander accompanied by troops horse and foot soldiers went to sermoneta july 27th | this was the time that just before his departure he made lucretia his representative in the vatican | following are burchard's words: before his holiness our master left the city he turned over the palace and all the business affairs to his daughter lucretia authorizing her to open all letters which should come addressed to him | in important matters she was to ask advice of the cardinal of lisbon |  when a certain matter came up i do not know just what it was it is said lucretia went to the above named cardinal and informed him of the pope's instructions and laid the matter before him | thereupon he said to her that whenever the pope had anything to submit to the consistory the vice chancellor or some other cardinal in his stead would write it down together with the opinions of those present therefore some one should now record what is said | lucretia replied 'i can write very well '| 'where is your pen '| asked the cardinal | lucretia saw that he was joking and she laughed and thus their conference had a fit ending | what a scene for the vatican | a young and beautiful woman the pope's own daughter presiding over the cardinals in consistory | this one scene is sufficient to show to what depths the church of rome had sunk it is more convincing than a thousand satires than a thousand official reports | the affairs which the pope entrusted to his daughter were at least so we assume wholly secular and not ecclesiastical but this bold proceeding was entirely unprecedented | the prominence given lucretia the highest proof of favor her father could show her was due to special reasons | alexander had just been assured of the consent of alfonso d'este to the marriage with lucretia and in his joy he made her regent in the vatican | this was to show that he recognized in her the prospective duchess of ferrara a person of weight in the politics of the peninsula | in doing this he was simply imitating the example of ercole and other princes who were accustomed when absent from their domains to confide state business to the women of their families | the duke had found it difficult to overcome his son's objections for nothing could offend the young prince so deeply as the determination to compel him to marry lucretia not because she was an illegitimate child for this blot signified little in that age when bastards flourished in all latin countries | many of the ruling dynasties of italy bore this stain the sforza the malatesta the bentivoglio and the aragonese of naples even the brilliant borso the first duke of ferrara was the illegitimate brother of his successor ercole | lucretia however was the daughter of a pope the child of a priest and this in the eyes of the este constituted her disgrace | neither her father's licentiousness nor c sar's crimes could have greatly affected the moral sense of the court of ferrara but not one of the princely houses of that age was so depraved that it was indifferent to the reputation of a woman destined to become one of its prominent members | alfonso was the prospective husband of a young woman whose career although she was only twenty one years of age had been most extraordinary | twice had lucretia been legally betrothed twice had she been married and twice had she been made a widow by the wickedness or crimes of others | her reputation consequently was bad therefore alfonso himself a man of the world never could feel sure of this young woman's virtue even if he did not believe all the reports which were circulated regarding her | the scandalous gossip about everything which takes place at court passed from city to city just as quickly then as it does now | the duke and his son were informed by their agents of everything which actually occurred in the borgia family as well as of every story which was started concerning its members | the frightful reasons which the disgraced sforza had given lucretia's father in writing as grounds for the annulment of his marriage were at once communicated to the duke in ferrara | the following year his agent in venice informed him that a report had come from rome that the pope's daughter had given birth to an illegitimate child |  95 moreover all the satires with which the enemies of the borgias persecuted them including lucretia were well known at the court of ferrara and doubtless maliciously enjoyed | are we warranted in assuming that the este considered these reports and satires as really well founded and yet overcame their scruples sufficiently to receive a thais into their house when they would have incurred much less danger by following the example of federico of naples who had persisted in refusing his daughter's hand to c sar borgia | it is now time to investigate the charges which were made against lucretia and in view of what roscoe and others have already proved this will not occupy us long | the number of accusers among her contemporaries certainly is not small | the following to name only the most important charged her explicitly or by implication with incest: the poets sannazzaro and pontanus and the historians and statesmen matarazzo marcus attilius alexis petrus martyr priuli macchiavelli and guicciardini and their opinions have been constantly reiterated down to the present time | on the other side we have her eulogists among her contemporaries and their successors | here it should be noted that lucretia's accusers and their charges can refer only to the roman period of her life while her admirers appear only in the second epoch when she was duchess of ferrara | among the latter are men who are no less famous than her accusers: tito and ercole strozzi bembo aldo manuzio tebaldeo ariosto all the chroniclers of ferrara and the french biographer bayard | all these bore witness to the uprightness of her life while in ferrara but of her career in rome they knew nothing | lucretia's advocate therefore can offer only negative proofs of her virtue | even making allowance for the courtier's flattery we are warranted in assuming that upright men like aldo bembo and ariosto could never have been so shameless as to pronounce a woman the ideal character of her day if they had believed her guilty or even capable of the hideous crimes with which she had been charged only a short time before | among lucretia's accusers only those who were actual witnesses of her life in rome are worthy of attention and guicciardini her bitterest enemy is not of this number | the verdicts of all later writers however have been based upon his opinion of lucretia because of his fame as a statesman and historian | he himself made up his estimate from current gossip or from the satires of pontanus and sannazzaro two poets who lived in naples and not in rome | their epigrams merely show that they were inspired by a deep seated hatred of alexander and c sar who had wrought the overthrow of the aragonese dynasty and further with what crimes men were ready to credit evil doers | the words of burchard who was a daily witness of everything that occurred in the vatican must be considered as of much greater weight | against him in particular has the spleen of the papists been directed for by them his writings are regarded as the poisonous source from which the enemies of the papacy especially the protestants have derived material for their slanders regarding alexander vi | their anger may readily be explained for burchard's diary is the only work written in rome with the exception of that of infessura which breaks off abruptly at the beginning of 1494 which treats of alexander's court moreover it possesses an official character | those however who attempt to palliate the doings of the papacy would feel less hatred for burchard if they were acquainted with the reports of the venetian envoys and the despatches of innumerable other ambassadors which have been used in this work | burchard is absolutely free from malice making no mention whatever of alexander's private conduct | he records only facts never rumors and these he glosses over or cloaks diplomatically | the venetian ambassador polo capello reports how c sar borgia stabbed the chamberlain perotto through the pope's robe but burchard makes no mention of the fact | the same ambassador explicitly states as does also a ferrarese agent that c sar killed his brother gandia burchard however utters not a word concerning the subject |  96 nor does he say anything about the way c sar despatched his brother in law alfonso |  and yet no you are the angel woman there will always be a greater charm in the expression of your feelings more harmony in your voice more grace in your smile more purity in your looks than in mine | let me feel that you are the creature of a higher sphere than that i live in it will be your pride to have descended from it mine that i should have deserved you and you will not perhaps have fallen too far by coming down to me in my poverty and misery | nay if a woman's most glorious refuge is in a heart that is wholly her own you will always reign supreme in mine | not a thought not a deed shall ever pollute this heart this glorious sanctuary so long as you vouchsafe to dwell in it and will you not dwell in it for ever | did you not enchant me by the words 'now and for ever '| nunc et semper | and i have written these words of our ritual below your portrait words worthy of you as they are of god | he is nunc et semper as my love is |  never no never can i exhaust that which is immense infinite unbounded and such is the feeling i have for you i have imagined its immeasurable extent as we measure space by the dimensions of one of its parts | i have had ineffable joys whole hours filled with delicious meditation as i have recalled a single gesture or the tone of a word of yours | thus there will be memories of which the magnitude will overpower me if the reminiscence of a sweet and friendly interview is enough to make me shed tears of joy to move and thrill my soul and to be an inexhaustible wellspring of gladness | love is the life of angels |  i can never i believe exhaust my joy in seeing you | this rapture the least fervid of any though it never can last long enough has made me apprehend the eternal contemplation in which seraphs and spirits abide in the presence of god nothing can be more natural if from his essence there emanates a light as fruitful of new emotions as that of your eyes is of your imposing brow and your beautiful countenance the image of your soul | then the soul our second self whose pure form can never perish makes our love immortal | i would there were some other language than that i use to express to you the ever new ecstasy of my love but since there is one of our own creating since our looks are living speech must we not meet face to face to read in each other's eyes those questions and answers from the heart that are so living so penetrating that one evening you could say to me 'be silent '| when i was not speaking | do you remember it dear life |  when i am away from you in the darkness of absence am i not reduced to use human words too feeble to express heavenly feelings | but words at any rate represent the marks these feelings leave in my soul just as the word god imperfectly sums up the notions we form of that mysterious first cause | but in spite of the subtleties and infinite variety of language i have no words that can express to you the exquisite union by which my life is merged into yours whenever i think of you |  and with what word can i conclude when i cease writing to you and yet do not part from you | what can farewell mean unless in death | but is death a farewell | would not my spirit be then more closely one with yours |ah  my first and last thought formerly i offered you my heart and life on my knees now what fresh blossoms of feelings can i discover in my soul that i have not already given you | it would be a gift of a part of what is wholly yours |  are you my future | how deeply i regret the past | i would i could have back all the years that are ours no more and give them to you to reign over as you do over my present life | what indeed was that time when i knew you not | it would be a void but that i was so wretched |fragment   beloved angel how delightful last evening was | how full of riches your dear heart is | and is your love endless like mine | each word brought me fresh joy and each look made it deeper | the placid expression of your countenance gave our thoughts a limitless horizon | it was all as infinite as the sky and as bland as its blue | the refinement of your adored features repeated itself by some inexplicable magic in your pretty movements and your least gestures | i knew that you were all graciousness all love but i did not know how variously graceful you could be | everything combined to urge me to tender solicitation to make me ask the first kiss that a woman always refuses no doubt that it may be snatched from her | you dear soul of my life will never guess beforehand what you may grant to my love and will yield perhaps without knowing it | you are utterly true and obey your heart alone |  the sweet tones of your voice blended with the tender harmonies that filled the quiet air the cloudless sky | not a bird piped not a breeze whispered solitude you and i the motionless leaves did not quiver in the beautiful sunset hues which are both light and shadow | you felt that heavenly poetry you who experienced so many various emotions and who so often raised your eyes to heaven to avoid answering me | you who are proud and saucy humble and masterful who give yourself to me so completely in spirit and in thought and evade the most bashful caress | dear witcheries of the heart | they ring in my ears they sound and play there still | sweet words but half spoken like a child's speech neither promise nor confession but allowing love to cherish its fairest hopes without fear or torment | how pure a memory for life | what a free blossoming of all the flowers that spring from the soul which a mere trifle can blight but which at that moment everything warmed and expanded |  and it will always be so will it not my beloved | as i recall this morning the fresh and living delights revealed to me in that hour i am conscious of a joy which makes me conceive of true love as an ocean of everlasting and ever new experiences into which we may plunge with increasing delight | every day every word every kiss every glance must increase it by its tribute of past happiness | hearts that are large enough never to forget must live every moment in their past joys as much as in those promised by the future | the remains of the castle palace and all the outer walls are covered with thick ivy | time has spared nothing but the two great towers | on the side toward the city the ruined stronghold is entered through a gateway above which is inscribed in the fair characters of the renaissance ysv vnicvs cvstos | procvl hinc timores |ysv  this leads into a rectangular court surrounded by walls now in ruins | the beholder is confronted by the fa ade of the castle a two storied structure in the style of the renaissance with windows whose casements are made of peperino cement | the inscription p loisivs far dvx primvs castri on the door frame shows that this was also the work of the farnese | the interior is a mass of ruins all the walls having fallen in | this notable monument of the past has been suffered to go to decay it was only eighty years ago that the walls of the last remaining salon fell in | the only room left is an upper chamber reached by climbing a ladder | the place where the hearth was is still discernible as is also the paneled ceiling found in so many of the buildings of the early renaissance | the ends of the rafters are supported by beautifully carved consoles | all the woodwork is stained dark brown and here and there on the ceiling are wooden shields on which are painted the borgia arms in colors | in various places in the interior and also without on the towers of the stronghold the same arms may be seen carved in stone | there are also two stones with the arms very carefully chiseled set in the walls of the entrance hall of the town house of nepi which were originally in the castle where they had been placed by lucretia's orders | the borgia arms and those of the house of aragon which lucretia as duchess of biselli had adopted are united under a ducal crown | lonely nepi which now has only 2 500 inhabitants had but few more in the year 1500 | it was a little town in campagna whose streets were bordered by gothic buildings with a few old palaces and towers belonging to the nobles among the most important of whom were the celsi | there is a small public square formerly the forum on which the town hall faces and also an old church originally built upon the ruins of the temple of jupiter | there were a few other ancient churches and cloisters such as s vito and s eleuterio and other remains of antiquity which have now disappeared | i love you with every kind of love in one | the grace of your least gesture is always new to me | i fancy i could spend whole nights breathing your breath i would i could steal into every detail of your life be the very substance of your thoughts be your very self |  well we shall at any rate never part again | no human alloy shall ever disturb our love infinite in its phases and as pure as all things are which are one our love vast as the sea vast as the sky | you are mine | all mine | i may look into the depths of your eyes to read the sweet soul that alternately hides and shines there to anticipate your wishes |  my best beloved listen to some things i have never yet dared to tell you but which i may confess to you now | i felt a certain bashfulness of soul which hindered the full expression of my feelings so i strove to shroud them under the garbs of thoughts | but now i long to lay my heart bare before you to tell you of the ardor of my dreams to reveal the boiling demands of my senses excited no doubt by the solitude in which i have lived perpetually fired by conceptions of happiness and aroused by you so fair in form so attractive in manner | how can i express to you my thirst for the unknown rapture of possessing an adored wife a rapture to which the union of two souls by love must give frenzied intensity | yes my pauline i have sat for hours in a sort of stupor caused by the violence of my passionate yearning lost in the dream of a caress as though in a bottomless abyss | at such moments my whole vitality my thoughts and powers are merged and united in what i must call desire for lack of a word to express that nameless delirium |  and i may confess to you now that one day when i would not take your hand when you offered it so sweetly an act of melancholy prudence that made you doubt my love i was in one of those fits of madness when a man could commit a murder to possess a woman | yes if i had felt the exquisite pressure you offered me as vividly as i heard your voice in my heart i know not to what lengths my passion might not have carried me | but i can be silent and suffer a great deal | why speak of this anguish when my visions are to become realities | it will be in my power now to make life one long love making |  dearest love there is a certain effect of light on your black hair which could rivet me for hours my eyes full of tears as i gazed at your sweet person were it not that you turn away and say 'for shame you make me quite shy '|  to morrow then our love is to be made known | oh pauline | the eyes of others the curiosity of strangers weigh on my soul | let us go to villenoix and stay there far from every one | i should like no creature in human form to intrude into the sanctuary where you are to be mine i could even wish that when we are dead it should cease to exist should be destroyed | yes i would fain hide from all nature a happiness which we alone can understand alone can feel which is so stupendous that i throw myself into it only to die it is a gulf |  do not be alarmed by the tears that have wetted this page they are tears of joy | my only blessing we need never part again | in 1823 i traveled from paris to touraine by diligence | at mer we took up a passenger for blois | as the guard put him into that part of the coach where i had my seat he said jestingly: you will not be crowded monsieur lefebvre |  i was in fact alone | on hearing this name and seeing a white haired old man who looked eighty at least i naturally thought of lambert's uncle | after a few ingenious questions i discovered that i was not mistaken | the good man had been looking after his vintage at mer and was returning to blois | i then asked for some news of my old chum | at the first word the old priest's face as grave and stern already as that of a soldier who has gone through many hardships became more sad and dark the lines on his forehead were slightly knit he set his lips and said with a suspicious glance: then you have never seen him since you left the college |  indeed i have not said i |  but we are equally to blame for our forgetfulness | young men as you know lead such an adventurous and storm tossed life when they leave their school forms that it is only by meeting that they can be sure of an enduring affection | however a reminiscence of youth sometimes comes as a reminder and it is impossible to forget entirely especially when two lads have been such friends as we were | we went by the name of the poet and pythagoras | i told him my name when he heard it the worthy man grew gloomier than ever |  then you have not heard his story | said he |  my poor nephew was to be married to the richest heiress in blois but the day before his wedding he went mad | lambert mad  cried i in dismay |  but from what cause | he had the finest memory the most strongly constituted brain the soundest judgment i ever met with | really a great genius with too great a passion for mysticism perhaps but the kindest heart in the world | something most extraordinary must have happened |  i see you knew him well said the priest | from mer till we reached blois we talked only of my poor friend with long digressions by which i learned the facts i have already related in the order of their interest | i confessed to his uncle the character of our studies and of his nephew's predominant ideas then the old man told me of the events that had come into lambert's life since our parting | from monsieur lefebvre's account lambert had betrayed some symptoms of madness before his marriage but they were such as are common to men who love passionately and seemed to me less startling when i knew how vehement his love had been and when i saw mademoiselle de villenoix | in the country where ideas are scarce a man overflowing with original thought and devoted to a system as louis was might well be regarded as eccentric to say the least | his language would no doubt seem the stranger because he so rarely spoke | he would say that man does not dwell in heaven where any one else would have said we are not made on the same pattern | every clever man has his own quirks of speech | the broader his genius the more conspicuous are the singularities which constitute the various degrees of eccentricity | in the country an eccentric man is at once set down as half mad |  yesterday we made a new law to prevent financial panics and yesterday maybe a school teacher in ohio taught his first letters to a boy who will one day write a song that will give cheer to the millions of our race | we are all making the flag |  but i said impatiently these people were only working | then came a great shout from the flag: the work that we do is the making of the flag |  i am not the flag not at all | i am nothing more than its shadow |  i am whatever you make me nothing more |  i am your belief in yourself your dream of what a people may become |  i live a changing life a life of moods and passions of heart breaks and tired muscles |  sometimes i am strong with pride when workmen do an honest piece of work fitting the rails together truly |  sometimes i droop for then purpose has gone from me and cynically i play the coward |  sometimes i am loud garish and full of that ego that blasts judgment |  but always i am all that you hope to be and have the courage to try for |  i am song and fear struggle and panic and ennobling hope |  i am the day's work of the weakest man and the largest dream of the most daring |  i am the constitution and the courts statutes and the statute makers soldier and dreadnaught drayman and street sweep cook counselor and clerk |  i am the battle of yesterday and the mistake of to morrow |  i am the mystery of the men who do without knowing why |  i am the clutch of an idea and the reasoned purpose of resolution |  i am no more than what you believe me to be and i am all that you believe i can be |  i am what you make me nothing more |  i swing before your eyes as a bright gleam of color a symbol of yourself the pictured suggestion of that big thing which makes this nation | my stars and my stripes are your dream and your labors | they are bright with cheer brilliant with courage firm with faith because you have made them so out of your hearts | for you are the makers of the flag and it is well that you glory in the making | our flag margaret sangster flag of the fearless hearted flag of the broken chain flag in a day dawn started never to pale or wane | dearly we prize its colors with the heaven light breaking through the clustered stars and the steadfast bars the red the white and the blue | flag of the sturdy fathers flag of the royal sons beneath its folds it gathers earth's best and noblest ones | boldly we wave its colors our veins are thrilled anew by the steadfast bars the clustered stars the red the white and the blue | our history and our flag 1 william backus guitteau love of country is a sentiment common to all peoples and ages but no land has ever been dearer to its people than our own america | no nation has a history more inspiring no country has institutions more deserving of patriotic love | turning the pages of our nation's history the young citizen sees columbus serene in the faith of his dream the mayflower bearing the lofty soul of the puritan washington girding on his holy sword lincoln striking the shackles from the helpless slave the constitution organizing the farthest west with north and south and east into one great republic the tremendous energy of free life trained in free schools utilizing our immense natural resources increasing the nation's wealth with the aid of advancing science multiplying fertile fields and noble workshops and busy schools and happy homes | we went crazy over catalepsy and with the eagerness that boys throw into every pursuit we endeavored to endure pain by thinking of something else | we exhausted ourselves by making experiments not unlike those of the epileptic fanatics of the last century a religious mania which will some day be of service to the science of humanity | i would stand on lambert's chest remaining there for several minutes without giving him the slightest pain but notwithstanding these crazy attempts we did not achieve an attack of catalepsy | this digression seemed necessary to account for my first doubts which were however completely dispelled by monsieur lefebvre |  when this attack had passed off said he my nephew sank into a state of extreme terror a dejection that nothing could overcome | he thought himself unfit for marriage | i watched him with the care of a mother for her child and found him preparing to perform on himself the operation to which origen believed he owed his talents | i at once carried him off to paris and placed him under the care of monsieur esquirol | all through our journey louis sat sunk in almost unbroken torpor and did not recognize me | the paris physicians pronounced him incurable and unanimously advised his being left in perfect solitude with nothing to break the silence that was needful for his very improbable recovery and that he should live always in a cool room with a subdued light mademoiselle de villenoix whom i had been careful not to apprise of louis' state he went on blinking his eyes but who was supposed to have broken off the match went to paris and heard what the doctors had pronounced | she immediately begged to see my nephew who hardly recognized her then like the noble soul she is she insisted on devoting herself to giving him such care as might tend to his recovery | she would have been obliged to do so if he had been her husband she said and could she do less for him as her lover |  she removed louis to villenoix where they have been living for two years | so instead of continuing my journey i stopped at blois to go to see louis | good monsieur lefebvre would not hear of my lodging anywhere but at his house where he showed me his nephew's room with the books and all else that had belonged to him | at every turn the old man could not suppress some mournful exclamation showing what hopes louis' precocious genius had raised and the terrible grief into which this irreparable ruin had plunged him |  that young fellow knew everything my dear sir | said he laying on the table a volume containing spinoza's works |  how could so well organized a brain go astray |  indeed monsieur said i was it not perhaps the result of its being so highly organized | if he really is a victim to the malady as yet unstudied in all its aspects which is known simply as madness i am inclined to attribute it to his passion | his studies and his mode of life had strung his powers and faculties to a degree of energy beyond which the least further strain was too much for nature love was enough to crack them or to raise them to a new form of expression which we are maligning perhaps by ticketing it without due knowledge | in fact he may perhaps have regarded the joys of marriage as an obstacle to the perfection of his inner man and his flight towards spiritual spheres |  my dear sir said the old man after listening to me with attention your reasoning is no doubt very sound but even if i could follow it would this melancholy logic comfort me for the loss of my nephew | lambert's uncle was one of those men who live only by their affections | i went to villenoix on the following day | the kind old man accompanied me to the gates of blois | when we were out on the road to villenoix he stopped me and said: as you may suppose i do not go there | but do not forget what i have said and in mademoiselle de villenoix's presence affect not to perceive that louis is mad | he remained standing on the spot where i left him watching me till i was out of sight | i made my way to the chateau of villenoix not without deep agitation | my thoughts were many at each step on this road which louis had so often trodden with a heart full of hopes a soul spurred on by the myriad darts of love | the shrubs the trees the turns of the winding road where little gullies broke the banks on each side were to me full of strange interest | i tried to enter into the impressions and thoughts of my unhappy friend | those evening meetings on the edge of the coombe where his lady love had been wont to find him had no doubt initiated mademoiselle de villenoix into the secrets of that vast and lofty spirit as i had learned them all some years before | but the thing that most occupied my mind and gave to my pilgrimage the interest of intense curiosity in addition to the almost pious feelings that led me onwards was that glorious faith of mademoiselle de villenoix's which the good priest had told me of | had she in the course of time been infected with her lover's madness or had she so completely entered into his soul that she could understand all its thoughts even the most perplexed | i lost myself in the wonderful problem of feeling passing the highest inspirations of passion and the most beautiful instances of self sacrifice | that one should die for the other is an almost vulgar form of devotion | to live faithful to one love is a form of heroism that immortalized mademoiselle dupuis | when the great napoleon and lord byron could find successors in the hearts of women they had loved we may well admire bolingbroke's widow but mademoiselle dupuis could feed on the memories of many years of happiness whereas mademoiselle de villenoix having known nothing of love but its first excitement seemed to me to typify love in its highest expression | if she were herself almost crazy it was splendid but if she had understood and entered into his madness she combined with the beauty of a noble heart a crowning effort of passion worthy to be studied and honored | when i saw the tall turrets of the chateau remembering how often poor lambert must have thrilled at the sight of them my heart beat anxiously | as i recalled the events of our boyhood i was almost a sharer in his present life and situation | at last i reached a wide deserted courtyard and i went into the hall of the house without meeting a soul | there the sound of my steps brought out an old woman to whom i gave a letter written to mademoiselle de villenoix by monsieur lefebvre | in a few minutes this woman returned to bid me enter and led me to a low room floored with black and white marble the venetian shutters were closed and at the end of the room i dimly saw louis lambert |  be seated monsieur said a gentle voice that went to my heart | mademoiselle de villenoix was at my side before i was aware of her presence and noiselessly brought me a chair which at first i would not accept | it was so dark that at first i saw mademoiselle de villenoix and lambert only as two black masses perceived against the gloomy background | i presently sat down under the influence of the feeling that comes over us almost in spite of ourselves under the obscure vault of a church | my eyes full of the bright sunshine accustomed themselves gradually to this artificial night |  monsieur is your old school friend she said to louis | he made no reply | at last i could see him and it was one of those spectacles that are stamped on the memory for ever | he was standing his elbows resting on the cornice of the low wainscot which threw his body forward so that it seemed bowed under the weight of his bent head | his hair was as long as a woman's falling over his shoulders and hanging about his face giving him a resemblance to the busts of the great men of the time of louis xiv | his face was perfectly white | he constantly rubbed one leg against the other with a mechanical action that nothing could have checked and the incessant friction of the bones made a doleful sound | near him was a bed of moss on boards |  he very rarely lies down said mademoiselle de villenoix but whenever he does he sleeps for several days | louis stood as i beheld him day and night with a fixed gaze never winking his eyelids as we do | having asked mademoiselle de villenoix whether a little more light would hurt our friend on her reply i opened the shutters a little way and could see the expression of lambert's countenance |alas  he was wrinkled white headed his eyes dull and lifeless as those of the blind | his features seemed all drawn upwards to the top of his head | i made several attempts to talk to him but he did not hear me | he was a wreck snatched from the grave a conquest of life from death or of death from life | i stayed for about an hour sunk in unaccountable dreams and lost in painful thought | i listened to mademoiselle de villenoix who told me every detail of this life that of a child in arms | suddenly louis ceased rubbing his legs together and said slowly: the angels are white | i cannot express the effect produced upon me by this utterance by the sound of the voice i had loved whose accents so painfully expected had seemed to be lost for ever | my eyes filled with tears in spite of every effort | an involuntary instinct warned me making me doubt whether louis had really lost his reason | i was indeed well assured that he neither saw nor heard me but the sweetness of his tone which seemed to reveal heavenly happiness gave his speech an amazing effect | these words the incomplete revelation of an unknown world rang in our souls like some glorious distant bells in the depth of a dark night | i was no longer surprised that mademoiselle de villenoix considered lambert to be perfectly sane | the life of the soul had perhaps subdued that of the body | his faithful companion had no doubt as i had at that moment intuitions of that melodious and beautiful existence to which we give the name of heaven in its highest meaning | this woman this angel always was with him seated at her embroidery frame and each time she drew the needle out she gazed at lambert with sad and tender feeling | unable to endure this terrible sight for i could not like mademoiselle de villenoix read all his secrets i went out and she came with me to walk for a few minutes and talk of herself and of lambert |  louis must no doubt appear to be mad said she |  but he is not if the term mad ought only to be used in speaking of those whose brain is for some unknown cause diseased and who can show no reason in their actions | everything in my husband is perfectly balanced | though he did not actively recognize you it is not that he did not see you | he has succeeded in detaching himself from his body and discerns us under some other aspect what that is i know not | when he speaks he utters wondrous things | only it often happens that he concludes in speech an idea that had its beginning in his mind or he may begin a sentence and finish it in thought | to other men he seems insane to me living as i do in his mind his ideas are quite lucid | i follow the road his spirit travels and though i do not know every turning i can reach the goal with him |  which of us has not often known what it is to think of some futile thing and be led on to some serious reflection through the ideas or memories it brings in its train | not unfrequently after speaking about some trifle the simple starting point of a rapid train of reflections a thinker may forget or be silent as to the abstract connection of ideas leading to his conclusion and speak again only to utter the last link in the chain of his meditations |  inferior minds to whom this swift mental vision is a thing unknown who are ignorant of the spirit's inner workings laugh at the dreamer and if he is subject to this kind of obliviousness regard him as a madman | louis is always in this state he soars perpetually through the spaces of thought traversing them with the swiftness of a swallow i can follow him in his flight | this is the whole history of his madness | the sixteenth century was far behind our own in many of its productions theatrical performances displays of fireworks and concert music | there were illuminations and mounted torchlight processions and rockets were frequently used but an illuminated garden f te such as the emperor of austria gave for the shah of persia at sch nbrunn would at that time have been impossible | the same might be said of certain forms of musical entertainment for example concerts | society in that age would have shuddered at the orchestral music of to day and the ear splitting drums would have appeared barbarous to the italians of the renaissance just as would the military parades which are still among the favorite spectacles with which distinguished guests are either honored or intimidated at the great courts of europe | even then tourneys were rare although there were occasional combats of gladiators whose costumes were greatly admired | the duke and his master of ceremonies had spent weeks in preparing the program for the wedding festivities although these did not admit of any great variety being limited as they are now to banquets balls and theatrical productions | it was from the last named form of entertainment that ercole promised himself the most and which he expected would win for him the applause of the cultivated world | he was one of the most active patrons of the theater during the renaissance | several years before he had commissioned the poets at his court to translate some of the plays of plautus and terence into terza rima and had produced them | guarino berardo collenuccio and even bojordo had been employed in this work by him | as early as 1486 an italian version of the men chmi the favorite play of plautus had been produced in ferrara | the animal's instincts are the product of the coercion of the environment in which it develops | hence its variety | iii in man the will becomes a power peculiar to him and exceeding in intensity that of any other species | iv by constant assimilation the will depends on the substance it meets with again and again in all its transmutations pervading them by thought which is a product peculiar to the human will in combination with the modifications of that substance | v the innumerable forms assumed by thought are the result of the greater or less perfection of the human mechanism | vi the will acts through organs commonly called the five senses which in fact are but one the faculty of sight | feeling and tasting hearing and smelling are sight modified to the transformations of the substance which man can absorb in two conditions: untransformed and transformed | vii everything of which the form comes within the cognizance of the one sense of sight may be reduced to certain simple bodies of which the elements exist in the air the light or in the elements of air and light | sound is a condition of the air colors are all conditions of light every smell is a combination of air and light hence the four aspects of matter with regard to man sound color smell and shape have the same origin for the day is not far off when the relationship of the phenomena of air and light will be made clear | thought which is allied to light is expressed in words which depend on sound | to man then everything is derived from the substance whose transformations vary only through number a certain quantitative dissimilarity the proportions resulting in the individuals or objects of what are classed as kingdoms | viii when the substance is absorbed in sufficient number or quantity it makes of man an immensely powerful mechanism in direct communication with the very element of the substance and acting on organic nature in the same way as a large stream when it absorbs the smaller brooks | volition sets this force in motion independently of the mind | by its concentration it acquires some of the qualities of the substance such as the swiftness of light the penetrating power of electricity and the faculty of saturating a body to which must be added that it apprehends what it can do | still there is in man a primordial and overruling phenomenon which defies analysis | man may be dissected completely the elements of will and mind may perhaps be found but there still will remain beyond apprehension the x against which i once used to struggle | that x is the word the logos whose communication burns and consumes those who are not prepared to receive it | makers of the flag franklin k lane a portion of an address delivered by the secretary of the interior to the employees of the department of the interior on flag day 1914 | this morning as i passed into the land office the flag dropped me a most cordial salutation and from its rippling folds i heard it say: good morning mr flag maker |  i beg your pardon old glory i said aren't you mistaken | i am not the president of the united states nor a member of congress nor even a general in the army | i am only a government clerk |  i greet you again mr flag maker replied the gay voice i know you well | you are the man who worked in the swelter of yesterday straightening out the tangle of that farmer's homestead in idaho or perhaps you found the mistake in that indian contract in oklahoma or helped to clear that patent for the hopeful inventor in new york or pushed the opening of that new ditch in colorado or made that mine in illinois more safe or brought relief to the old soldier in wyoming | no matter whichever one of these beneficient individuals you may happen to be i give you greeting mr flag maker | i was about to pass on when the flag stopped me with these words: yesterday the president spoke a word that made happier the future of ten million peons in mexico but that act looms no larger on the flag than the struggle which the boy in georgia is making to win the corn club prize this summer | if abstraction as compared with instinct is an almost divine power it is nevertheless incredibly weak as compared with the gift of specialism which is the formula of god | abstraction comprises all nature in a germ more virtually than a seed contains the whole system of a plant and its fruits | from abstraction are derived laws arts social ideas and interests | it is the glory and the scourge of the earth: its glory because it has created social life its scourge because it allows man to evade entering into specialism which is one of the paths to the infinite | man measures everything by abstractions: good and evil virtue and crime | its formula of equity is a pair of scales its justice is blind | god's justice sees: there is all the difference | there must be intermediate beings then dividing the sphere of instinct from the sphere of abstractions in whom the two elements mingle in an infinite variety of proportions | some have more of one some more of the other | and there are also some in which the two powers neutralize each other by equality of effect | xvi specialism consists in seeing the things of the material universe and the things of the spiritual universe in all their ramifications original and causative | the greatest human geniuses are those who started from the darkness of abstraction to attain to the light of specialism |  specialism species sight speculation or seeing everything and all at once speculum a mirror or means of apprehending a thing by seeing the whole of it | jesus had the gift of specialism he saw each fact in its root and in its results in the past where it had its rise and in the future where it would grow and spread his sight pierced into the understanding of others | the perfection of the inner eye gives rise to the gift of specialism | specialism brings with it intuition | intuition is one of the faculties of the inner man of which specialism is an attribute | intuition acts by an imperceptible sensation of which he who obeys it is not conscious: for instance napoleon instinctively moving from a spot struck immediately afterwards by a cannon ball | xvii between the sphere of abstraction and that of specialism as between those of abstraction and instinct there are beings in whom the attributes of both combine and produce a mixture these are men of genius | xviii specialism is necessarily the most perfect expression of man and he is the link binding the visible world to the higher worlds he acts sees and feels by his inner powers | the man of abstraction thinks | the man of instinct acts | xix hence man has three degrees | that of instinct below the average that of abstraction the general average that of specialism above the average | specialism opens to man his true career the infinite dawns on him he sees what his destiny must be | xx there are three worlds the natural the spiritual and the divine | humanity passes through the natural world which is not fixed either in its essence and unfixed in its faculties | the spiritual world is fixed in its essence and unfixed in its faculties | the divine world is necessarily a material worship a spiritual worship and a divine worship: three forms expressed in action speech and prayer or in other words in deed apprehension and love | instinct demands deed abstraction is concerned with ideas specialism sees the end it aspires to god with presentiment or contemplation | xxi hence perhaps some day the converse of et verbum caro factum est will become the epitome of a new gospel which will proclaim that the flesh shall be made the word and become the utterance of god | xxii the resurrection is the work of the wind of heaven sweeping over the worlds | the angel borne on the wind does not say: arise ye dead he says arise ye who live | such are the meditations which i have with great difficulty cast in a form adapted to our understanding | there are some others which pauline remembered more exactly wherefore i know not and which i wrote from her dictation but they drive the mind to despair when knowing in what an intellect they originated we strive to understand them | i will quote a few of them to complete my study of this figure partly too perhaps because in these last aphorisms lambert's formulas seem to include a larger universe than the former set which would apply only to zoological evolution | white is for purity red for valor blue for justice and altogether bunting stripes stars and colors blazing in the sky make the flag of our country to be cherished by all our hearts to be upheld by all our hands | index albany reached by the dutch 2 | ii motion is so to speak number in action | iii motion is the product of a force generated by the word and by resistance which is matter | but for resistance motion would have had no results its action would have been infinite | newton's gravitation is not a law but an effect of the general law of universal motion | iv motion acting in proportion to resistance produces a result which is life | as soon as one or the other is the stronger life ceases | v no portion of motion is wasted it always produces number still it can be neutralized by disproportionate resistance as in minerals | vi number which produces variety of all kinds also gives rise to harmony which in the highest meaning of the word is the relation of parts to the whole | vii but for motion everything would be one and the same | its products identical in their essence differ only by number which gives rise to faculties | viii man looks to faculties angels look to the essence | this is the history for which our flag stands and when the young citizen salutes the flag he should think of the great ideals which it represents | the flag stands for democracy for liberty under the law it stands for heroic courage and self reliance for equality of opportunity for self sacrifice and the cause of humanity it stands for free public education and for peace among all nations | when you salute the flag you should resolve that your own life will be dedicated to these ideals | xii the unit was the starting point of every product: compounds are derived from it but the end must be identical with the beginning | hence this spiritual formula: the compound unit the variable unit the fixed unit | xiii the universe is the unit in variety | motion is the means number is the result | the end is the return of all things to the unit which is god | xiv three and seven are the two chief spiritual numbers | xv three is the formula of created worlds | it is the spiritual sign of the creation as it is the material sign of dimension | in fact god has worked by curved lines only: the straight line is an attribute of the infinite and man who has the presentiment of the infinite reproduces it in his works | two is the number of generation | three is the number of life which includes generation and offspring | add the sum of four and you have seven the formula of heaven | above all is god he is the unit | after going in to see louis once more i took leave of his wife and went home lost in ideas so adverse to social life that in spite of a promise to return to villenoix i did not go | the sight of louis had had some mysteriously sinister influence over me | i was afraid to place myself again in that heavy atmosphere where ecstasy was contagious | any man would have felt as i did a longing to throw himself into the infinite just as one soldier after another killed himself in a certain sentry box where one had committed suicide in the camp at boulogne | it is a known fact that napoleon was obliged to have the hut burned which had harbored an idea that had become a mortal infection | vannozza of a truth had seen many of the former friends flatterers and parasites of her house desert it but a number among whom were several

cesarini passed away in 1510 | louis lambert died at the age of twenty eight september 25 1824 in his true love's arms | he was buried by her desire in an island in the park at villenoix | his tombstone is a plain stone cross without name or date | like a flower that has blossomed on the margin of a precipice and drops into it its colors and fragrance all unknown it was fitting that he too should fall | like many another misprized soul he had often yearned to dive haughtily into the void and abandon there the secrets of his own life | mademoiselle de villenoix would however have been quite justified in recording his name on that cross with her own | since her partner's death reunion has been her constant hourly hope | but the vanities of woe are foreign to faithful souls |
