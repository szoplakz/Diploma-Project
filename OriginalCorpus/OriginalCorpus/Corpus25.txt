shall soon be making love to another girl | chapter i a crescent of a girl when madge alden was seventeen years of age an event occurred which promised to be the misfortune of her life | at first she was almost overwhelmed and knew not what to do | she was but a young and inexperienced girl and for a year or more had been regarded as an invalid | madge alden was an orphan | four years prior to the opening of our story she had lost her mother her surviving parent and since had resided with her elder sister mary who was several years her senior and had married henry muir a merchant of new york city | this gentleman had cordially united with his wife in offering madge a home and his manner toward the young girl as far as his absorbed and busy life permitted had been almost paternal | he was a quiet reticent man who had apparently concentrated every faculty of soul and body on the problem of commercial success | trained to business from boyhood he had allowed it to become his life and he took it very seriously | it was to him an absorbing game his vocation and not a means to some ulterior end | he had already accumulated enough to maintain his family in affluence but he no more thought of retiring from trade than would a veteran whist player wish to throw up a handful of winning cards | the events of the world the fluctuations in prices over which he had no control brought to his endeavor the elements of chance and it was his mission to pit against these uncertainties untiring industry and such skill and foresight as he possessed | his domestic life was favorable to his ruling passion | mary alden at the time of her marriage was a quiet girl whose early life had been shadowed by sorrow | she had seen her father pass away in his prime and her mother become in consequence a sad and failing woman | the young girl rallied from these early years of depression into cheerfulness and thoroughly enjoyed what some might regard as a monotonous life but she never developed any taste for the diversions of society | thus it may be surmised that mr muir encountered no distractions after business hours | he ever found a good dinner awaiting him and his wife held herself in readiness to do what he wished during the evening so far as the claims of the children permitted | therefore there were few more contented men in the city than he and the name of henry muir had become a synonym among his acquaintances for methodical business habits | in character and antecedents his younger brother graydon muir who was also an inmate of his family presented many marked contrasts to the elder man | he had received a liberal education and had graduated at a city college | he had developed into one of the best products of metropolitan life and his defects were chiefly due to the circumstances of his lot | during his academic course he had been known as an athletic rather than a bookish man and had left his alma mater with an apollo like physique | at the same time he had developed fine literary tastes and was well informed even if he had not gone very deeply into the classics and the sciences that were remote from the business career which he had chosen | after a brief interval of foreign travel he had entered his brother's office and was schooling his buoyant pleasure loving temperament to the routine of trade | when business hours were over however graydon gave himself up to the gratification of his social tastes | his vitality and flow of spirits were so immense that wherever he went he always caused a breezy ripple of excitement | even veteran society girls found something exhilarating in the mirthful flash of his blue eyes and to be whirled through a waltz on his strong arm was a pleasure not declined by reigning belles | many looks that to other men might have been the arrows of cupid were directed toward him but they glanced harmlessly from his polished armor | society was to him what business was to his brother an arena in which he easily manifested his power | at the same time he was a manly fellow and had no taste for corner flirtations or the excitement of drawing perilously near to a committal with those who would have responded to marked attentions | the atmosphere he loved was that of general and social gayety | the girls that he singled out for his especial regard were noted for their vivacity and intelligence as well as their beauty | meanwhile he had won a reputation for his good natured attentions to wall flowers | such kindly efforts were rarely made at the promptings of conscience | the truth was he enjoyed life so fully himself that he disliked to see any one having a dismal time | it gave him genuine pleasure to come to a plain featured neglected damsel and set all her blood tingling by a brief whirl in a dance or a breezy chat that did her good body and soul so devoid of satire or patronage was the attention | his superb health and tireless strength his perfect familiarity with the usages of society and his graceful decision of action made everything he did appear as easy and natural as the beat of a bird's wing upon the air and in his large circle it was felt that no entertainment was complete without his presence | graydon was still attending college when madge alden first became associated with him in her home life | she was then but thirteen and was small and slight for her age | the first evening when she came down to dinner shrinking in the shadow of her sister lingered ever in her memory | even now it gave her pain to recall her embarrassment when she was compelled to take her seat in the full blaze of the light and meet the eyes of the one to whom she felt that she must appear so very plain and unattractive | clad in the deepest mourning pallid from grief and watching at her mother's bedside coming from a life of seclusion and sorrow sensitive in the extreme she had barely reached that age when awkwardness is in the ascendant and the quiet city home seemed the centre of a new and strange world | one other thing she remembered in that initial chapter of her life the kindly glances that graydon muir bent on the pale crescent of a girl who sat opposite to him | even as a child she knew that the handsome young fellow was not secretly laughing at or criticising her and before dinner was over she had ventured upon a shy grateful glance in reward for his good humored efforts to break the ice | there had in truth been no ice to break | the child was merely like a plant that had grown in the shade and to her the strong healthful youth was sunshine | his smile warmed and vivified her chilled nature his hearty words and manner were bracing to her over sensitive and timid soul and his unaffected unforced kindness was so constant that she gradually came to regard it as one of the best certainties of her life | she soon learned however that behind his sunny good nature was a fiery and impatient spirit ready to manifest itself if he was chafed beyond a certain point and so a slight element of fear was mingled with her childlike affection | he had sufficient tact to understand madge's diffidence and he knew that their family life would soon banish it | he welcomed this pale slip of a girl to their home circle because it gave him pleasure to pet and rally such a wraith into something like genuine existence | he also hoped that eventually she would become a source of amusement to him | nor was he disappointed | madge's mind was not colorless if her face was and she gradually began to respond to his mirthfulness and to take an interest intelligent for a child in what occupied his thoughts | kindness creates an atmosphere in which the most sensitive and diffident natures develop and reveal themselves and madge alden who might easily have been chilled into a reticent and dispirited girl eventually manifested an unusual versatility of fancy and thought acquiring also no slight power of expression | thus graydon obtained his reward | his brother was a grave and silent man to whom few themes could be broached except those of business and the events and politics of the day in their relation to trade | his sister in law was absorbed in household and family cares but madge's great black eyes responded with quick appreciation to all that he said and their merry nonsense often provoked a smile upon even the face of mr muir | the good natured sympathy of the young man therefore passed gradually into a genuine fraternal regard and he rarely came home of an evening without bringing flowers bonbons or some other evidence that he had remembered her | unconsciously to herself he became more to her than her sister who was indulgent in the extreme but not very demonstrative | her shyness disappeared and his caresses seemed as natural as those of an elder brother in which light she regarded him | thus time passed on and the girl rapidly approached the stature of womanhood | apparently she grew too fast for her slight reserve of physical strength | she nominally attended a fashionable school but was often absent from ill health and for this reason her sister permitted her to follow her own moods | indolence and inanition accounted largely for her lack of strength | exercise brought weariness and she would not take it | nothing pleased her more than to curl up on a lounge with a book and her sister seeing that she was reading most of the time felt that she was getting an education | to the busy lady a book was a book a kind of general fertilizer of the mind and as madge usually took cold when she went out and was assuredly acquiring from the multitude of volumes she devoured all the knowledge a woman needed she was safer in the evenly heated city house | the sisters had independent fortunes of their own and the great point in mrs muir's mind was that they should live and enjoy them | if madge was only sufficiently coddled now while she was growing she would get strong eventually and so the good lady who had as much knowledge of hygiene as of sanscrit tempted the invalid with delicacies permitted her to eat the confectionery that graydon brought so often and generally indulged a nature that needed wise and firm development | thus madge lived on growing more pale and languid with each succeeding year | the absence in the mountains and at the seashore which mr muir permitted to his family every summer brought changes for the better even though the young girl spent most of the time in a hammock or reclining in the stern of a sail boat | she could not escape the invigoration caused by the mere breathing of pure air but during the winters in town she lost all and more than she had gained and sunk back into her old apathetic life | this life however contained two elements which gave some color and zest to her existence | all through the day she would look forward to graydon's return from business and when she heard his latch key the faintest possible color would steal into her cheeks | up stairs two steps at a time he would come kiss her waltz her about the room with a strength which scarcely permitted her feet to touch the floor then toss her back on the lounge where she would lie laughing breathless and happy | with a man's ignorant tolerance he accepted her character as an invalid and felt that the least he could do was to brighten a life which seemed so dismal to him | when he came down dressed for dinner or some evening engagement she looked at him with a frank admiring pride that amused him immensely | when he returned earlier than usual he often found her still upon the lounge with her inevitable book usually a novel and then he would take her upon his lap and call her his dear little spook the household ghost that would soon cease to cast a shadow and she with a languid curiosity would easily beguile from him a portrayal of the scenes through which he had just passed | she cared little for them but from his stores of vitality and strength he imparted life to her and without understanding why she simply knew she was happy | apart from her fondness for the unreal scenes presented by the miscellaneous books she read scenes all the more unreal because she had no experience by which to correct them she had one other taste which promised well for the future a sincere love of music | she was taking lessons but it was from a superficial teacher who was content to give her pretty and showy pieces and she brought even to this favorite study the desultory habits which characterized all her efforts to obtain an education | when she sat down to her piano however nature was her strong ally | her ear was fine and correct and her sensitive fanciful spirit gave delicacy and originality to her touch | it scarcely seems possible for one to become a sympathetic musician without a large degree of imagination and a nature easily moved by thought and feeling | the young girl's thoughts and feelings were as yet very vague not concentrated on definite objects and yet so good a connoisseur as graydon often acknowledged her power and would listen with pleased attention to her girlish rendering of music made familiar to him by the great performers of the day | he enjoyed it all the more because it was her own interpretation often incorrect but never commonplace or slovenly and when her fingers wandered among the keys in obedience to her own impulses he was even more charmed although the melody was usually without much meaning | she was also endowed with the rudiments of a fine voice and would often strike notes of surpassing sweetness and power but her tones would soon quaver and break and she complained that it tired her to sing | that ended the matter for anything that wearied her was not to be thought of | thus she had drifted on with time unconscious of herself unconscious of the influences that would bring to pass the decisive events in the future | she was like multitudes of others who are controlled by circumstances of their lot until the time comes when a deep personal experience applies the touchstone to character | chapter ii graydon muir madge alden was almost seventeen and yet she was in many respects a child | scenes portrayed in books had passed before her mind like pictures having no definite significance | mr muir was to her like some of the forces in nature quiet unobtrusive omnipotent and she accepted him without thought | her sister was one whom she could love easily as a matter of course | she was an indulgent household providence who cared for the young girl as she did for her own little children | if anything was amiss in madge's wardrobe the elder sister made it right at once if madge had a real or imaginary ailment mary was always ready to prescribe a soothing remedy and if there was a cloud in the sky or the wind blew chill she said madge do be prudent you know how easily you take cold | thus was provided the hot house atmosphere in which the tender exotic existed | it could not be said that she had thrived or bloomed | graydon muir was the one positive element with which she had come in contact and thus far she had always accepted him in the spirit of a child | he had begun petting her and treating her like a sister when she was a child | his manner toward her had grown into a habit which had its source in his kindly disposition | to him she was but a weak sickly little girl with a dismal present and a more dreary outlook | sometimes he mentally compared her with the brilliant girls he met in society and especially with one but a little older than madge who appeared a natural queen in the drawing room | his life abounded in activity interests and pleasures and if it was his impulse to throw a little zest into the experiences of those in society who had no claims upon him he was still more disposed to cheer and amuse the invalid in his own home | moreover he had become sincerely fond of her | madge was neither querulous nor stupid | although not conceited he had the natural vanity of a handsome and successful man and while the evident fact that he was such a hero in her eyes amused him it also predisposed him to kindly and sympathetic feeling toward her | he saw that she gave him not only a sisterly allegiance but also a richer and fuller tribute and that in her meagre and shadowed life he was the brightest element | she tried to do more for him than for any one else while she made him feel that as an invalid she could not do very much and that he should not expect it | she would often play for him an hour at a time and again she would be so languid that no coaxing could lure her from the sofa | occasionally she would even read aloud a few pages with her musical and sympathetic voice but would soon throw down the book with an air of exhaustion and plead that he would read to her | in her weakness there was nothing repulsive and without calculation she made many artless appeals to his strength | he generously responded saying to himself poor little thing | she has a hard time of it | with her great black eyes she might be a beauty if she only had health and was like other girls but as it is she is so light and pale and limp that i sometimes feel as if i were petting a wraith | of late she had begun to go out with him a little he choosing small and quiet companies among people well known to the muirs and occasionally her sister also went | her r le of invalid was carefully maintained and recognized | graydon had always prided himself on his loyalty as an escort and as long as he was devoted the neglect of other young men was welcomed rather than regretted for except toward him all her old shyness still existed | with the consciousness that he was caring for her she was well content with some half secluded nook of observation from which she looked out upon scenes that were like an animated story | she wove fanciful imaginings around those who attracted her attention and on her return laughingly discussed the people who had passed like players before her eyes | graydon encouraged her to do this for her ignorance of society made her remarks original and amusing | he knew the conventional status of every one they met as accurately as his brother recognized the commercial value of the securities that passed under his eye and madge's estimates often seemed absurd to the last degree | whenever she went out with graydon his course was eminently satisfactory she never felt herself neglected while at the same time she saw that his attentions were welcomed everywhere | she never lost her serene sense of proprietorship and only grew more fond of him as she noted how readily he left the side of beautiful and gifted women to look after her | he had often laughingly asserted that he went into society only for amusement and his course under her own observation confirmed his words | early in the winter during which our story opens she had caught a succession of colds and one proved so severe and obstinate that her friends were alarmed fearing that she was going into a decline | she slowly rallied however but was more frail than ever | before the gay season closed just preceding lent madge received an invitation to a very large party | graydon urged her to go remarking that she had not yet seen society |  don't be afraid i'll take care of you little ghost he said and with this assurance she accompanied him contrary to her sister's advice | it was indeed a brilliant occasion | the wide rooms of a madison avenue palace were thronged and she had never even imagined such toilets as caught her eye on every side | there were so many present that she could easily maintain her position of quiet spectator and her eyes dilated with pleasure as she saw that graydon was as much a leader as at other places where comparatively few were present | at last her attention was attracted by one who was evidently a late comer and whose presence appeared to fill the apartment | all the others paled before her as do the stars when the moon rises among them | she was evidently young and yet she did not suggest youth | one would almost imagine that she had never had a childhood or a girlhood but was rather a direct creation of metropolitan society | her exquisitely turned shoulders and arms were bare and the diamonds about her neck were a circlet of fire | the complexion of her fair oval face was singularly pure and the color came and went so easily as to prove that it owed nothing to art | the expression of her gray eyes was rather cold and haughty when at rest and gave an impression of pride and the consciousness of power | the trait which to the observant madge seemed most marked at first however was her perfect ease | her slightest movement was grace itself | her entire self possession was indicated by the manner in which she greeted the men who sought her attention and many there were | she could be perfectly polite yet as repellent as ice or she could smile with a fascination that even madge felt would be hard to resist | this girl who was such an immense contrast to herself wholly fixed her attention as she stood for a few moments like a queen surrounded by her courtiers | graydon had gone for a glass of water and meeting a friend had been detained for a brief space | madge saw him coming saw his eye light up with admiration as he caught sight of the beautiful stranger but he came directly to her and asked genially if there was anything else she would like | yes  who is that girl yonder |  miss wildmere | isn't she lovely | she promised me last week her first dance for this evening | will you excuse me for a little while |  certainly and yet she was conscious of a sudden and odd little protest at heart | he approached the beauty | miss wildmere's face flushed with pleasure and softened into a welcoming smile such as she had not yet bestowed upon any who had sought her favor | then in swift alternation she bent upon madge a brief cold glance of scrutiny | so brief was it and so complacent was the expression of the belle as she turned away that the pallid sensitive girl was told as by words you are nothing | that glance was like a sharp deep wound and pierced where she was most vulnerable | it said to her you are not capable of being anything to graydon muir | i am not in the least afraid of you | what was she to him | what did she wish to be | to these questions madge had but one answer | any and every girl in her belief would be only too glad to win him | he had said that miss wildmere was lovely his eyes had expressed an admiration which he had never bestowed upon her he had led the beauty away with a glad content in his face and the crowded room was made empty by their absence | she was no longer conscious of weakness but obeying her impulse sprang up and followed them to the ballroom | concealed by a little group she stood unwearied and watched them as they glided hither and thither with a grace that attracted many eyes | the music appeared to control and animate them and their motion was harmony itself | graydon evidently thought only of his fair partner but her swift glances were everywhere gathering the rich revenue of admiration which was freely offered | for a second she encountered madge's large black eyes full of trouble and a satirical smile proved that she enjoyed the poor girl's solicitude | to deepen it she looked up at graydon and said something that caused his face to flush with pleasure | his response was more decisive for the swift color came into her face and her eyes drooped | the by play was momentary and would not have been seen by a less vigilant observer than madge but to her it gave the undoubted impression that they were lovers | when miss wildmere looked again to see the result of her unkindly strategy madge was gone | in reaction she had grown almost faint and reached her former retreat with difficulty | but all her latent womanhood speedily rallied to meet this strange and but half comprehended emergency | the impulse now uppermost was to retain her self control and reach the seclusion of her own room | how she was to endure the long hours she scarcely knew | she did not dare to think | indeed the effort was scarcely possible for her mind was at first in tumult with only one thing clear a poignant sense of loss and trouble | graydon was a long time away longer than he had ever been before when acting as her escort | while she felt this neglect and interpreted it naturally she was not sorry | she dreaded meeting him again | in one brief hour her old ease and freedom with him had gone | she wondered at the change in herself yet knew that it was as definite and decided as if she had become another person | when be had brought her the glass of water she could look into his face with the frank directness of a child | why could she not do so now | why did she almost tremble at the thought of his glance his touch his presence | she knew that he would come back with his old genial kindly manner that he would be the same | but a change had occurred in her which made the fabled transmutations of magic wands seem superficial indeed | would he note this change | could he guess the cause | oh what was the cause | even her pale face grew crimson for there are truths that come to the consciousness like the lightning from heaven | she did not need to think to weigh and reason | a woman's heart is often above and beyond her reason and hers had been awakened at last by the all powerful touch of love | the time passed and still graydon did not come | he was not absent very long and yet it began to seem terribly long to her | she had overrated her powers and found that even pride could not sustain her | she had no reserve of strength to draw upon | the heat of the room grew oppressive and she was unaccustomed to throngs confusion and noise | the consciousness of her weakness was forced upon her most painfully at last by the appearance of miss wildmere on graydon's arm | the belle was smiling radiant her step elastic her eyes shining with excitement and pleasure | her practiced scrutiny had assured her that she was the queen of the hour the handsomest and most courtly man present was so devoted as to suggest that he might easily become a lover she had seen many glances of envy and one in the case of poor madge of positive pain | what more could her heart desire | graydon conducted her to her chaperon near whom half a dozen gentlemen were waiting for a chance to be his successor and having obtained her promise for another dance later in the evening he turned deprecatingly to madge | his apologies ceased before they were half spoken | she looked so white and ill that he was alarmed and asked permission to get her a glass of wine |  no graydon she said then hesitated for she felt the color coming into her face while a strange blur confused every object in the room |  i'm very very sorry she added hastily after a moment |  i ought not to have come | i'm not equal to this | it wouldn't take you very long to drive home with me and then you could return | please graydon | her tone was so urgent and she appeared so weak that he complied at once saying with much compunction i should not have left you alone so long but supposed you were amusing yourself by looking at the people | she did not trust herself to reply | her one thought was to reach the refuge of her own apartment and to this end she concentrated her failing energies | the climb to the ladies' dressing room was a desperate effort but when she was once outside the house the cold pure air revived her slightly |  you can excuse me to our hostess she will not care she faltered and it seemed to her then that nobody would care | miss wildmere's glance had conveyed the estimate of society | if she could believe herself first in graydon's thoughts she would not be cast down but now the truth was overwhelming | she leaned away from him in the corner of the carriage but he put his strong arm round her and drew her to his breast | she tried to resist but was powerless | then came the torturing thought if i repel him if i act differently he will guess the reason and she was passive but he felt her slight form tremble |  my poor little ghost you are ill in very truth | i'm indeed sorry that i left you so long |  believe me graydon i am ill | please let that excuse me and explain | oh that i i were strong like miss wildmere |  isn't she a beauty | exclaimed the unconscious graydon |  the man who wins her might well be proud for he would have competitors by the score |  your chances seem excellent said madge in a low tone | he laughed complacently but added: you don't know these society belles | they can show a great deal of favor to more than one fellow yet never permit themselves to be pinned by a definite promise | they are harder to catch and hold than a wild bedouin but such a girl as miss wildmere is worth the effort | yes madge i do wish you were like her | it would be grand sport to champion you in society and see you run amuck among the fellows | it's a thousand pities that you are such an invalid | i've thought more than once that you were designed to be a beauty | with your eyes and stella wildmere's health you would be quite as effective after your style as she is in hers | never mind little sister i shall stand by you and as long as i live you shall always have a luxurious sofa with all the novels of the northern hemisphere at your command | who knows | you may grow strong one of these days | when you do i'll pick out the nice fellows for you | at every kindly word her heart grew heavier and when the carriage stopped at their door she could hardly mount the steps | in the hall she faltered and caught the hat rack for support | he lifted her in his arms and bore her easily to her room her sister following in much solicitude |  it's nothing said madge the company was too large and exciting for me | there was no need of graydon's carrying me upstairs but he would do it |  you poor dear | began her sister broodingly |  i feared it would be so | graydon is made of iron and will never realize how delicate you are |  he's very kind and more considerate than i deserve | as he says she added bitterly i'm nothing but a ghost and had better vanish |  nonsense madge said the young man with brusque kindness |  you know i want you to haunt me always | good by now little sister | i shall be de trop if i stay any longer | you'll be better in the morning and to morrow evening i'll remain home and entertain you | chapter iii the parting at last madge was alone | her sister had suggested everything she could think of meanwhile bewailing the young girl's extreme imprudence | madge entreated for quiet and rest and at last was left alone | hour after hour she lay with wide fixed gaze | her mind and imagination did not partake of her physical weakness and now they were abnormally active | as the bewilderment from the shock of her abrupt awakening passed the truth hourly grew clearer | from the time she had first come under her sister's roof graydon muir had begun to make himself essential to her | his uniform kindness had created trust freedom and a content akin to happiness | now all was swept away | she understood that his love was an affection resulting from pity and the strong genial forces of his nature | the girl who could kindle his spirit and inspire the best and most enthusiastic efforts of his manhood must be like miss wildmere strong beautiful capable of keeping step with him under society's critical eyes and not a mere shadow of a woman like herself | her morbidly acute fancy recalled the ballroom | she saw him again after his return encircling the fair girl with his arm and looking down into her eyes with a meaning unmistakable | oh why had she gone to that fatal party | the past in contrast to the present and the promise of the future seemed happiness itself | what could she do | what should she do | the more she thought of it the more unendurable her position appeared | in her vivid self consciousness the old relations could not continue | heretofore his caresses had been a matter of course of habit | they could be so no longer | she shrank from them with inexpressible fear knowing they would bring what little blood she possessed to her face and very brow in tell tale floods | the one event from which her sensitive womanhood drew back in deepest dread was his knowledge of her love | to prevent this she would rather die and she felt so weak and despairing that she thought and almost hoped she would die | if she could only go away where she would not see him and hide her wound | but how could she chained near his daily presence by weakness and helplessness | thus through the long night her despairing thoughts went to and fro and found no rest | miss wildmere's cold glance met her everywhere with the assurance that such a creature as she could never be anything to him and alas | his own words confirmed the verdict | love that gives all demands all and such pitiful affection as he now gave was only a mockery | the morning found her too weak to leave her room and for the few following days she made illness her excuse for remaining in seclusion | as graydon looked ruefully at her vacant chair the fourth evening after the company mrs muir remarked reproachfully i hope you now realize how delicate madge is | you never should have coaxed her to go to that party | he was filled with compunction and brought her flowers boxes of candy books and everything which he imagined would amuse her | at the same time he was growing a little impatient and provoked | he knew that he had taken her from the kindest motives | now that she gave up utterly to her invalidism he was inclined to question its necessity | he found that he missed her more than he would have imagined and his brief hours at home were dreary by reason of her seclusion |  why don't you call in a first class physician and put madge under a thorough course of treatment | he asked irritably |  she has no disease now that i know anything about and i don't believe it's necessary that she should remain so weak and lackadaisical |  we did have our doctor call often and he said she would outgrow her troubles if she would take plenty of fresh of fresh air and exercise | and now she positively refuses to see a physician |  i wouldn't humor a sick girl's fancies | she needs tonics and a general building up | with your permission i'll stop on my way downtown to morrow and tell dr anderson to call | mrs muir repeated the conversation to her sister with the literalness of which only unimaginative women are capable | madge turned her face to the wall and said coldly and decisively i refuse to see a physician | i am no longer a child and my wishes must be respected | after a moment she added apologetically: a doctor could do me no good | i shall soon be stronger | you understand me better than dr anderson can | you are the best and kindest nurse that ever breathed and i've had enough of doctors | i'll take anything you give me | these politic words appealed to mrs muir's weak point | nothing pleased her better than to believe that she could act the part of physician in the family and prescribing for madge was a source of unflagging interest | when she informed graydon of their decision in the morning he muttered something not very complimentary to either of the ladies but his good nature prevailed and instead of the doctor he ordered a superb bouquet of jacqueminot roses | meanwhile events were taking place of which madge had no knowledge but which would favor the plan slowly maturing in her mind | mr muir's business affairs had been taking a turn which made it probable that he would soon have to send his brother abroad | as long as there was uncertainty the reticent man said nothing but at last he received advices which brought him to a prompt decision and graydon was told that he must go at once | the young fellow submitted with fairly good grace | a brief foreign residence had its attractions but it interfered with his incipient suit to miss wildmere | he felt that he had not gone far enough for a definite proposal but he showed during the brief call that his time permitted an interest which the young lady well understood | since he was to be absent for an indefinite period and would have no chance to observe her other little affairs she permitted herself to be gracious and regretful up to the point of inspiring much hope for the future | with a nicety of tact the result of experience she confirmed his view that they had made favorable impressions on each other and that for the present they must be content with this | he had but a day in which to make his preparations in order to catch a fast steamer that sailed at daylight the following morning | madge's first sensation when she learned of his near departure was one of immense relief | the possibility which she had so dreaded could not now be realized and her plan could be carried out with far less embarrassment | but as time passed and she knew that their separation was so near her heart relented toward him with inexpressible tenderness | the roses that perfumed the room were a type of his unstinted kindness and consideration | she was just enough to acknowledge that these were even more than she could naturally expect from him that the majority of young men would have treated her with a half contemptuous pity which she was now beginning to admit would be partially deserved | on the occasions when she had gone out with him she had learned how unattractive in society her pale face and shy ways were | such attentions as she had received had been to her sensitive spirit like charity | graydon had been animated by unaffected good will and an affection that was after its kind genuine | while she felt that it would be no longer possible to receive these mild manifestations of regard while giving something so different she still knew with a half despairing sinking of heart how blank and desolate her life would be without them | she must meet him once more and word was sent that she would receive his good by after dinner | having safely passed this one interview she hoped that she might be able to control the future and either cease to be or bring about changes upon which she had resolved | only a soft dim light shone in her room when he came to say farewell |  why madge he exclaimed you are better | you actually have color | perhaps it is fever though he added dubiously |  at any rate it's very becoming |  i think it must be the reflection from your roses there you extravagant fellow she replied laughing |  that's famous madge | if you will laugh again like that i'll send you a present from paris | dear madge do get well | don't let us have anything dismal in our parting | it's only for a little while you know | when i come back it will be summer and i'll take you to the seashore or mountains or somewhere and help you get well |  you are very kind graydon | you have been a true brother to me from the time you tried to cheer and encourage the pale frightened little girl that sat opposite you at the dinner table | don't you remember |  of course i do | it seemed so droll to me that you were afraid when there was nothing to be afraid of |  my fear was natural | little as i know of the world i know that at least for one like me | it may seem weak and silly to you but brought up as i had been i was morbidly sensitive | you might have meant to be kind and sympathetic and all that and yet have hurt me cruelly | i have been out with you enough to know how i am regarded | i don't complain | i suppose it is the way of the world but it has not been your way | you have brought sunshine from the first not from a sense of duty not out of sheer humiliating pity but because it was the impulse of your strength to help and cheer one who was so weak and if if anything well i want you to know before you go away that i appreciate it all and shall never forget it |  oh come madge don't talk so dismally | what do you mean by 'if if anything' | you are going to get strong and well and we will open the campaign together next fall | she shook her head but asked lightly how will miss wildmere endure your absence |  easier than you i imagine | she knows how to console herself | still as my little sister i will tell you in confidence that she was very kind in our parting interview | how much her kindness meant only she herself knows and i've been in society long enough to know that it may mean very little |  are you so wholly bent upon winning her graydon |  oh you little mother eve | you are surely going to get well | there is no sign of longevity in a woman so certain as curiosity | i've not yet reached the point of breaking my heart about her whatever she does | wouldn't you like so beautiful a creature for your sister |  the contrast would be too great | i should indeed seem a ghost beside her | still if she would make you happy but she could go no further |  well well that's a very uncertain problem of the future | don't say anything about it at home | my brother don't like her father | they do not get on well in business | let us talk about yourself | what are you going to do while i am gone |  what can such a shadow as i do | tell me rather what you are going to do and where you'll be | you are real and what you do amounts to something |  there's one thing i'm going to do and that is write you some jolly letters that will make you laugh in spite of yourself | they will be part of the tonic treatment that i want you to promise me to begin at once |  i have already entered upon it graydon she said quietly and i don't think any one will value your letters more than i only i may not get strong enough to write very much in reply | i've never had occasion to write many letters you know | tell me where you will be and what you are going to do and she leaned back upon her lounge and closed her eyes | while he complied he thought she has grown pale and thin even to ghastliness yet i was sure she had color when i first came in | poor little thing | perhaps her fears are well founded and i may never see her again and the good hearted fellow was full of tender and remorseful regret | he was quite as fond of her as if she had been his own sister perhaps even more so for his affection was not merely the result of a natural tie but of something congenial to his nature in the girl herself and it cut him to the heart to see her so white and frail | he stopped a moment and she opened her eyes and looked at him inquiringly |  oh madge he broke out i'm so sorry i took you to that confounded party | you seemed getting on hopefully until that blasted evening | you must get well enough to haunt me after your old fashion | you don't know what a dear little sister you have become and i didn't know it myself until you were secluded by illness and all through my fault | you have barricaded yourself long enough with that stand and its vase of roses | i'm not going to say good by at this distance | he removed the stand and seating himself by her side he drew her head down upon his shoulder and kissed her again and again |  there now he continued you look perfectly lovely | kisses are a part of the tonic treatment you need and i wish i were going to be here to give them | why you queer little woman | i did not know you had so much blood in your body |  it's it's because i'm not strong she said struggling for release | suddenly she became still her face took on almost the hue of death and he saw that she was unconscious | in terrible alarm he laid her hastily on the lounge and rushed for mrs muir |  she has merely fainted said that experienced woman after a moment's examination |  you never will learn graydon that madge is not as strong as yourself | call one of the maids and leave her to me | that was the last time he saw madge alden for more than two years | she soon rallied but agreed with her sister that it would be best not to see him again | she sent him one of his own roses with the simple message good by | late at night he went down to the steamer depressed and anxious carrying with him the vivid memory of madge lying white and death like where he had laid her apparently lifeless form |  i shall never see her again he muttered |  such weakness must be mortal | chapter iv effort the deep experience the touchstone of character of latent power if such existed had come to madge alden | for days she had drifted helplessly on the rising tide of an apparently hopeless love | with every hour she comprehended more fully what graydon muir had become to her and all that he might have been | it seemed that she had been carried forward by a strong quiet current only to be wrecked at last | a sense of utter helplessness overwhelmed her | she could not ignore her love it had become interwoven with every interest and fibre of her life | at first she contemplated it in wonder in deeply troubled and alarmed perplexity | it was a momentous truth that had suddenly been made known as some irretrievable misfortune might have been revealed | she had read of love as children hear of mental anxieties and conflicts of which they have no comprehension | as she grew older it had been like poetry music romance something that kindled her imagination into vague pleasant dreams | it had been as remote from the present and her own experience as lives of adventure in strange and foreign lands | she had awakened at last to find that it was like her vital breath | by some law of her nature she had given not merely her thoughts and affection but her very self to another | to her dismay it made no difference that he had not sought the gift and was not even aware of it | circumstances over which she had no control had brought her into close companionship with graydon muir | she had seen him almost daily for years she knew him with the intimacy of a sister yet without the safeguard of a natural tie and from his genial kindness she had drawn almost all the life she had ever possessed | with an unconsciousness akin to that of a plant which takes root and thrives upon finding a soil adapted to it her love had been developed by his strong sunny nature | she soon recognized that it was a love such as she had never known unlike that for her mother or sister or any one else and it seemed to her that it could pass away only with herself | it was not a vague sentiment an indefinite longing it was the concentrated and imperious demand of her whole being which denied left little indeed even were the whole world hers | yet such were the cruel conditions of her lot that she could not speak of it even to one whose head had been pillowed on the same mother's breast and the thought that it might be discovered by its object made her turn cold with dread | it was a holy thing the spontaneous product of an unperverted heart and yet she must hide it as if it were a crime | so long as the state is christian and the jew is jewish both are equally incapable of granting and receiving emancipation | the christian state can only behave towards the jew in the manner of a christian state that is in a privileged manner by granting the separation of the jew from the other subjects but causing him to feel the pressure of the other separated spheres and all the more onerously inasmuch as the jew is in religious antagonism to the dominant religion | but the jew also can only conduct himself towards the state in a jewish fashion that is as a stranger by opposing his chimerical nationality to the real nationality his illusory law to the real law by imagining that his separation from humanity is justified by abstaining on principle from all participation in the historical movement by waiting on a future which has nothing in common with the general future of mankind by regarding himself as a member of the jewish people and the jewish people as the chosen people | upon what grounds therefore do you jews crave emancipation | on account of your religion | it is the mortal enemy of the state religion | as citizens | there are no citizens in germany | as men | you are as little men as he on whom you called | after giving a criticism of the previous positions and solutions of the question bauer has freshly posited the question of jewish emancipation | how he asks are they constituted the jew to be emancipated and the christian state which is to emancipate | he replies by a criticism of the jewish religion he analyses the religious antagonism between judaism and christianity he explains the nature of the christian state and all this with boldness acuteness spirit and thoroughness in a style as precise as it is forcible and energetic | how then does bauer solve the jewish question | what is the result | the formulation of a question is its solution | the criticism of the jewish question is the answer to the jewish question | the summary is therefore as follows: we must emancipate ourselves before we are able to emancipate others | the most rigid form of the antagonism between the jew and the christian is the religious antagonism | how is this antagonism resolved | by making it impossible | how is a religious antagonism made impossible | by abolishing religion | as soon as jew and christian recognize their respective religions as different stages in the development of the human mind as different snake skins which history has cast off and men as the snakes encased therein they stand no longer in a religious relationship but in a critical a scientific a human one | science then constitutes their unity | antagonisms in science however are resolved by science itself | the german jew is particularly affected by the lack of political emancipation in general and the pronounced christianity of the state | in bauer's sense however the jewish question has a general significance independent of the specific german conditions | it is the question of the relation of religion to the state of the contradiction between religious entanglement and political emancipation | emancipation from religion is posited as a condition both for the jews who desire to be politically emancipated and for the state which shall emancipate and itself be emancipated |  good you say and the jew says so too the jew also is not to be emancipated as jew not because he is a jew not because he has such an excellent general human principle of morality the jew will rather retire behind the citizen and be a citizen although he is a jew and wants to remain one: that is he is and remains a jew in spite of the fact that he is a citizen and lives in general human relationships: his jewish and limited nature always and eventually triumphs over his human and political obligations | the prejudice remains in spite of the fact that it has been outstripped by general principles | if however it remains it rather outstrips everything else |  only sophistically and to outward seeming would the jew be able to remain a jew in civic life if he desired to remain a jew the mere semblance would therefore be the essential thing and would triumph that is his life in the state would be only a semblance or a passing exception to the rule and the nature of things the capacity of modern jews and christians to become free p |57  let us see on the other hand how bauer describes the task of the state: france has recently proceedings of the chamber of deputies 26th december 1840 in connection with the jewish question as constantly in all other political questions given us a glimpse of a life which is free but revokes its freedom in law and therefore asserts it to be a sham and on the other hand contradicts its free law by its act |  the jewish question p |64   general freedom is not yet legal in france the jewish question is not yet solved because legal freedom that all citizens are equal is limited in practice which is still dominated by religious privileges and this unfreedom in practice reacts on the law compelling the latter to sanction the division of nominally free citizens into oppressed and oppressor p |65  when therefore would the jewish problem be solved for france |  the jew for instance must cease to be a jew if he will not allow himself to be hindered by his law from fulfilling his duties towards the state and his fellow citizens going for example to the chamber of deputies on the sabbath and taking part in the public sittings | every religious privilege and consequently the monopoly of a privileged church must be surrendered and if few or many or even the great majority believe they ought still to perform religious duties this performance must be left to themselves as a private matter p |65   when there is no longer a privileged religion there will no longer be a religion | take from religion its excommunicating power and it exists no longer p |66  on the one hand bauer states that the jew must abandon judaism and that man must abandon religion in order to be emancipated as a citizen | on the other hand he feels he is logical in interpreting the political abolition of religion to mean the abolition of religion altogether | the state which presupposes religion is as yet no true no real state |  at any rate the religious idea gives the state guarantees | but what state | what kind of state |p 97  at this point we are brought up against the one sided conception of the jewish question | it was by no means sufficient to inquire: who shall emancipate | who shall be emancipated | criticism had a third task to perform | it had to ask: what kind of emancipation are we concerned with | upon what conditions is the desired emancipation based | the criticism of political emancipation itself was only the eventual criticism of the jewish question and its true solution in the general question of the time | because bauer does not raise the question to this level he falls into contradictions | he posits conditions which are not involved in the nature of political emancipation itself | he suggests questions which his problem does not imply and he solves problems which leave his questions unsettled | whereas bauer says of the opponents of jewish emancipation: their mistake was that they assumed the christian state to be the only real state and did not subject it to the same criticism that they applied to judaism we find bauer's mistake to consist in the fact that it is only the christian state and not the general state that he subjects to criticism that he does not investigate the relation of political emancipation to human emancipation and consequently lays down conditions which are only explicable from an uncritical confusion of political emancipation with general human emancipation | when bauer asks jews: have you the right from your standpoint to crave political emancipation | we would inquire on the contrary: has the standpoint of political emancipation the right to demand of jews the abolition of judaism or from men generally the abolition of religion | the complexion of the jewish question changes according to the state in which jews find themselves | in germany where no political state no state as state exists the jewish question is a purely theological question | the jew finds himself in religious antagonism to the state which acknowledges christianity as its basis | this state is theologian ex professo | here criticism is criticism of theology is two edged criticism criticism of christian and criticism of jewish theology | but however critical we may be we cannot get out of the theological circle | in france in the constitutional state the jewish question is the question of constitutionalism of the incompleteness of political emancipation | as the semblance of a state religion is there preserved although in a meaningless and self contradictory formula in the formula of a religion of the majority the relationship of jews to the state retains the semblance of a religious and theological antagonism | it is only in the north american free states at least in part of them that the jewish question loses its theological significance and becomes a really secular question | only where the political state exists in its completeness can the relation of the jew of the religious man generally to the political state and therefore the relation of religion to the state be studied in its special features and its purity | the criticism of this relationship ceases to be theological criticism when the state ceases to adopt a theological attitude towards religion when its attitude towards religion becomes purely political | the criticism then becomes criticism of the political state | at this point where the question ceases to be theological bauer's criticism ceases to be critical | in the united states there is neither a state religion nor a religion declared to be that of the majority nor the predominance of one cult over another | the state is alien to all cults |  marie ou l'esclavage aux etats unis etc by g beaumont paris 1835 p |214  there are even north american states where the constitution does not impose religious beliefs or the practice of a cult as a condition of political privileges l c p |225  yet nobody in the united states believes that a man without religion might be an honest man l c p |224  yet north america is pre eminently the country of religiosity as beaumont tocqueville and the englishman hamilton assure us with one voice | meanwhile the north american states only serve us as an example | the question is: what is the attitude of completed political emancipation towards religion | if even in the country of completed political emancipation we find religion not only existing but in a fresh and vital state it proves that the existence of religion does not contradict the completeness of the state | but as the existence of religion indicates the presence of a defect the source of this defect may only be looked for in the nature of the state | we are no longer concerned with religion as the basis but only as the phenomenon of secular shortcomings | consequently we explain the religious handicap of the free citizens from their secular handicap | we do not assert that they must remove their religious handicap as soon as they cast off their secular fetters | we do not transform secular questions into theological questions | we transform theological questions into secular questions | after history has for so long been dissolved in superstition we dissolve the superstition in history | the question of the relation of political emancipation becomes for us the question of the relation of political emancipation to human emancipation | we criticize the religious weakness of the political state by criticizing the political state in its secular construction apart from the religious weaknesses | we transmute the contradiction of the state with a specific religion like judaism into the contradiction of the state with specific secular elements and the contradiction of the state with religion generally into the contradiction of the state with its general assumptions | the political emancipation of the jew of the christian of the religious man in general means the emancipation of the state from judaism from christianity from religion generally | in its form as state in the manner peculiar to its nature the state emancipates itself from religion by emancipating itself from the state religion that is by the state as state acknowledging no religion | political emancipation from religion is not a thorough going and consistent emancipation from religion because political emancipation is not effectual and consistent human emancipation | the limit of political emancipation is immediately seen to consist in the fact that the state can cast off a fetter without men really becoming free from it that the state can become a free state without men becoming free men | bauer tacitly assents to this in laying down the following condition for political emancipation | the state may therefore achieve emancipation from religion although the great majority are still religious | and the great majority do not cease to be religious by being religious privately | the political elevation of the individual above religion shares all the defects and all the advantages of political elevation generally | for example the state as state annuls private property the individual declares in a political manner that private property is abolished as soon as he abolishes the census for active and passive eligibility which has been done in many north american states | hamilton interprets this fact quite correctly from the political standpoint: the great multitude has won the victory over the property owners and the monied men | is not private property ideally abolished when the have nots become the legislators of the haves | the census is the last political form to recognize private property | yet private property is not only not abolished with the political annulment of private property but is even implied therein | the state abolishes in its fashion the distinctions of birth status education and occupation when it declares birth status education and occupation to be unpolitical distinctions when without taking account of these distinctions it calls upon every member of the community to participate in the popular sovereignty on an equal footing when it deals with all the elements of the real popular life from the state's point of view | nevertheless the state leaves private property education occupation operating in their own manner that is as education as occupation and developing their potentialities | from abolishing these actual distinctions it rather exists only upon their basis and is conscious of being a political state and enforcing its communal principle only in opposition to these its elements | consequently hegel defines the relation of the political state to religion quite correctly when he says: if the state is to have reality as the ethical self conscious realization of spirit it must be distinguished from the form of authority and faith | but this distinction arises only in so far as the ecclesiastical side is in itself divided into several churches | then only is the state seen to be superior to them and wins and brings into existence the universality of thought as the principle of its form |  philosophy of right eng |tr p 270  by its nature the completed political state is the generic life of man in contradistinction to his material life | all the assumptions of this egoistic life remain in existence outside the sphere of the state in bourgeois society but as the peculiarities of bourgeois society | of course there were some in whom even the broadest charity could find little to approve but it was her purpose to study and understand them and lose forever the unsophisticated ignorance at which graydon had used to laugh | santa barbara was a winter resort and she had the advantage of meeting many types | in mrs wayland she had a useful mentor | this lady in her younger days had been familiar with the best phases of metropolitan society and she counteracted in madge all tendencies toward provincialism | thus it gradually became recognized that the shy sickly little girl as she had been characterized at first was growing into a very attractive young woman | indeed after an absence of only a year her own sister would scarcely have recognized her | chapter v achievement mrs muir of course heard often from her sister and was satisfied with the general assurance that she was better and steadily improving | madge however was rather indefinite in her information | as time passed the idea of giving her friends in the east a surprise took possession of her fancy | she instinctively felt that she needed every incentive to pursue the course she had resolved upon since she often suffered from fits of depression hard to combat | the hope of appearing like a new being to her relatives was another innocent motive for her long prolonged effort | circumstances had never developed epistolary tastes in the sisters and they were content with brief missives containing general assurances that all was well | mrs muir was one of those ladies who become engrossed with the actual and the present | had madge been in her old room she would have been looked after with daily solicitude being absent she was loved none the less but was simply crowded from thought and memory by swarms of little cares | she was doing well and her sister was satisfied |  'it's a wonderful climate ' madge writes she would say so even and dry | madge doesn't take cold as she did here and can go out nearly every day | perhaps we ought to become reconciled to the fact that she will have to live there always since here with our sudden changes she could scarcely live at all | with the kindliest intentions graydon had sought to initiate a vigorous correspondence | he had learned with immense relief of madge's improvement through change of residence and he felt that a series of jolly letters might bring aid and hopefulness | her responses were not very encouraging however and business cares with the novelty of foreign life gradually absorbed his thoughts and time until correspondence languished and died |  it's the old story he thought with a shade of irritation |  letters cost effort and she is not equal to effort or thinks she is not | if he could have seen madge at that moment riding like the wind on a spirited horse he would have been more astonished than by any of the wonders of the old world | he died shortly after and scandalous stories of her intimacy with her brother caused her removal to constantinople but she came back again and reigned long as the regent of her son valentinian iii a feeble youth who never grew to have either passions or talents and was very likely as was said enervated by his mother in dissolute indulgence so that she might be supreme | but she died at rome in 450 much praised for her orthodoxy and her devotion to the trinity | and there was her daughter honoria who ran off with a chamberlain and afterward offered to throw herself into the arms of attila who wouldn't take her as a gift at first but afterward demanded her and fought to win her and her supposed inheritance | but they were a bad lot altogether and it is no credit to a christian of the nineteenth century to stay in this tomb so long | near this mausoleum is the magnificent basilica of st vitale built in the reign of justinian and consecrated in 547 i was interested to see it because it was erected in confessed imitation of st sophia at constantinople is in the octagonal form and has all the accessories of eastern splendor according to the architectural authorities | its effect is really rich and splendid and it rather dazzled us with its maze of pillars its upper and lower columns its galleries complicated capitals arches on arches and byzantine intricacies | to the student of the very early ecclesiastical art it must be an object of more interest than even of wonder | but what i cared most to see were the mosaics in the choir executed in the time of justinian and as fresh and beautiful as on the day they were made | the mosaics and the exquisite arabesques on the roof of the choir taken together are certainly unequaled by any other early church decoration i have seen and they are as interesting as they are beautiful | any description of them is impossible but mention may be made of two characteristic groups remarkable for execution and having yet a deeper interest | in one compartment of the tribune is the figure of the emperor justinian holding a vase with consecrated offerings and surrounded by courtiers and soldiers | opposite is the figure of the empress theodora holding a similar vase and attended by ladies of her court | there is a refinement and an elegance about the empress a grace and sweet dignity that is fascinating | this is royalty stately and cold perhaps: even the mouth may be a little cruel i begin to perceive as i think of her but she wears the purple by divine right | i have not seen on any walls any figure walking out of history so captivating as this lady who would seem to have been worthy of apotheosis in a christian edifice | can there be any doubt that this lovely woman was orthodox | she also has a story which you doubtless have been recalling as you read | is it worth while to repeat even its outlines | this charming regal woman was the daughter of the keeper of the bears in the circus at constantinople and she early went upon the stage as a pantomimist and buffoon | she was beautiful with regular features a little pale but with a tinge of natural color vivacious eyes and an easy motion that displayed to advantage the graces of her small but elegant figure | i can see all that in the mosaic | but she sold her charms to whoever cared to buy them in constantinople she led a life of dissipation that cannot be even hinted at in these days she went off to egypt as the concubine of a general was deserted and destitute even to misery in cairo wandered about a vagabond in many eastern cities and won the reputation everywhere of the most beautiful courtesan of her time reappeared in constantinople and having it is said a vision of her future suddenly took to a pretension of virtue and plain sewing contrived to gain the notice of justinian to inflame his passions as she did those of all the world besides to captivate him into first an alliance and at length a marriage | the emperor raised her to an equal seat with himself on his throne and she was worshiped as empress in that city where she had been admired as harlot | and on the throne she was a wise woman courageous and chaste and had her palaces on the bosphorus and took good care of her beauty and indulged in the pleasures of a good table had ministers who kissed her feet a crowd of women and eunuchs in her secret chambers whose passions she indulged was avaricious and sometimes cruel and founded a convent for the irreclaimably bad of her own sex some of whom liked it and some of whom threw themselves into the sea in despair and when she died was an irreparable loss to her emperor | so that it seems to me it is a pity that the historian should say that she was devout but a little heretic | a high day in rome palm sunday in st peter's the splendid and tiresome ceremonies of holy week set in also the rain which held up for two days | rome without the sun and with rain and the bone penetrating damp cold of the season is a wretched place | squalor and ruins and cheap splendor need the sun the galleries need it the black old masters in the dark corners of the gaudy churches need it i think scarcely anything of a cardinal's big blazing footman unless the sun shines on him and radiates from his broad back and his splendid calves the models who get up in theatrical costumes and get put into pictures and pass the world over for roman peasants and beautiful many of them are can't sit on the spanish stairs in indolent pose when it rains the streets are slimy and horrible the carriages try to run over you and stand a very good chance of succeeding where there are no sidewalks and you are limping along on the slippery round cobble stones you can't get into the country which is the best part of rome: but when the sun shines all this is changed the dear old dirty town exercises its fascinations on you then and you speedily forget your recent misery | holy week is a vexation to most people | all the world crowds here to see its exhibitions and theatrical shows and works hard to catch a glimpse of them and is tired out if not disgusted at the end | the things to see and hear are palm sunday in st peter's singing of the miserere by the pope's choir on wednesday thursday and friday in the sistine chapel washing of the pilgrims' feet in a chapel of st peter's and serving the apostles at table by the pope on thursday with a papal benediction from the balcony afterwards easter sunday with the illumination of st peter's in the evening and fireworks this year in front of st peter's in montorio monday evening | raised seats are built up about the high altar under the dome in st peter's which will accommodate a thousand and perhaps more ladies and for these tickets are issued without numbers and for twice as many as they will seat | gentlemen who are in evening dress are admitted to stand in the reserved places inside the lines of soldiers | for the miserere in the sistine chapel tickets are also issued | as there is only room for about four hundred ladies and a thousand and more tickets are given out you may imagine the scramble | ladies go for hours before the singing begins and make a grand rush when the doors are open | i do not know any sight so unseemly and cruel as a crowd of women intent on getting in to such a ceremony: they are perfectly rude and unmerciful to each other | they push and trample one another under foot veils and dresses are torn ladies faint away in the scrimmage and only the strongest and most unscrupulous get in | i have heard some say who have been in the pellmell that not content with elbowing and pushing and pounding some women even stick pins into those who are in the way | i hope this latter is not true but it is certain that the conduct of most of the women is brutal | a weak or modest or timid woman stands no more chance than she would in a herd of infuriated campagna cattle | the same scenes are enacted in the efforts to see the pope wash feet and serve at the table | for the possession of the seats under the dome on palm sunday and easter there is a like crush | the ceremonies do not begin until half past nine but ladies go between five and six o'clock in the morning and when the passages are open they make a grand rush | the seats except those saved for the nobility are soon all taken and the ladies who come after seven are lucky if they can get within the charmed circle and find a spot to sit down on a campstool | they can then see only a part of the proceedings and have a weary exhausting time of it for hours | this year rome is more crowded than ever before | there are american ladies enough to fill all the reserved places and i fear they are energetic enough to get their share of them | it rained sunday but there was a steady stream of people and carriages all the morning pouring over the bridge of st angelo and discharging into the piazza of st peter's | it was after nine when i arrived on the ground | there was a crowd of carriages under the colonnades and a heavy fringe in front of them but the hundreds of people moving over the piazza and up the steps to the entrances made only the impression of dozens in the vast space | i do not know if there are people enough in rome to fill st peter's certainly there was no appearance of a crowd as we entered although they had been pouring in all the morning and still thronged the doors | i heard a traveler say that he followed ten thousand soldiers into the church and then lost them from sight: they disappeared in the side chapels | he did not make his affidavit as to the number of soldiers | the interior area of the building is not much greater than the square of st mark in venice | to go into the great edifice is almost like going outdoors | lines of soldiers kept a wide passage clear from the front door away down to the high altar and there was a good mass of spectators on the outside | the tribunes for the ladies built up under the dome were of course filled with masses of ladies in solemn black and there was more or less of a press of people surging about in that vicinity | thousands of people were also roaming about in the great spaces of the edifice but there was nowhere else anything like a crowd | it had very much the appearance of a large fair ground with little crowds about favorite booths | gentlemen in dress coats were admitted to the circle under the dome | the pope's choir was stationed in a gallery there opposite the high altar | back of the altar was a wide space for the dignitaries seats were there also for ambassadors and those born to the purple and the pope's seat was on a raised dais at the end | outsiders could see nothing of what went on within there and the ladies under the dome could only partially see in the seats they had fought so gallantly to obtain | st peter's is a good place for grand processions and ceremonies but it is a poor one for viewing them | a procession which moves down the nave is hidden by the soldiers who stand on either side or is visible only by sections as it passes: there is no good place to get the grand effect of the masses of color and the total of the gorgeous pageantry | i should like to see the display upon a grand stage and enjoy it in a coup d'oeil | it is a fine study of color and effect and the groupings are admirable but the whole affair is nearly lost to the mass of spectators | it must be a sublime feeling to one in the procession to walk about in such monstrous fine clothes but what would his emotions be if more people could see him | the grand altar stuck up under the dome not only breaks the effect of what would be the fine sweep of the nave back to the apse but it cuts off all view of the celebration of the mass behind it and in effect reduces what should be the great point of display in the church to a mere chapel | and when you add to that the temporary tribunes erected under the dome for seating the ladies the entire nave is shut off from a view of the gorgeous ceremony of high mass | the effect would be incomparable if one could stand in the door or anywhere in the nave and as in other churches look down to the end upon a great platform with the high altar and all the sublime spectacle in full view with the blaze of candles and the clouds of incense rising in the distance | at half past nine the great doors opened and the procession began in slow and stately moving fashion to enter | one saw a throng of ecclesiastics in robes and ermine the white plumes of the guard noble the pages and chamberlains in scarlet other pages or what not in black short clothes short swords gold chains cloak hanging from the shoulder and stiff white ruffs thirty six cardinals in violet robes with high miter shaped white silk hats that looked not unlike the pasteboard trainer caps that boys wear when they play soldier crucifixes and a blazoned banner here and there and at last the pope in his red chair borne on the shoulders of red lackeys heaving along in a sea sicky motion clad in scarlet and gold with a silver miter on his head feebly making the papal benediction with two upraised fingers and moving his lips in blessing | as the pope came in a supplementary choir of men and soprano hybrids stationed near the door set up a high welcoming song or chant which echoed rather finely through the building | all the music of the day is vocal | the procession having reached its destination and disappeared behind the altar of the dome the pope dismounted and took his seat on his throne | the blessing of the palms began the cardinals first approaching and afterwards the members of the diplomatic corps the archbishops and bishops the heads of the religious orders and such private persons as have had permission to do so | i had previously seen the palms carried in by servants in great baskets | it is perhaps not necessary to say that they are not the poetical green waving palms but stiff sort of wands woven out of dry yellow split palm leaves sometimes four or five feet in length braided into the semblance of a crown on top a kind of rough basket work | the palms having been blessed a procession was again formed down the nave and out the door all in it carrying palms in their hands the yellow color of which added a new element of picturesqueness to the splendid pageant | the pope was carried as before and bore in his hand a short braided palm with gold woven in flowers added and the monogram i h |s  worked in the top | it is the pope's custom to give this away when the ceremony is over | last year he presented it to an american lady whose devotion attracted him this year i saw it go away in a gilded coach in the hands of an ecclesiastic | the procession disappeared through the great portal into the vestibule and the door closed | in a moment somebody knocked three times on the door: it opened and the procession returned and moved again to the rear of the altar the singers marching with it and chanting | the cardinals then changed their violet for scarlet robes and high mass for an hour was celebrated by a cardinal priest: and i was told that it was the pope's voice that we heard high and clear singing the passion | the choir made the responses and performed at intervals | the singing was not without a certain power indeed it was marvelous how some of the voices really filled the vast spaces of the edifice and the choruses rolled in solemn waves of sound through the arches | the singing with the male sopranos is not to my taste but it cannot be denied that it had a wild and strange effect | she often has great powers of discernment but will not take the trouble to use them unless prompted by her own interests | selfishness is too short sighted however to secure lasting benefits | usually nothing is more fatal than the success of mere self seeking | while madge pressed unwaveringly toward the goal of her hopes she did not do so in thoughtless or callous indifference toward those who had true claims upon her | with her sister she soon saw that all was well that she was as before absorbed and content with the routine of her life | she was not so sure about her brother in law | during her absence lines of care had appeared in his face and there was an abstracted and sometimes a troubled look in his eyes as if he was pursued by questions that were importunate and even threatening | the indications of perturbation were slight indeed but from his nature they would be so in any case | thus the young girl also received an impression which awakened a faint solicitude | mr muir as her guardian and the manager of her property had been a true friend and loyal to his trust | she entertained for him much respect and a strong quiet affection | he did not dwell in her thoughts merely as one who was useful to her but rather as one who had been true to her and to whom she in her place and way would be true and sympathetic were there occasion | madge was wearied indeed by her long journey but not exhausted | in sensations so different from those which had followed her journey to the west she recognized her immeasurable gain | then she had entered mrs wayland's cottage helpless hopeless a fugitive from her own weakness | by wise endeavor she had transformed that very weakness into her strength and had returned to the scenes from which she had fled earnest and resolute one who had made her choice for life and would abide by it | womanly to her very finger tips she was acting with the aggressive decision of a man | sensitive and timid beyond most women she would not lose her happiness when it might be won in paths not only hedged about by all the proprieties of her lot but also by a reserve and pride with which her own fine nature was pre eminently endowed | that she loved graydon muir was a truth for life | if he could learn to love her from what she had sought to be from what she simply was he should have the chance | her own deep experience had taught her much and given her the clew to many things | she had studied life not only in books but in its actual manifestations | mrs wayland was a social mine in herself and could recall from the past volumes of dispassionate gossip free from malice | in two years madge had learned to know the world better than many who are in contact with it for long periods but who see all through the distorted medium of their own prejudices or exceptional experiences | although she was no longer unsophisticated she was neither cynical nor optimistic | before her hope could be fulfilled she knew she must enter society and she studied it thoughtfully its whims and meannesses as well as its laws and refinements | if she ever reached graydon's side she meant to stand there with a knowledge and confidence as assured as his own | she soon learned that it is common enough for women to seek to win men by every alluring and coquettish device | she would employ no devices whatever | she would merely reappear above his horizon among other luminaries and shine with her own pure unborrowed light | then it must depend upon himself whether she ever became his own bright particular star | so much she felt she had a right to do and no conventional hesitation as to her course stood in her way | her love had become the governing impulse of her life and its dictates were imperative until they trenched upon her sensitive womanly pride | then they were met as the rock meets the tide | she did not care what the world might think: it should never have occasion to think at all | her secret was between herself and god | graydon himself should never know it unless his name became hers | how vividly her old haunts recalled him | there was the lounge on which he used to toss the little wraith after having carried her around in the semblance of a waltz | the sofa on which had taken place their strange parting still stood as of old in her room | there her head had sunk in unconsciousness upon his breast the result of her vain feeble struggle to escape from caresses so natural to him but no longer to be received by her | what way marks in life mute commonplace things become in the light of memory | to her vivid fancy graydon was again present in all the positions now made memorable by deep affection | the past unrolled itself again as it had so often done before | she saw the pallid frightened child that scarcely dared to look deprecatingly at the handsome young collegian | she saw again the kind yet mirthful eyes that beamed encouragingly upon her | she remembered that in the unworthy past they had ever looked upon her with a large gentle affectionate tolerance and she now took chiefly upon herself the blame for those years of weakness | her present radiant health and beauty proved how unnecessary they had been and her heart sometimes sunk at the thought of what they might cost her | mary had accompanied her to her room and was asked in a careless tone what had become of miss wildmere |  i was told incidentally the other day that she was as great a belle as ever | i had hoped that she would be out of graydon's way before this time | i have heard however that great belles are often slower in marrying than the homeliest girls | if all is true that is said this miss wildmere has made mischief enough but i am not anxious that our graydon should cut short her career that is if marriage would cut it short | i imagine she will always be a gay society woman | well madge i suppose you must make up your mind to be a belle yourself | why don't you cut out this 'speculator ' as my husband calls her | if graydon had my eyes it wouldn't be a difficult task |  graydon hasn't your eyes or mine either was the brusque reply |  i propose to use my own | they may see some one that i have never met | one thing at least is certain i don't intend to cut out miss wildmere or any one else | the man who wins me will have to do the seeking most emphatically and i warn you beforehand sister mine that you must never let the idea of matchmaking enter your head | since i have been away i have developed more will of my own than muscle | there is no necessity for me ever to marry and if i do it will be because i wish to not because any one else wants me to | nothing would set me against a man more certainly than to see that he had allies who were manoeuvring in his behalf and she concluded with a kiss that robbed her words of a point too sharp perhaps for her sister's feelings | she knew mrs muir's peculiarities well enough however to believe that such words were needed and she had intended to speak them in some form at the earliest opportunity | therefore she was glad that she could utter the warning so early and naturally in their new relations | nor was it uncalled for since the thought of bringing madge and graydon together had already entered mrs muir's mind | a scheme of this character would grow in fascination every hour | poor madge was well aware that with the best intentions no one could more certainly blast her hopes than her sister whose efforts would be unaccompanied by the nicest tact | moreover any such attempts might involve the disclosure of her secret |  well you have changed in every respect said mary looking at her wonderingly |  for the better i hope | my feeling in this respect however seems to me perfectly natural | i don't see how a self respecting girl could endure anything except a straightforward downright suit with plenty of time to make up her own mind | i can do without the man who does not think me worthy of this and could probably do without him any way | because a man wants to marry a girl is only one reason for assent and there may be a dozen reasons to the contrary |  why madge how you talk | when you left us it seemed as if any one might pick you up and marry you and you would not have spirit enough to say yes or no | have you had to refuse any one at santa barbara | perhaps you didn't refuse | you have told me so little of what was going on |  that isn't fair to me mary | i explained to you that i wished to give you a pleasant surprise | to plan a pleasure for you was not unsisterly was it | i haven't miss wildmere's ambition for miscellaneous conquests | why should i write about men for whom i cared nothing and toward whom my manner should have made my spoken negative unnecessary |  other girls would | well it seems that their suit was downright enough to satisfy you | good gracious | how many were there | madge laughed yawned and her sister saw that her dark eyes were full of the languor of sleep which added to their beauty |  oh not many she drawled |  i'll gossip about them some time when not so tired | i'll indicate them by numerals | why should i babble their names in connection with what they called so sacred | i wonder how many like sacred affairs had occurred before | if i tell you the story of the wooing of number one two three and so on that will answer just as well won't it |  no indeed | i wish to know their names family connection and whether they were well off or not | madge again laughed and began to disrobe in order to indicate that their confidence must at least be adjourned for the present | her sister came and felt her perfect arms and rounded gleaming shoulders |  why madge she exclaimed your flesh is as white and smooth as ivory and almost as firm to the touch | it's a wonderful transformation | i can scarcely believe much less understand it | you have grown so beautiful that you almost turn even my head |  there is nothing so wonderful about it mary | almost any girl may win health and therefore more or less beauty if she has the sense and will to make the effort | you know what i was when i left home | i suggested doctors' bills more than anything else and it was chiefly my fault and she sighed deeply |  when i went to work in a rational way to get strong i succeeded | i believe this would be true with the great majority | good night dear | when i am rested i'm going to help you in many ways in return for all you did for that lazy lackadaisical limp little nonentity that you used to dose and coddle when you should have given her a good shaking |  it's all a miracle said mrs muir to her husband at the conclusion of lengthy remarks about madge |  as much a miracle as my fortune was the quiet reply |  madge has had sense enough to know what she wanted and how to get it | chapter vii not a miracle madge was simply fatigued from her long journey and not oppressed with want of sleep for in passing through uninteresting portions of the country she had given herself up to repose | the sense of weariness passed with the hours of night and she was among the earliest stirring in the morning | long before breakfast was ready she had her trunks partially unpacked her mind meantime busy with plans for immediate action | at last her healthful appetite so asserted itself that she went down to the dining room | mr and mrs muir had not yet appeared and she strolled into the parlor opened her piano and played a few runs | she found it sadly out of tune from long disuse | as this was not true of her voice she began singing a favorite german song | in a moment the house was full of melody | clear sweet and powerful her notes penetrated to the kitchen where the maids were busy and they stopped in spellbound wonder with dish or utensil in hand | mrs muir listened with her hair brush suspended while methodical mr muir laid down his razor and going to the door set it ajar | the song poured into the room like an harmonic flood | before the first stanza was completed mrs muir had on her dressing gown and was stealing downstairs into the back parlor and as madge was beginning again she rushed upon her |  why why she exclaimed i thought nilsson or patti had got lost and taken refuge here | can it be you | you are nothing but a surprise from beginning to end | when will the wonders cease | are you sure that you are madge |  yes and equally sure that i am hungry | when will you be ready for breakfast | i've been up these two hours |  well well well what will graydon say | he thinks you are still little better than a ghost |  he will say that i have been very sensible and he will find me very substantial and matter of fact | the question now uppermost is when will breakfast be ready | cried the young girl laughing in a childlike enjoyment of her sister's wonder and a loving woman's anticipation of triumph over the man who had once called her weak and lackadaisical | she responded warmly to the embrace of mrs muir who added you have come back to us a princess | why even henry whom nothing moves out of the even tenor of his way paused in his shaving and with one side of his face all lathered opened the door to listen |  you tell him cried madge in merry vein that he has given me the greatest compliment i ever received | but compliments are not breakfast | mrs muir returned to complete her toilet and her husband soon appeared |  madge he said greeting her kindly you have brought about great changes | how have you accomplished them all in so brief a time |  the time has not been so very brief she replied |  i have been away over two years remember | it's all very simple henry | i went to work to get well and to learn something as you give your mind and time to business | in the waylands my old german professor and especially in the magnificent climate i had splendid allies | and you know i had nothing else to do | one can do a great deal in two years with sufficient motive and steady effort toward a few points |  what was your motive madge | a slow deep color stole into her face but she looked unflinchingly into his eyes as she asked was not the hope of being what i am to day compared with what i was sufficient motive |  yes he replied thoughtfully it was but it appears strange to me that more girls do not show your sense | nine tenths of the pallid creatures that i see continue half alive through their own fault |  if they knew the pleasure of being thoroughly alive said madge they wouldn't dawdle another hour | i believe that i might have regained health long before if i had set about it |  well madge as your guardian i wish to tell you that i am deeply gratified | you have done more for yourself than all the world could do for you | i am a plain man you know and not given to many words | there is only one thing that i detest more than a silly woman and that is a heartless speculating one | both are sure to make trouble sooner or later | you certainly do not belong to the first type and i don't believe you will ever make a bad use of the beauty you have won so honestly | let me give you a bit of business experience madge | i have seen men falter and fail by the score downtown and usually it was because women were playing the mischief with them too often women of their own households who had no more idea of the worth of a dollar or how it is obtained than a kitten | the one idea is to marry for money and then to spend it in parade | i believe you will be like your sister mary who has given me a home quiet and peace |  if i ever give a man anything i'll give him a great deal more than that madge thought |  and now concluded mr muir speaking of money i wish to go over your accounts with you soon that you may know everything and understand everything | it's absurd for women to be helpless and dependent in this respect | you should know all about your property and the time has come when you should learn what are regarded as safe investments and what are not | my life is as uncertain as any other man's and i intend that you sisters shall not be like two children who must do blindly what some trustee tells you to do and mr muir complacently led the way to the breakfast room feeling that as guardian he had done his duty both morally and financially | it was his way to speak plainly and promptly all he desired to say and then according to his creed if people had sense they would do what was wise if they had not the less said the better | mrs muir was voluble during the morning meal | now that madge had come again within the sphere of her domestic energy she was fall of plans and projects |  of course she said you have nothing to wear | the outlandish dresses that you had made at that jumping off place in the west won't answer | as soon as the waylands have made their call we must go out and begin ordering your summer outfit | perhaps mrs wayland will go with us |  patience mary | we are not ready to order outfits yet |  why not |  because we do not want to buy what interested shopmen and milliners may choose to palm off on us | you live such a domestic life that you are scarcely better informed than i as to the latest modes | we will drive in the park use our eyes on the avenue and visit several fashionable establishments first | then i wish to find a dressmaker who is not an idiotic slave of fashion and who can modify the prevailing styles by taste and appreciation of the person for whom she works | the one whom i employ must make dresses for me and under my direction and not dresses in the abstract as if they were for the iron framed form on which she exhibits her wares | good  cried mr muir madge's head is level | let her have her own way mary and she will come out all right |  well said mrs muir i suppose it will take a little time for me to get used to all these changes | before she went away i used to do everything for her | i'm going to have my own way in one thing however | you must not write to graydon a word beyond the fact that madge is here | you have both laughed at me and my wonder and i'm going to have the compensation of seeing him transformed into exclamation points | madge now turned toward mr muir and he could detect not the slightest indication of embarrassment or overconsciousness as she said certainly henry you must not spoil this little bit of prospective fun | madge did have her own way and made her preparations with the quiet decision and thoughtfulness which now characterized her actions | the waylands were frequent guests at mr muir's home for a time and then departed to visit friends in the country | madge and her sister soon decided upon the catskills as the place of their summer sojourn | the choice of this region so accessible from the city was pleasing to mr muir |  what are you reading | he said one evening as he found madge surrounded by books and pamphlets |  reading up on the catskills and their vicinity | a place is far more interesting if you have associations with it and i intend to be versed in all the stories and legends of the region | in this i have a little design upon you also | you look worn henry and need rest and change | you are too much devoted to business | i'm going to 'frivol ' like the rest of the girls in the evening dance and all that you know but i shall try to keep you among the hills and inveigle you into long drives and walks by telling you exciting yarns that will take the place of the dissipations of business | you needn't think you will have to mope around the piazza your body on a mountain and your mind in wall street | you are getting old and rich and you must begin to take an interest in other things besides business |  now that's thoughtful and kind of you he said and then he lapsed into a revery that the contraction of his brow showed to be not altogether agreeable | at last he said madge i half believe you are right | i am and have been too devoted to business | it's all very well as long as you can drive it but when it begins to drive you it is a hard task master | the times are bad | instead of making anything one has to use all his faculties to keep from losing what he has made | it's getting to be a grind | i sometimes wish i was out of it but suppose i shouldn't know what to do with myself |  that's just it henry you wouldn't | you must become interested in other things and that's a process which requires time and i'll help you |  oh you he said laughing you will soon have all you can do to keep your beaux at bay |  beaux in this free and enlightened land have only certain rights which a girl is bound to respect | should there be any and they unreasonable you'll see she said with a little decisive nod | then she added gravely: i don't believe you would be content out of business but i should think there was such a thing as trying to do so much business that it would become a burden and perhaps a heavy one | you may think i'm a little goose talking of what i know nothing about but i've read a great deal and of late books worth reading | i don't believe it is a good thing to change one's habits and pursuits suddenly and what's more henry i believe that when the times are better business will be as great a source of satisfaction to you as ever | as i suggested before you must gradually become interested in other things which can take the place of business as you grow old |  what a wise little woman we have become | said mr muir |  here you are giving your guardian sound advice you who i imagined once would take no more thought for the morrow than a lily of the field and a very pale one at that | this is a greater change than any that mary exclaims about |  perhaps you think me very presuming answered madge coloring |  no i do not | i think you very sensible and i think myself very fortunate in having such women in my household as you and mary | i was blue when i came home to night but it inspirits a man to talk to such a girl | you have a power of good common sense madge |  well i have i had need of it |  the majority would say you could afford to be silly | you have a snug fortune of your own of which not a penny can be lost unless the bottom falls out of everything |  i don't think any woman can afford to be silly | i know that's a sweeping word with you and covers all feminine folly | what i meant is this: money and every good thing in life was a mockery | i couldn't enjoy anything and wasn't anything but a burden | i saw it all and that i should have to throw nonsense overboard if i wished to be different | you will find that i have plenty left however before the summer's over | now let me read to you irving's legend of poor old rip | what if you have read it often | a little infusion of the champion sleeper's spirit is just what you need and with simple purity of tone and naturalness of accent she made the old story new to him |  madge he said as he kissed her good night that is even better than your singing | i feel so freshened and heartened up that i'm another man and in good trim for the fight to morrow for that is just what business has become a regular defensive fight | you didn't think two years ago that you would send me down to wall street with a clearer head and better courage |  no indeed i didn't dream of it and i can scarcely believe it's true now | you used to seem to me like gravitation that would always be the same to the end of time | bah  a man is only a man and he finds it out sooner or later | there's jack crying again and mary hasn't had a chance to come down | i'll take the child for his teeth make him so nervous that he won't stay with the nurse |  i'll try my hand at him to morrow said the young girl and was absorbed in her reading again | the days passed quickly and madge filled them full as before at santa barbara | as the time approached for graydon's return she felt a quiet rising excitement akin to that which inspires a soldier when a campaign is about to open but to her brother in law and sister she gave only the impression of decision of character and youthful healthful buoyancy | she was good cheer itself in the household and helpful in every little domestic emergency | the servants and the children welcomed her like sunshine and she made the evenings all too short by music and reading aloud | she blossomed out in her summer costumes like a flower so becoming to her style had been her choice of fabrics and the taste with which they had been fashioned | june was passing | in a day or two more graydon would arrive and the fruition or failure of her patient endeavor begin | chapter viii rival girls instead of graydon there came a letter saying that he would be detained abroad another week | the heat was oppressive and the family physician said that little jack should be taken to the country at once | therefore they packed in haste and started for a hotel in the catskills at which rooms had been engaged | graydon was to join them there as soon after his return as possible | madge looked wistfully at the mountains as with shadowy grandeur they loomed in the distance | there is ever a solemnity about mountain scenery and she felt it as she passed under the lofty brows of wooded heights | to her spirit it was grateful and appropriate for while she would lead among them apparently the existence of a young girl bent only on enjoyment she believed she would leave them either a happy woman or else facing the tragedy of a thwarted life | their deepest shadows might even when her laugh was gayest typify the despondency she would hide from all | it was saturday and mr muir accompanied his family | he and his wife looked worn and weary for at this time circumstances were bringing an excess of care to both | mrs muir was a devoted mother and little jack had taxed her patience and strength to the utmost | a defensive warfare is ever the severest test of manhood and mr muir had found the past week a trying one | he had been lured into an enterprise that at the time had seemed certain of success even to his conservative mind but unforeseen elements had entered into the problem and it now required all his nerve all his resources to meet the strain | neither madge nor his wife knew anything of this | indeed it was not his habit to speak of his affairs to any one unless the exigencies of the case required explanation | in this emergency he was obliged to maintain among his associates an air of absolute confidence | now that he was out of the arena he gave evidence of the strain | madge saw this and resolved that her large reserve of vitality should be drawn upon | the tired mother should be relieved and the perplexed and wearied man beguiled into forgetfulness of the sources of anxiety | jack would have indulged in a perpetual howl during the journey had not his attention been diverted by madge's unexpected expedients which often suspended an outcry with comical abruptness while her remarks and questions made it impossible for mr muir to toil on mentally in wall street | by reason of the heat the majority of the passengers dozed or fretted | she heroically kept up the spirits of her little band oblivious of the admiring eyes that often turned toward her flushed animated face | there are few stronger tests than unflagging good humor during a disagreeable journey with cross children | at last the ordeal came to an end and in the late afternoon shadows they alighted at the wide piazza of the under cliff house and were shown to airy rooms which proved that the guests were not kept in pigeon holes for the sole benefit of the proprietor | our heroine employed the best magic the world has known thoughtful helpfulness | mr muir was banished |  you would be as useful as a whale she said to him when he offered to aid his wife in unpacking and getting settled |  go down to the piazza and smoke in peace | i shall be worth a dozen of you as soon as i take off my travelling dress | she verified her words and before they were aware of it mrs muir who was prone to fall into hopeless confusion at such times and the nurse were acting under her direction | the elder little boy and girl were coaxed restrained managed and soon sent down to their father redressed and serene | jack was lulled to sleep in madge's room | the trunks instead of disgorging chaos were compelled to part with their contents in an orderly way | in little more than an hour the two rooms allotted to mr and mrs muir and the nurse with the children took on a cosey inhabitable aspect and by supper time the ladies in evening costume and with unruffled brows joined mr muir |  the idea of my ever permitting madge to go back to santa barbara | exclaimed mrs muir |  this day alone has proved that i can never get on without her | just go and look at your room sir | one would think we had been settled here a week | you ought to pay madge's bills and give her a handsome surplus |  if time is money said madge henry will have to pay me well | he must stay and help me explore these mountains in every direction | but now let us eat drink and be merry for to morrow we shall go to church |  i've half a mind to take you down to wall street with me next week said mr muir |  perhaps you can straighten out things there |  no sir | i'm a woman's rights girl and one of her rights is to get things out of the way as soon as possible so that people can have a good time | thank heaven our affairs can be shut up in drawers and hung up in closets and there we can leave them in this case for a good supper first and a long quiet rest on this piazza afterward | don't you think you could find a drawer somewhere in which to tuck away your wall street matters henry | you won't need them till some time next week for you must certainly spend two or three days with us | mr muir laughed |  i've heard of managing women before but you beat them all | you have won to day the right to manage for a while | i'll join you soon then supper and as you suggest i'll put the wall street matters somewhere and lock them up | thus their mountain sojourn began auspiciously | the supper was excellent and they were in a mood to enjoy it they found the piazza deliciously cool after the long hot day and the faint initial pipings of autumn insects only emphasized the peace and quiet of the evening | the mountains brooded around them like great shadows their outlines gemmed with stars and the very genius of repose seemed to settle down upon the weary man and woman who were in the thick of their life's battle | they were among the earliest arrivals at the house and had a wide space to themselves | indeed they could have been scarcely more secluded at their own summer residence | for those seeking rest an early flight to summer resorts brings a rich reward | while her relatives dozed or merely revived sufficiently from time to time to make some desultory remark madge thought deeply | at first she had been disappointed at the postponement of graydon's return but she grew reconciled as she dwelt upon it | while hope was deferred she enjoyed a longer lease of anticipation | when he did come she might soon learn that all hope was vain | besides the delay gave her time to familiarize herself with the region and its most beautiful walks and drives | the mountains woods and rocks should all be pressed into her service | they would not reveal her secret and they might engender thoughts and words with which miss wildmere would be out of harmony |  i've been thinking mr muir at last remarked | nonsense  you've been asleep madge replied |  no i've thought profoundly |  not even a penny for any thoughts of yours since supper |  they would be worth fortunes life health happiness to half the world |  then keep still till you have a patent copyright or something said his wife | no  i rise simply to remark also to retire that a little oil keeps machinery from wearing out and going to pieces | come now old lady pulling his wife to her feet you are the better to night as i am for the oil that madge has slipped in here and there | i fear the machinery to day would have run badly without it | the group that gathered at the breakfast table next morning bore early testimony to the tonic of the hills | jack only was not so well and mrs muir remained with him while madge and mr muir wended their way to a little chapel whose spire was the only summons to worship | a short genial middle aged man met them at the door with such hospitable cordiality as to suggest that he was receiving friends at his own home and conducted them to seats | a venerable clergyman sat in the pulpit with a face full of quiet benignity | every one who came appeared to receive an almost personal welcome and madge and mr muir looked enviously at the self appointed usher | it was as evident that he was not a professional sexton as that the little congregation could not afford such a luxury | no care clouded his brow | evidently his future did not depend on fluctuations in the maelstrom of commerce nor had he one hope so predominant over all others that his life was one of masked suspense as was the case with poor madge | he was rather like the rugged sun lighted mountains near solid stable simple | no matter what happened he would remain and appear much the same | such was the tenor of madge's thoughts as she waited for the opening of service | fanciful and imaginative to a great degree she found a certain mental enjoyment in observing the impressions made upon her by strangers | the service was brief and simple the good old clergyman preached the gospel of hope and his words calmed and strengthened the young girl's mind | she was made to feel that there is something more and better than present happiness that there are remedies for earthly ills | when she returned to the hotel she found that mrs muir was worried about jack who was worse and that a dr sommers had been sent for | she could not help smiling when a little later the hospitable usher of the chapel came briskly in | she eventually learned that the doctor provoked smiles wherever he went as a breeze raises ripples on the surface of a stream | he smiled himself when he met people and every one took the contagion | he examined the baby said the case would require a little watching until certain teeth came through and then that there would be no further trouble | he spoke with the same confidence with which he would announce that july was near |  you watch the case then said mr muir decisively |  i must be in town | if you can look after the child and save my wife from worry my mind will be easy as regards this end of the line at least |  all right sir | we'll manage it | healthy boy | no trouble |  have you lived long among the mountains doctor | madge ventured to ask |  i should think so | as long as i have lived | was born and brought up among 'em |  it must be dreary here in the winter mrs muir remarked |  not a bit of it | it's never dreary |  how far among the hills does your practice extend | madge pursued |  as far as i'll go and i'm usually going |  perhaps you can give us then some advice as to drives and walks |  oh lots free gratis | i can tell mr muir of a trout stream or two also |  doctor said madge laughing i am very ill | i shall need much advice and prescriptions of all the romantic walks and drives in the vicinity |  and like most of the advice from doctors it won't be taken | a stroll on the piaza is about all that most ladies are equal to | you look however as if you should not fear a steep path or a rough road |  you shall see cried madge |  yes i will see said the doctor laughing and bowing himself out |  i've seen a great many ladies who could dance miles but were as afraid of a mountain as of a bear | at the dinner table mrs muir said laughingly in dr sommers madge has found a kindred spirit another oiler of machinery | if between him and madge things don't go smoothly the fates are indeed against us |  when life does go smoothly it is because of just such good cheery common sense mr muir remarked sententiously |  i'm in the financial centre of this part of the world and schemes involving millions and the welfare of states indeed of whole sections of the country are daily brought to my consideration and i tell you again men are often in no condition to act wisely or well because the wear and tear of their life is greater after business hours than during them | business maniac as madge thinks me to be little jack is of more consequence than a transcontinental railway | i must face the music the discord rather of wall street to morrow | there is no use in protesting or coaxing i must be there but it's a great thing to be able to return with my nerves soothed rested and quieted | heaven help the men who after the strain of the day must go home to be pricked half to death with pin and needle like worries if not worse |  please imagine madge and myself making a profound courtesy for the implied compliment said mrs muir |  but can you not spend part of the week with us | no  graydon will soon be here and there is much to be seen to | he writes that he has worked very hard to get things in shape so that he can leave them and that he wishes to take a vacation | as far as possible i shall gratify him | he can be with you here and come to town occasionally as i need him | it's all turning out very well and i am better off than many in these troublous times | the remainder of his stay passed quietly in absolute rest and on the following morning he was evidently strengthened for the renewal of the struggle | stella  miss wildmere remained absorbed in her novel | stella  repeated mr wildmere impatiently |  what is it | she asked fretfully |  i'm in an exciting scene | can't you wait awhile |  oh throw down your confounded novel | you should be giving your mind to real life and exciting scenes of your own | no i can't wait and don't propose to for i must go out | the words were spoken in a small but elegant house furnished in an ultra fashionable style | mr wildmere was a stout florid man who looked as if he might be burning his candle at both ends | his daughter was dressed to receive summer evening calls at her own home for she was rarely without them | if the door bell had rung she would have dismissed her exciting scene without hesitation but it was only her father who asked her attention |  very well she said absently turning down a leaf | her father observed her listless air and averted face for a moment with contracted brow then quietly remarked graydon muir may return at any time now | her apathy disappeared at once and a faint color stole into her face |  haven't you had enough of general attention and flirtation | i know that my wishes have little weight you have refused not a few good offers and one on which i had set my heart but let the past go | the immediate future may require careful and decisive action | i speak in view of your own interests and to such considerations i know you will not be indifferent | if you were taking a natural and intelligent interest in my affairs you would have some comprehension of my difficulties and dangers | the next few months will decide whether i can keep up or not | in the meantime you have your opportunity | graydon muir will share in the fortunes of his brother who has had the reputation of being very wealthy and eminently conservative | i have learned however that he has invested largely in one enterprise that now appears to be very dubious how largely no one but himself knows | if this affair goes through all right you couldn't do better than develop graydon muir into an impatient suitor and you had better keep him well in hand for a time anyway | he is a good business man and far more to be depended upon than rich young fellows who have inherited wealth with no ability except in spending it | if the muirs pass through these times they will become one of the strongest and safest houses in the country | remember that the if is to be considered | mr arnault too is a member of a strong wealthy house | i would advise you to make your choice between these two men speedily | you are not adapted to a life of poverty and would not enjoy it | an alliance with either of these men might also aid in sustaining me | miss wildmere listened attentively but made no comment and her father evidently did not require any for he went out immediately | he understood his daughter sufficiently to believe that she needed no further advice | he was right | the exciting crisis in her novel was forgotten and her fair face took on an expression that did not enhance its beauty | calculation on the theme uppermost in her mind produced a revery in which an artist would not have cared to paint her | it was evident that the time had come when she must dispose of herself and the question was how to do it to the best advantage | to graydon she gave her preference | he was remarkably fine looking and could easily be a leader in society if he so desired and certainly shall be she thought if i take his name | as far as her heart spoke in the matter it declared for him also | other men had wooed and pleaded but she had ever mentally compared them with graydon and they had appeared insignificant | she had felt sure for a long time that he would eventually be at her feet and she had never decided to refuse him | now she was ready to accept but for this ominous if which her father had emphasized | she could not think of marrying him should he become a poor man | she neither liked nor disliked mr arnault | he was a man of the world reported wealthy established in a large but not very conservative business | he had the name of being a little fast and speculative but she was accustomed to that style of man | he was an open suitor who would take no rebuff and had laughingly told her so | after his refusal instead of going away in despondency or in a half tragic mood he had good naturedly declared his intentions and spent the remainder of the evening in such lively chat that she had been pleased and amused by his tactics | since that time he had made himself useful was always ready to be an escort with a liberal purse and never annoyed her with sentiment | she understood him and he was aware that she did | he took his chances for the future and was always on hand to avail himself of any mood or emergency which he could turn to his advantage | in various unimportant ways he was of service to mr wildmere but hoped more from the broker's embarrassments than from the girl's heart |  i might do worse muttered the beauty i might do worse | if it were not for graydon muir i'd decide the question at once | the door bell rang and graydon was announced | even her experienced nerves had a glad tingle of excitement she was so genuinely pleased to see him | and well she might be for he was a man to light any woman's eyes with admiration | if something of his youth had passed his face had gained a rich compensation in the strong lines of manhood and his manner a courtly dignity from long contact with the best elements of life | one saw that he knew the world but had not been spoiled by it | that he had not become cynical was proved by his greeting of miss wildmere | he was capable of hoping that her continued freedom in spite of her remarkable beauty might be explained on the ground of a latent regard for him which had kept her ready for his suit after an absence so unexpectedly prolonged | through a friend he had from time to time been informed about her and there was no ring on her hand to forbid his ardent glances | never before had she appeared so alluringly attractive | he was a thorough american and had not been fascinated by foreign types of beauty | in his fair countrywoman he believed that he saw his ideal | her beauty was remarkable for a fullness a perfection of outline combined with a fairness and delicacy which suggested that she was not made of ordinary clay | miss wildmere prided herself upon giving the impression that she was remote from all that was common or homely in life | she cultivated the characteristic of daintiness | in her dress gloves jewelry and complexion she would be immaculate at any cost | graydon's fastidious taste could never find a flaw in her as regarded externals and she knew the immense advantage of pleasing his eye with a delicacy that even approached fragility in its exquisite fairness while at the same time her elastic step in the dance or promenade proved that she had abundance of vitality | nothing could have been more auspicious than his coming to night the very first evening after his arrival | it assured her of the place she still held in his thoughts it gave her the chance to renew in the glad hours of his return the impression she had made and she saw in his admiring eyes how favorable that impression was | she exulted that he found her so well prepared | her clinging summer costume revealed not a little of her beauty and suggested more while she permitted her eyes to give a welcome more cordial even than her words | he talked easily and vivaciously complimented her openly yet with sincerity and rallied her on the wonder of wonders that she was still miss wildmere |  not so great a marvel as that you return a bachelor | why did you not marry a german princess or some reduced english countess |  i was not driven to that necessity since there were american queens at home | i am delighted that you are still in town | what are your plans for the summer |  we have not fully decided as yet |  then go to the catskills | our ladies are there at the under cliff house and i am told that it is a charming place |  i will speak to mamma of it | she must come to some decision soon | papa says that he will be too busy to go out of town much |  why then the catskills is just the place accessible to the city you know | that is the reason we have chosen it | i propose to take something of a vacation but find that i must go back and forth a good deal and so shall escape the bore of a long journey |  you have given two good reasons for our going there | the place cannot be stupid since we may see you occasionally and papa could come oftener |  persuade mrs wildmere into the plan by all means and promise me your first waltz after your arrival and there was eagerness in his tone |  will you also promise me your first |  yes and last also if you wish |  oh no | i do not propose to be selfish miss alden will have her claims |  what sister madge | she must have changed greatly if she will dance at all | she is an invalid you know |  i hear she has returned vastly improved in health indeed that she is quite a beauty |  i hope so he said cordially but fear that rumor has exaggerated | my brother said she was better and added but little more | have you seen her | no  i only heard a short time since that she had returned | madge had not gone into society and had she met miss wildmere face to face she would not have been recognized so greatly was she changed from the pallid troubled girl over whom the beauty had enjoyed her petty triumph but the report of miss alden's attractions had aroused in miss wildmere's mind apprehensions of a possible rival | graydon's manner was completely reassuring | whatever miss alden might have become she evidently had no place in his thoughts beyond that natural to their relations | no closer ties had been formed by correspondence during his long absence | further t te t te was interrupted by the appearance of mr arnault | the young men were courteous and even cordial to each other but before half an hour had passed they recognized that they were rivals | graydon's lips grew firm and his eyes sparkled with the spirit of one who had not the faintest idea of yielding to another | miss wildmere was delighted | the game was in her own hands | she could play these two men off against each other and take her choice | mr arnault was made to feel that he was not de trop and as usual he was nonchalant serene and evidently meant to stay | therefore graydon took his leave and was permitted to carry away the impression that his departure was regretted |  mr arnault said miss wildmere quietly we have decided to spend some time at the under cliff house in the catskills | so you perceive that i shall be deprived of the pleasure of your calls for a while |  not at all | i shall take part of my summering there also | when do you go |  in a few days sometime before the fourth | how fortunately it all happens | she added laughing |  when did you decide on the catskills |  that's immaterial | when did you |  that also is immaterial | perhaps you would like to ask mamma |  i'd rather ask papa both i should say he replied with a significant shrug |  do so by all means | meanwhile i would suggest that a great many people go to the catskills thirty thousand more or less it is said |  i had another question in mind | is graydon muir going there in order to follow the crowd |  if he is going i suppose he will follow his inclinations |  or you |  were that possible i could not prevent it | indeed women rarely resent such things |  no indeed | it is well you do not for you would become the embodiment of resentment | how large is your train now stella |  you can dimmish it by one if you choose she replied smiling archly |  i should be little missed no doubt |  i didn't say that |  i'm more afraid of muir than of all the train together |  that's natural | the train has little chance collectively |  don't pretend to misunderstand me | there was unmistakable meaning in muir's eyes |  i should hope so | he means to help me have a good time | so do you i trust | certainly  you may judge of the future from the past he added significantly as he rose to take his leave |  then the future promises well for me she said giving him her hand cordially for you have been one of the best of friends |  and a good deal more | good night |  mamma said miss wildmere stopping at the nursery on her way to her room we must get ready to go to the catskills at once |  why stella | this is the first i've heard of this plan | your father has said that he doesn't see how we can go out of town at all this summer | nonsense  i'll insure that papa agrees |  i don't see how i can get ready soon | the baby is fretful and i'm all worn out between broken rest and worry | won't you take effie for a little while |  where's the nurse |  she's out | of course she has to have some time to herself |  you just spoil the servants | it's her business to take care of the child | what else is she paid for | why can't one of the other maids take her |  effie is too nervous to go to strangers to night |  oh well give her to me then | the sensitive little organization knew at once that it was in the hands not only of a comparative stranger but also of one whose touch revealed little sympathy and its protest was so great that the tired mother took it again while the beautiful daughter the cynosure of all eyes in public went to her room to finish the exciting scene at her leisure | but the scene had grown unreal | its hero was but a shadow and a distorted one at that | the book fell from her hand she again saw graydon muir coming forward to greet her with an easy grace which no prince in story could surpass and with an expression in his dark blue eyes which no woman fails to understand | it assured her that neither in the old world nor in the new had he seen her equal |  i wish it could be she murmured i hope it can be were it not for that 'if' it should be soon | thus after her own fashion another girl had designs upon graydon | chapter ix the meeting graydon had completed his final transactions abroad with more expedition than he had anticipated and having been favored by a quick passage had arrived several days sooner than he was expected | therefore he decided to accompany his brother to the catskills on saturday spending the intervening time in business and such arrangements as would leave him free to remain in the country for a week or two | the second evening after his arrival again found him in miss wildmere's parlor and before he left he was given to understand that mrs wildmere had decided upon the under cliff house also and that they would depart on saturday |  then you will be compagnon de voyage said graydon with undisguised pleasure | somewhat to mrs wildmere's surprise her husband quietly acquiesced in his daughter's wishes telegraphed for rooms and desired his wife to be ready | she was a quiet meek little woman whose life had somehow become entangled in a sphere which was not in harmony with her nature | her beauty had faded early and she had little force of character with which to maintain her influence over her husband | his life was amid the fierce excitements of wall street hers as far as she had a life was a weary effort to keep up appearances and meet the expenses of a fashionable daughter on an uncertain and greatly fluctuating income | mr wildmere informed her that his affairs would keep him in town until late in the following week but that as the house to which she was going was a quiet family hotel she would have no trouble | mr muir had telegraphed the arrival of his brother and the latter had written a few cordial but hasty lines to both his sister in law and madge | where he spent his evenings was unknown to mr muir but that gentleman had little trouble in guessing when he saw his brother greet the wildmeres as if he understood their plans and laughingly promise mr wildmere that he would see the ladies and their belongings safely established in the under cliff house | graydon observed the slight cloud on his brother's face but ignored it feeling that his preference was an affair of his own | he believed that the long wished for opportunity to press his suit with vigor had come and had no hesitation as to his purpose | he did not intend to act precipitately however | he would first learn just how mr arnault stood and become reasonably assured by miss wildmere's manner toward himself that her preference was not a hope but a reality | the enterprise in which mr muir had engaged and which now so taxed his financial strength was outside of his regular business and graydon knew nothing of it | the young man believed that his own means and exceptionally good prospects were sufficient to warrant the step he proposed to take | he assuredly had the right to please himself in his choice and he felt that he would be fortunate indeed could he win one whom so many had sought in vain | it never entered mr muir's mind to interpose any authority or undue influence | he merely felt in regard to the matter a repugnance natural to one so alien in disposition to mr wildmere and his daughter and it was a source of bitter mortification to him that he now found himself in a position not unlike that of the broker in what would appear in the present aspect of affairs to be an outside speculation | during the ride to the mountains he mentally compared miss wildmere's behavior with that of madge a week before | witnessing graydon's evident infatuation he would have been glad to recognize any manifestation of traits that promised well for his future but the young lady was evidently altogether occupied with the attentions she received her own beauty and the furtive admiration of fellow passengers | poor mrs wildmere and the nurse were left to manage the cross baby as best they could | graydon once or twice tried to do something but his strange face and voice only frightened the child | to madge it had seemed an age since the telegram announcing graydon's arrival had thrilled every nerve with hope and fear | then had come his hasty note proving conclusively his affectionate indifference | she was simply madge to him as of old | he was the one man of all the world to her and no calculating if would be the source of her restraint | true to her old tactics however she had spent no time in idle dreaming | she had cultivated dr sommers's acquaintance and he had already accompanied her and her sister through a wild valley on the occasion of a visit to one of his patients | little jack had improved under his care and mrs muir was growing serene rested and eager for saturday | madge shared her impatience and yet dreaded the hour during which she felt that a glimpse of the future would be revealed | she had driven out daily with her sister and familiarized herself with the topography of the region | having formed the acquaintance of some pleasant and comparatively active people in the house she had joined such walking expeditions as they would venture upon | in rowing the children upon a small lake she also disposed of some of her superabundant vitality and the nervous excitement which anticipation could not fail to produce | in the evening there was more or less dancing and her hand was eagerly sought by such of the young men as could obtain the right to ask it | mrs muir's remark that she would become a belle in spite of herself proved true but while she affected no exclusive or distant airs the most callow and forward youth felt at once the restraint of her fine reserve | her sensitive nature enabled her in a place of public resort to know instinctively whom to keep at a distance and who like dr sommers not only invited but justified a frank and friendly manner | as the time for the gentlemen to arrive approached mrs muir showed more restless interest than madge | the one anticipated a bit of amusement over graydon's surprise the other looked forward to meeting her fate | mrs muir was garrulous madge was comparatively silent and maintained the semblance of interest in a book so naturally that her sister exclaimed i expect you will die with a book in your hand | i could no more read now than preach a sermon | come it's time to make your toilet | let me help you and i want you to get yourself up 'perfectly regardless '| you must outshine them all at the hop this evening |  nonsense mary | they won't be here for an hour and a half | i'm going to lie down and she went to her room | when her sister sought admittance half an hour later the door was locked and all was quiet | at last in her impatience she knocked and cried wake up | they will be here soon |  i'm not asleep and it will not take me long to dress |  well you are the coolest young woman i ever knew mrs muir called out finding that admittance was denied her | madge had determined to spend the final hour of her long separation alone | her nature had become too deep and strong to seek trivial diversion from the suspense that weighed upon her spirit | as she thought of the possibility of failure and its results her courage faltered a little and a few tears would come | at last with a glance heavenward which proved that there was nothing in her heart to keep her from looking thither for sanction she left her room serene and resolute | she had taken her woman's destiny into her own hand to mold it in her own way but in no arrogant and unbelieving spirit | mrs muir uttered a disappointed protest |  oh madge how plainly you are dressed |  i knew you wouldn't like it at first was the quiet reply | by the time they had reached the parlor door opposite the office near which they proposed to wait for the travellers now momentarily expected mrs muir was compelled to acknowledge the correctness of madge's taste | her costume no more distracted attention from herself than would the infolding calyx of a rosebud | in its exquisite proportions her fine figure was outlined by close white drapery which made her appear taller than she really was | a single half open jacqueminot rose like the one she had sent to graydon at their parting over two years since was fastened on her bosom | her dark eyes burned with a suppressed excitement | her complexion if not so white as that of miss wildmere was pure and had a richer hue of health | but she was pale now | her red lips half destroyed their exquisite curves in firm compression | the moment had not quite come for action when those lips must be true to herself true to her purpose even while they spoke words which might be misleading to others | mrs muir with triumph saw the glances of strong admiration turned toward her sister from every side | madge saw them also but only to read in them the verdict she hoped to obtain from the kind blue eyes for whose coming she waited | standing with mrs muir facing the long hall down which graydon must advance she knew she would see him before he could recognize her | how much of longing of breathless interest would be concentrated in those moments of waiting she herself had never imagined till they were passing | the stages began to arrive with consequent bustle and the hasty advance toward the office of men seeking to register their names early in order to secure a choice of rooms | at last she saw graydon's tall form and laughing face and for a second something approaching to faintness caused her to close her eyes | when she opened them again they rested upon miss wildmere | this young lady understood the art of making an impressive and almost triumphal entry on new scenes | therefore she had been in no haste | indeed haste had no place among her attributes: it was ungraceful and usually not effective | when therefore the crowd had passed on and there was a comparatively clear space in the hall she advanced down it at graydon's side as if her mind was wholly engrossed with their lively chat | never for a second was she unconscious of the attention they attracted | graydon was one at whom even men would turn and look as he passed and she believed that there was none other who could keep step with him like herself | so thought the self appointed committee of reception who always regard curiously the new comers at a summer resort and there were whispered notes of admiration as the two paused for a moment before the register and looked back | then it was seen that a meek looking little lady and a nurse and child were straggling after them while mr muir brought up the rear | graydon had some light wraps thrown gracefully over his arm but the merchant carried the less ornamental impedimenta of the party for the earlier guests had already overladened the office boys | he now handed the valise a sort of tender upon the baby to a porter and rather grimly acknowledged mrs wildmere's mingled thanks and feeble protestations |  please register for us said miss wildmere glancing carelessly yet observantly around | an intervening group had partially hidden madge and her sister | it was also evident that graydon was too much occupied with his fair companion to look far away | he complied thinking meantime some day i may register for her again and then my name will suffice for us both | the smile which followed the thought brought out the best lines of his handsome profile to poor madge who permitted no phase of expression on that face to escape her scrutiny | so true was the clairvoyance of her intense interest that she guessed the thought which was so agreeable to him and she grew paler still | mr muir hastened to greet his wife and then graydon recognized her | he came at once and kissed her in his accustomed hearty way | madge stood near unnoted unrecognized |  where's madge | isn't she well enough to come down | he asked his eyes following miss wildmere who had entered the parlor which she must cross to reach her room beyond | mrs muir began to laugh immoderately and mr muir followed his brother's eyes with vexation | graydon was on the qui vive instantly and madge drew a step nearer and began to smile | for once the punctilious and elegant graydon forgot his courtesy and looked at madge in utter astonishment an expression however which passed swiftly into admiration and delight | madge  he exclaimed seizing both her hands |  i couldn't have believed it | i wouldn't believe it now but for your eyes and before she could prevent him he had placed a kiss upon her lips | miss wildmere had seen the unknown beauty as she passed had inventoried her with woman's instantaneous perception had paused on the distant threshold and seen the greeting then had vanished with a vindictive flash in her gray eyes | graydon's impetuous words and salute had produced smiles and envious glances and the family party withdrew into a retired corner of the apartment madge's cheeks meanwhile vying in spite of herself with the rose on her breast | graydon would not relinquish her hand and as mrs muir had predicted indulged in little more than exclamation points |  there now be rational cried the young girl laughing her heart for the moment full of gladness and triumph | he was indeed bending upon her looks of admiration delight and affection |  why have i been kept in the dark about all this | he at last asked incoherently |  for the same reason that we were | madge meant to give us a surprise and succeeded | i couldn't get over it and they were always laughing at me so i determined that i should have my laugh at you | oh wasn't it rich | to think of the elegant and travelled society man standing there staring with his eyes and mouth wide open |  i don't think it was quite so bad as that but if it was there's good reason for it | tell me madge how this miracle was wrought |  there that's just what i called it cried mrs muir and it's nothing less than one in spite of all that madge and henry can say |  when you are ready for supper i will show you one phase of the miracle said madge laughing with glad music in her voice |  come i'm not an escaped member of a menagerie and there's no occasion for you to stare any longer |  yes come along added mr muir i've had no roast beef to day and a surfeit of sentiment | the young fellow colored slightly but said brusquely: men's tastes change with age | i suppose you did not find a little sentiment amiss once upon a time | well madge you are not a bit of a ghost now yet i fear you are an illusion |  illusions will vanish when you come to help me at supper | we will wait for you on the piazza | as she paced its wide extent her illusions also vanished | graydon had greeted her as a brother and a brother only | when the tumult at her heart subsided this truth stood out most clearly | his kiss still tingled upon her lips | it must be the last unless followed by a kiss of love | their brotherly and sisterly relations must be shattered at once | no such relations existed for her and only as she destroyed such regard on his part could a tenderer affection take its place | with her as his sister he would be content he might not readily think of her in another light and meantime might drift swiftly into an engagement with miss wildmere | chapter x old ties broken madge said graydon rejoining her on the piazza and giving her his arm while mrs muir sat down to wait for her husband you wear a rose like the one you sent me when we parted so long ago | oh but my heart was heavy then | did you make this choice to night by chance |  you have a good memory |  you have not answered me |  i shall admit nothing that will increase your vanity |  you will now of necessity make my pride overweening |  how is that | i hope to have a better influence over you |  as i look at you i regard my pride as most pardonable and natural | my old thoughts and hopes are realized beyond even imagination although looking at your eyes in old times i always had a high ideal of your capabilities | i should be a clod indeed if i were not proud of such a sister to champion in society | madge's hearty laugh was a little forced as she said you have a delightfully cool way of taking things for granted | i'm no longer a little sick girl but to vary peggotty's exultant statement a young lady 'growed '| you forgot yourself sir in your greeting but that was pardonable in your paroxysm of surprise |  what madge | will you not permit me to be your brother |  what an absurd question | she answered still laughing |  you are not my brother | can i permit water to run up hill | you were like a brother though when i was a sick child in the queer old times kinder than most brothers i think | but graydon i am grown up | see my head comes above your shoulder |  well you are changed |  for the better in some respects i hope you will find |  i don't at all like the change you suggest in our relations and am not sure i will submit to it | it seems absurd to me |  it will not seem so when you come to think of it she replied gravely and gently |  you think of me still as little madge i am no longer little madge even to myself | a woman's instincts are usually right graydon |  oh thank you | i am glad i am still 'graydon '| why do you not call me 'mr | muir ' |  because i am perfectly rational | because i regard you as almost the best friend i have |  break up that confabulation cried mr muir to the young people who had paused and were confronting each other at the further end of the piazza |  if you think madge can explain herself in a moment or a week you are mistaken | come to supper |  my brother is right you are indeed an enigma he said discontentedly |  an enigma am i | she responded smiling |  please remember that most of the world's enigmas were slowly found out because so simple | as they passed from the dusky piazza to the large brilliantly lighted supper room with nearly all its tables occupied he was curious to observe how she would meet the many critical eyes turned toward her | again he was puzzled as well as surprised | she walked at his side as though the room were empty | there was no affectation of indifference no trace of embarrassed or of pleased self consciousness | from the friendly glances and smiles that she received it was also apparent that she had already made acquaintances | she moved with the easy graceful step of perfect good breeding and assured confidence and was as self possessed as himself | was this the little ghost who had once been afraid of her own shadow which was scarcely less substantial than herself | they had been seated but a moment when miss wildmere entered alone | to graydon this appeared pathetic | he did not know that her mother was so worn out from the journey and so embarrassed by unaided efforts to get settled while still caring for her half sick child that she had decided to make a slight and hasty repast in her own room | miss wildmere cared little for what took place behind the scenes but was usually superb before the footlights | nothing could have been more charming or better calculated to win general good will than her advance down the long room | in external beauty she was more striking at first than madge | she did not in the least regret that she must enter alone for she was not proud of her mother and nothing drew attention from herself | she assumed however a slight and charming trace of embarrassment and perplexity which to graydon was perfectly irresistible and he mentally resolved that she should not much longer want a devoted escort | madge saw his glance of sympathy and strong admiration his smile and low bow as she passed ushered forward by the obsequious headwaiter and her heart sank | in spite of all she had attempted and achieved the old cynical assurance came back to her you are nothing to graydon and never can be anything to him | she was pale enough now but her eyes burned with the resolution not to yield until all hope was slain | she talked freely and was most friendly toward graydon but there was a slight constraint in his manner | the beautiful and self possessed girl who sat opposite him was not little madge whom it had been his pleasure to pet and humor | she evidently no longer regarded herself as his sister but rather as a charming young woman abundantly able to take care of herself | she had indeed changed marvellously in more respects than one and he felt aggrieved that he had been kept in ignorance of her progress | he believed that she had grown away from him and the past as well as grown up according to her declaration | he recalled her apparent disinclination for correspondence and now thought it due to indifference rather than an indolent shrinking from effort | the surprise she had given him seemed a little thing an act due possibly to vanity compared with the sisterly accounts she might have written of her improvement | she had achieved the wonder without aid from him and so of course had not felt the need of his help in any way | in remembrance of the past he felt that he had not deserved to be so ignored | her profession of friendship was all well enough there could scarcely be less than that but the madge he had looked forward to meeting again as of old no longer existed | oh yes she should have admiration and exclamation points to her heart's content but he had come from his long exile hungry for something more and better than young lady friends | he had long since had a surfeit of these semi platonic affinities | the girl who apparently had been refusing scores of men for his sake was more to his taste | his brother's repugnance only irritated and incited him and he thought i'll carry out his business policy to the utmost but away from the office i am my own man | as these thoughts passed through his mind they began to impart to his manner a tinge of gallantry the beginning of a departure from his old fraternal and affectionate ways | he was too well bred to show pique openly or to reveal a sense of injury during the first hours of reunion but he already felt absolved from being very attentive to a girl who not only had proved so conclusively that she could manage admirably for herself but who also had been so indifferent that she had not needed his sympathy in her efforts or thought it worth while to gladden him with a knowledge of her progress | he had loved her as a sister and had given ample proof of this | he had maintained his affection for the madge that he remembered |  but i have been told he thought bitterly that the young lady before me is a 'friend '| she has been a rather distant friend if the logic of events counts for anything | not satisfied with the thousands of miles that separated us she has also withheld her confidence in regard to changes that would have interested even a casual acquaintance | madge soon detected the changing expression of his eyes the lessening of simple loving truth in his words and while she was pained she feared that all this and more would necessarily result from the breaking up of their old relations | her task was a difficult one at best perhaps it was impossible nor had she set about it in calculating policy | their old relations could not be maintained on her part | even the touch of his hand had the mysterious power to send a thrill to her very heart | therefore she must surround herself at once with the viewless yet impassable barriers which a woman can interpose even by a glance | as they rose graydon remarked i have helped you at supper and yet one of my illusions has not vanished | the air at santa barbara must have been very nourishing if your appetite was no better there than here | your strange 'sea change' on that distant coast is still marvellous to me |  mary can tell you how ravenous i usually am | i do not meet friends every day from whom i have been separated so long |  it is a very ordinary thing for me to meet 'friends ' he replied sotto voce for i have many | i had hopes that i should meet one who would be far more than a friend | i'm half inclined to go out to santa barbara and see if my little sister madge is not still there |  do you think me a fraud |  oh no only so changed that i scarcely know how to get acquainted with you |  even if i granted so much which i do not i might suggest that one must be uninteresting indeed if she inspires no desire for acquaintance | but such talk is absurd between us graydon |  of course it is | you are so changed for the better that i can scarcely believe my eyes or ears and my heart not at all | of course your wishes shall be my law and my wishes will lead me to seek your acquaintance with deep and undisguised interest | you see the trouble with me is that i have not changed and it will require a little time for me to adapt myself to the new order of things | i am now somewhat stunned and paralyzed | in this imbecile state i am both stupid and selfish | i ought to congratulate you and so i do with all the shattered forces of my mind and reason | you have improved amazingly | you are destined to become a belle par excellence and probably are one now i know so little of what has occurred since we parted |  you are changed also graydon | you used to be kind in the old days and she spoke sadly |  in some respects i am changed he said earnestly and my affection for you is of such long standing and so deep that it prompts me to make another protest |  they had strolled out upon the grounds and were now alone |  i have changed in this respect i am no longer so young as i was and am losing my zest for general society | i was weary of residence abroad where i could have scarcely the semblance of a home and while i had many acquaintances and friends i had no kindred | i'm sorry to say that the word 'friend ' in its reference to young ladies does not mean very much to me or rather i have learned from experience just what it does mean | a few years since i was proud of my host of young lady friends and some i thought would continue to be such through life |bah  they are nearly all married or engaged their lives have drifted completely away from mine as it was natural and inevitable that they should | we are good friends still but what does it amount to | i rarely think of them they never of me i imagine | we exert no influence on each other's lives and add nothing to them | i never had a sister but i had learned to love you as if you were one and when i heard that you were to be of our family again the resumption of our old relations was one of my dearest expectations | it hurt me cruelly madge when you laughed at the idea as preposterous and told me that i had forgotten myself when following the most natural impulse of my heart | it seemed to me the result of prudishness rather than womanly delicacy unless you have changed in heart as greatly as in externals | you could be so much to me as a sister | it is a relationship that i have always craved a sister not far removed from me in age and such a tie it appears to me might form the basis of a sympathy and confidence that would be as frank as unselfish and helpful | that is what i looked forward to in you madge | why on earth can it not be | she was painfully embarrassed and was glad that his words were spoken under the cover of night | she trembled for his question probed deep | how could she explain that what was so natural for him was impossible for her | he mistook her hesitation for a sign of acquiescence and continued: wherein have i failed to act like a brother | during the years we were together was i not reasonably kind and considerate | you did not think of yourself then as one of my young lady friends | why should you now | i have not changed and as i have said i have returned hungry for kindred and the quieter pleasures of home | it is time that i was considering the more serious questions of life and of course the supreme question with a man of my years is that of a home of his own | i have never been able to think of such a home and not associate you with it | i can invite my sister to it and make her a part of it but i cannot invite young lady friends | a sister can be such a help to a fellow and it seems to me that i could be of no little aid to you | i know the world and the men you will meet in society | unless you seclude yourself you will be as great a belle as miss wildmere | you also have a fine property of your own | will it be nothing to have a brother at your side to whom you can speak frankly of those who seek your favor | come madge be simple and rational | i have not changed my frank words and pleadings prove that i have not | if we do not go back to the hotel brother and sister it will be because you have changed and he attempted to put his arm around her and draw her to him | she sprang aloof |  well then i have changed she said in a low concentrated voice |  think me a prude if you will | i know i am not | you are unjust to me for you give me in effect no alternative | you say 'think of me as a brother feel and act as if you were my sister ' when i am not your sister | it's like declaring that there is nothing in blood that such relations are questions of choice and will | i said in downright sincerity that i regarded you as almost the best friend i had and i have not so many friends that the word means nothing to me | i do remember all your kindness in the past when have i forgotten it for an hour but that does not change the essential instincts of my womanhood and since we parted i've grown to womanhood | you in one sense have not changed and i still am in your mind the invalid child you used to indulge and fondle | it is not just to me now to ask that i act and feel as if there were a natural tie between us | the fact ever remains that there is not | why should i deceive you by pretending to what is impossible | nature is stronger than even your wishes graydon and cannot be ignored | she spoke hesitatingly feeling her way across most difficult and dangerous ground but her decision was unmistakable and he said quietly i am answered | see we have wandered far from the house | had we not better return | after a few moments of silence she asked are you so rich in friends that you have no place for me |  why certainly madge he replied in cordial offhand tones we are friends | there's nothing else for us to be | i don't pretend to understand your scruples | even if a woman refused to be my wife i should be none the less friendly unless she had trifled with me | to my man's reason a natural tie does not count for so much as the years we spent together | i remember what you were to me then and what i seemed to you | i tried to keep up the old feeling by correspondence | the west is a world of wonders and you have come from it the greatest wonder of all |  i hope i shall not prove to you a monstrosity graydon | i will try not to be one if you will give me a chance |  oh no indeed you promise to be one of the most charming young ladies i ever met |  i don't promise anything of the kind she replied with a laugh that was chiefly the expression of her intense nervous tension | it jarred upon his feelings and confirmed him in the belief that their long separation had broken up their old relations completely and that she in the new career which her beauty opened before her wished for no embarrassing relations of any kind |  well he said with an answering laugh i suppose i must take you for what you are and propose to be that is if i ever find out | in a few moments more after some light badinage he left her with mr and mrs muir on the piazza and went to claim his waltz with miss wildmere | chapter xi i fear i shall fail the band had been discoursing lively strains for some time and miss wildmere had at last dragged her mother down for a chaperon the only available one as yet | the anxious mother was eager to return to her fretting child and her daughter was much inclined to resent graydon's prolonged absence |  if it were politic and i had other acquaintances i would punish him she thought | it was a new experience for her to sit in a corner of the parlor apparently neglected while others were dancing | there were plenty who looked wistfully toward her but there was no one to introduce her and graydon's absence left the ice unbroken | she ignored the inevitable isolation of a new comer however and when he appeared shook her finger at him as she said here i am constancy itself waiting to give you my first dance as i promised |  i shall try to prove worthy he said earnestly |  you must remember in extenuation that i have not seen the ladies of our family for a long time |  you use the plural and are dot at all singular in your prolonged absence with the charming miss alden | you certainly cannot look upon her as an invalid any longer however else you may regard her she added with an arch look |  you shall now have my entire regard as long as you will permit it |  that will depend a little upon yourself | mamma is tired and i'm of no account compared with that infant upstairs therefore i can't keep her as a chaperon this evening and i will go to my room as soon as you are tired of me |  not till then |  not unless i go before |  at some time in the indefinite future mrs wildmere you may hope to see your daughter again | the poor lady smiled encouragingly and gratefully | she would be most happy to have graydon take the brilliant creature for better or worse as soon as possible | she liked him as did all women for she saw that he had a large kindly nature | she now stole meekly away while he with his fair partner glided out upon the floor | all eyes followed them and even the veterans of society remarked that they had never seen more graceful dancing | from her seat on the piazza madge also watched the couple | the struggle to which she had looked forward so long had indeed begun and most inauspiciously | her rival had every advantage | the mood in which graydon had returned predisposed him to prompt action while she had lost her influence for the present by a course that seemed to him so unnatural as to be prudish | miss wildmere's manner gave all the encouragement that a man could wish for and it was hard to view with charity the smiling triumphant belle | madge suddenly became conscious that mr muir was observing her and she remarked quietly: i never saw better dancing than that | it's grace itself | miss wildmere waltzes superbly |  not better than you miss alden said mr henderson a young man who prided himself on his skill in the accomplishment under consideration and with whom she had danced several times |  i've been looking for you in the hope that you would favor me this evening | she rose and passed with him through the open window | the waltz was drawing to a close the majority had grown weary and sat down and soon madge and miss wildmere were the only ladies on the floor | opinion was divided some declaring that the former was the more graceful and lovely while perhaps a larger number gave their verdict for the latter | the strains ceased and left the couples near each other | graydon immediately introduced miss wildmere | the girls bowed a little too profoundly to indicate cordiality | madge also presented mr henderson hoping that he might become a partner for miss wildmere and give graydon an opportunity to dance with her | he resolved to break the ice at once so far as his relatives were concerned and he conducted miss wildmere to mrs muir and gave her a seat beside that lady | the girl of his choice should have not only a gallant for the evening but also a chaperon | he was not one to enter on timid half way measures and he determined that his brother's prejudice should count for nothing in this case | his preference was entitled to respect and must be respected | of course the group chatted courteously as well bred people do in public but miss wildmere felt that the atmosphere was chilly | she was much too politic to permit the slightest tinge of coldness in her manner toward those with whom she meditated such close relations should the barring if melt out of the way | the people were forming for the lancers and mr henderson asked madge to help make up a set | she complied without hesitation | nor was she unmindful of the fact that graydon sat in a position which commanded a view of the floor | he had seen her glide out in the waltz with a grace second only to that of miss wildmere even in his prejudiced eyes | now he again observed her curiously and his disappointment and bitterness at heart increased even while she compelled his wondering admiration | he saw that though she lacked miss wildmere's conventional finish she had a natural grace of her own | he admitted that he had never seen so perfect a physical embodiment of womanhood | she was slightly taller than her rival in his thoughts and her costume gave an impression of additional height | apparently she was in the best of spirits laughing often with her partner and an elderly gentleman who danced opposite to her and who was full of old time flourishes and jollity | at last graydon thought resentfully she is indeed changed | that's the style of life she is looking forward to and she wishes no embarrassment or advice from me | that dancing jack henderson and others of his sort are to be her 'friends' also no doubt | very well i know how to console myself and he turned his eyes resolutely to miss wildmere | in the galop that followed he naturally danced with his quondam sister and mr henderson with miss wildmere | graydon was the last one to show feeling in public or do anything to cause remark | now that madge possessed in her partner the same advantage that miss wildmere had enjoyed the admiring lookers on were at a loss to decide which of the two girls bore the palm and graydon acknowledged that the former invalid's step had a lightness and an elasticity which he had never known to be surpassed and that she kept time with him as if his volition were hers | she showed no sign of weariness even after he began to grow fatigued | as he danced he remembered how he had carried the little ghost on his arm then tossed her breathless from scarce an effort on the lounge whence she looked at him in laughing affection | this strong superb creature was indeed another and an alien being and needed no aid from him | before he was conscious of flagging in his step she said quietly you are growing tired graydon | suppose we return to the piazza |  yes he said a trifle bitterly you are the stronger now | the 'little ghost' has vanished utterly |  a woman is better than a ghost was her reply | he and miss wildmere strolled away down the same path on which madge had told him that she could not be his sister | mr muir was tired and went to his room in no very amiable humor | mrs muir waited for graydon's return feeling that although the office of chaperon had in a sense been forced upon her she could not depart without seeing miss wildmere again | the young lady at last appeared and believing that she had made all the points she cared for that night did not tax mrs muir's patience beyond a few moments | while she lingered she looked curiously at madge who was going through a virginia reel as if she fully shared in the decided and almost romping spirit with which it was danced | she was uncertain whether or not she saw a possible rival in graydon's thoughts but she knew well that she had found a competitor for sovereignty in all social circles where they might appear together | this fact in itself was sufficient to secure the arrogant girl's ill will and jealousy | a scarcely perceptible smile that boded no good for poor madge passed over her face and then she took a cordial leave of graydon and retired with mrs muir | he remained at the window watching with a satirical smile the scene within | people of almost every age from elderly men and matrons down to boys and girls were participating in the old fashioned dance | the air was resonant with laughter and music | in the rollicking fun madge appeared to have found her element | no step was lighter or quicker than hers and merriment rippled away before her as if she were the genius of mirth | her dark eyes were singularly brilliant and burned as with a suppressed excitement |  she is bound to have her fling like the rest i suppose he muttered and that romp is more to her than the offer of a brother's love and help an offer half forgotten already no doubt | yet she puzzles one | she never was a weak girl mentally | she was always a little odd and now she is decidedly so | well i will let her gang her ain gate and i shall go mine | he little dreamed that she was seeking weariness action that would exhaust and that the expression of her eyes so far from being caused by excitement was produced by feelings deeper than he had ever known | when the music ceased he sauntered up and told her that her sister had retired |  i had better follow her example she said |  would you not like a brief stroll on the piazza | after exertions that in you seem almost superhuman you must be warm |  why more superhuman in me than in others |  simply because of my old and preconceived notions |  i fear i am disappointing you in every respect | i had hoped to give you pleasure |  oh well madge i see we must let the past go and begin again |  begin fairly then and not in prejudice |  does it matter very much to you how i begin |  i shall not answer such questions |  i am glad to see that you can enjoy yourself so thoroughly | you can now look forward to a long career of happiness madge since you can obtain so much from a reel |  you do not know what i am looking forward to | why   because you are not acquainted with me |  i thought i was at one time |  i became discontented with that time and have tried to be different |  and you must have succeeded beyond your wildest dreams |  oh no i've only made a beginning | i should be conceit embodied if i thought myself finished |  what is your supreme ambition then |  i am trying to be a woman graydon | there i'm cool now | good night |  very cool madge | he lighted a cigar and continued his walk more perturbed than he cared to admit even to himself | indeed he found that he was decidedly annoyed and there seemed no earthly reason why there should have been any occasion for such vexation | of course he was glad that madge had become strong and beautiful | this would have added a complete charm to their old relations | why must she also become a mystery or rather seek to appear one | well there was no necessity for solving the mystery granting its existence |  possibly she would prefer a flirtation to fraternal regard possibly oh confound it | i don't know what to think and don't much care | she is trying to become a woman | who can fathom some women's whims and fancies | she thinks her immature ideas imbibed in an out of the way corner of the world the immutable laws of nature | of one thing at least she is absolutely certain she can get on without me | i must be kept at too great a distance to be officious | this point settled his own course became clear | he would be courtesy itself and mind his own business |  i fear i shall fail murmured poor madge hiding her face in her pillow while suppressed sobs shook her frame | chapter xii the promptings of miss wildmere's heart graydon slept very late the following morning | he found out that he was tired and resolved to indulge his craving for rest so far as his suit to miss wildmere would permit | when he could do nothing to promote his advantage he proposed to be indolence itself | he found that his vexation had quite vanished and in cynical good nature he was inclined to laugh at the state of affairs |  let madge indulge her whims he thought i may be the more free to pursue my purposes | her sister of course shares in henry's prejudices against the wildmeres and they would influence madge adversely | all handsome girls are jealous of each other and perhaps if what i had so naturally hoped and expected had proved true i should have had more sisterly counsel and opposition than would have been agreeable | objections now would be in poor taste to say the least | if i'm not much mistaken i can speak my mind to stella wildmere before many days pass and woman nature being such as it is it may be just as well that i am not too intimate with a sister who after all is not my sister | stella might not see it in the light that i should and so he came down at last prepared to adapt himself very philosophically to the new order of things |  the world moves and changes he soliloquized smilingly and we must move on and change with it | he found mr and mrs muir with madge and the children ready for church and told them laughingly to remember him if they did not think him past praying for | during his breakfast he recalled the fact that madge was uncommonly well dressed |  she hasn't in externals he thought the provincial air that one might expect although her ideas are not only provincial but prim obtained no doubt from some goody good books that she has read in the remote region wherein she has developed so remarkably | she has some stilted ideal of womanhood which she is seeking to attain and the more unnatural the ideal the more attractive no doubt it appears to her | it did not occur to him that he was explaining madge on more theories than one and that they were not exactly harmonious | having finished his meal he sought for miss wildmere and soon found her in a shady corner reading a light semi philosophical work thus distinguishing and honoring the day in her choice of literature | he proposed to read to her but the book was soon forgotten in animated talk on his part | she could skilfully play the r le of a good listener when she chose and could therefore be a delightful companion | her color came and went under words and compliments that at times were rather ardent and pronounced | he soon observed however that she led the way promptly from delicate ground | this might result from maidenly reserve or from the fact that she was not quite ready for decisive words | he still believed that he had all needed encouragement that the expression of her eyes often answered his and he knew well what his meant | when in response to his invitation she promised to drive with him in the afternoon all seemed to be going as he wished | graydon felt that during dinner and thereafter for a time he should be devoted to his party to preclude criticism on his course in the late afternoon and in the evening when he proposed to seek society which promised more than theirs | he began to discover that except as her intelligence was larger in one respect madge had not changed from her old self | she responded appreciatively to his thought and fancy and gave him back in kind with interest | she began to question him about a place in europe with which he was familiar and showed such unusual knowledge of the locality that he asked you haven't slipped over there unknown to me i trust |  you might think of an easier explanation than that | you kindly sent me books some of which were rather realistic |  did you read them all | certainly  it would have been a poor return if i had not |  what an inordinate sense of duty you must have had |  i did not read them from a sense of duty | you have perhaps forgotten that i am fond of books |  not all of the books were novels |  many that were not proved the most interesting |  oh indeed another evidence of change he said laughing |  and of sense too i think | mr wayland who is a student had a splendid library and he gave me some ideas as to reading |  can you part with any of them |  that depends she replied with a manner as brusque as his own |  on what |  the inducements and natural opportunities | i'm not going to recite a lesson like a schoolgirl |  one would think you had been to school |  i have where much is taught and learned thoroughly |  now that is enigmatical again |  the best of the books you sent me left some room for the imagination |  ha ha ha madge | you are scoring points right along | i told you graydon that you couldn't understand her in a moment or in a week |  i never regarded your imagination as rampant henry | have you fathomed all her mystery |  far from it nor do i expect to and yet you will grant to me some degree of penetration |  well to think that i should have come home to find a sphinx instead of little madge |  thank you | a sphinx is usually portrayed with at least the head of a woman |  in this case she has one that would inspire a greek sculptor | perhaps in time i may discover a heart also |  that's doubtful | indeed   yes indeed |  what far fetched nonsense | said mrs muir sententiously |  madge has come back one of the best and most sensible girls in the world | men and poets are always imagining that women are mysteries | the fact is they are as transparent as glass when they know their own minds when they don't who else should know them |  who indeed | said graydon laughing |  your saving clause mary is as boundless as space |  how absurd | i understand madge perfectly and so does henry |  you said last evening that the change in her was a miracle | once in the realm of the supernatural what may not one expect |  you knew what i meant | i referred to madge's health and appearance and accomplishments and all that | she has not changed in heart and feeling any more than i have and i'm sure i'm not a sphinx |  no mary you are a sensible and excellent wife and my very dear sister | you suggest no mystery | madge certainly does for you have in addition to all the rest announced an indefinite list of accomplishments |  if i remain the subject of conversation i shall complain that your remarks are personal said madge her brows contracting with a little vexation |  that is what makes our talk so interesting | personals are always read first | in drawing mary and henry out i am getting acquainted with you |  it's not a good way | you like it merely because it teases me and saves trouble | if you must gossip and surmise about me wait till i'm absent |  there madge you know i'm nine tenths in fun said he laughing |  that leaves a small margin for kindly interest in an old acquaintance was her reply as they rose from the table and he saw that her feelings were hurt |  confound it | he thought with irritation it's all so uncalled for and unnatural | nothing is as it used to be | well then i'll talk about books and matters as impersonal as if we were disembodied spirits | they had scarcely seated themselves on the piazza before miss wildmere came forward and introduced her mother | the young lady was determined to prepare the way for a family party | graydon had a confident opulent air which led to the belief that her father's fears were groundless and that before many weeks should elapse the muirs would have to acknowledge her openly | it would save embarrassment if this came about naturally and gradually and she believed that she could be so charming as to make them covet the alliance | miss alden might not like it and the more she disliked it the better | mrs muir's thoughts were somewhat akin |  if graydon will marry this girl it's wise that we should begin on good terms | this is a matter that henry can't control and there's no use in our yielding to prejudice | therefore she was talkative courteous and rapidly softened toward the people whom her husband found so distasteful | graydon employed all his skill and tact to make the conversation general and agreeable but the cloud did not wholly pass from madge's brow | from the moment of her first cold curious stare years since miss wildmere had antagonized every fibre of the young girl's soul and body and she had resolved never to be more than polite to her | she did not look forward to future relationship as was the case with mrs muir but rather to entire separation should graydon become miss wildmere's accepted suitor | now with the instinct of self defence she was more cordial to her rival than to graydon until at the solicitation of the children she stole away | mr muir remarked that he was going to take a nap and soon followed her | their departure was a relief to graydon for it rendered the carrying out of his plan less embarrassing | in his eagerness to be alone with the object of his hopes he soon obtained a carriage and with miss wildmere drove away | mrs muir and mrs wildmere compared maternal and domestic notes sometime longer and then the former went to her room quite reconciled to what now appeared inevitable |  i think you are prejudiced henry she remarked to her husband who was tossing restlessly on the bed |  least said soonest mended was his only response and then he changed the subject | graydon came back with the hope nay almost the certainty of happiness glowing in his eyes | he had spoken confidently of his business plans and prospects and had touched upon the weariness of his exile and his longing for more satisfactory pleasures than those of general society | his companion had listened with an attention and interest that promised more than sympathy | the wild rugged scenes through which they had passed had made her delicate beauty more exquisite from contrast | it was as if a rare tropical bird had followed the wake of summer and graced for a time a region from which it must fly with the first breath of autumn | in distinction from all they saw and met she appeared so fragile such a charming exotic that he felt an overpowering impulse to cherish and shelter her from every rude thing in the world | with a nice blending of reserve and complaisance she appeared to yield to his mood and yet to withhold herself | to a man of graydon's poise and knowledge of society such skilful tactics served their purpose perfectly | they gave her an additional charm in his eyes and furnished another proof of the fineness of her nature | she could not only feel but manifest the nicest shades of preference | if not fully satisfied as to her own heart what could be more refined and graceful than the slight restraint she imposed upon him | and how fine the compliment she paid him in acting on the belief that he was too well bred and self controlled to precipitate matters |  she has the tact and intuition to see he thought that she can show me all the regard she feels and yet incur no danger of premature and incoherent words | she will one day yield with all the quiet grace that she shows when rising to accept my invitation to waltz | therefore as he approached the hotel he was complacency itself until he saw mr arnault on the piazza and then his face darkened with the heaviest of frowns |  why what is the matter | miss wildmere asked |  i had hoped that this perfect afternoon might be followed by a more delightful evening but from the manner in which that gentleman is approaching you it is evident that he expects to claim you |  claim me | i do not think any one has that right just yet | mr arnault certainly has not |  then i may still hope for your society this evening |  have i not permitted you to be with me nearly all day | you must be more reasonable | good evening mr arnault | did you drop from the clouds |  there are none and were there i should forget them in this pleasure | mr muir i congratulate you | we have both been on the road this afternoon but you have had the advantage of me |  and mean to keep it confound you | thought graydon |  ah good evening mr arnault | you are right i have found rough roads preferable to smooth rails and a palace car |  how well you are looking miss stella | but that's chronic with you | this is perfectly heavenly looking directly into her eyes after the heat of the city and my dusty journey |  you are a fine one to talk about things heavenly after fracturing the sabbath day | what would have happened to you in connecticut a hundred years ago |  i should have been ridden on one rail instead of two probably | i'm more concerned about what will happen to me to day and that depends not on blue laws but blue blood | i saw your father this morning and he intrusted me with a letter for you | mr arnault manifested not a particle of jealousy or apprehension and graydon felt himself shouldered out of the way by a courtesy to which he could take no exception | he saw that only miss wildmere herself could check his rival's resolute and easy assurance | this he now felt sure she would do if it passed a certain point and he went to his room annoyed merely and without solicitude |  she must let the fellow down easily i suppose he thought and after to day i need have few fears | if she had wanted him she could have taken him long ago | miss wildmere also went to her room and read her father's letter | it contained these few and significant words: in speaking of possible relations with mr m i emphasized a small but important word 'if '| i now commend it to you still more emphatically | you know i prefer mr m therefore you will do well to heed my caution | mr m may lose everything within a brief time | miss wildmere frowned and bit her lip with vexation | then her white face took on hard resolute lines |  i came near making a fool of myself this afternoon she muttered |  i was more than once tempted to let graydon speak |heavens  i'd like to be engaged to him for awhile | mr arnault plays a bold steady hand but he's the kind of man that might throw up the game if one put tricks on him | my original policy is the best | i must pit one against the other in a fair and open suit till i can take my choice | now that it is clear that graydon cares little for that hideous thing he calls his sister my plan is safe |  what a lovely color you have madge | graydon remarked as they met at supper |  you are unequalled in your choice of cosmetics |  not to be surpassed at any rate |  where did you get it |  up at grand view |  what have you climbed that mountain |  it's not much of a mountain |  it's a tremendous mountain cried little harry |  aunt madge's been teaching us to climb and she lifted us up and down the steep places as if we were feathers and she told us stories about the squirrels and birds we saw up there | oh didn't we have a lovely time jennie |  now i understand said graydon |  the glow in your face comes from the consciousness of good deeds |  it comes from exertion | are you not making too much effort to be satirical |  therefore my face should be suffused with the hue of shame | you see i have changed also and have become a cynic and a heathen from long residence in europe |  please be a noble savage then |  that's not the style of heathen they develop abroad |  madge told us about the savages that used to live in these mountains and how bad they were treated piped jennie |  poor lo | no wonder he went to the bad said graydon significantly |  he was never recognized as a man and a brother |  and he was unsurpassed in retaliation madge added |  considering his total depravity and general innocence that was to be expected |  it turned out to be bad policy |  in so far as he was a man he hadn't any policy |  i shall not depreciate the indians for the sake of argument | they rarely followed the wrong trail however |  what on earth are you and madge driving at | exclaimed mrs muir |  it matters little at what but madge appears to be the better driver chuckled mr muir |  you have a stanch champion in henry said graydon |  you wouldn't have him take sides against a woman |  oh no but you have become so abundantly able to take care of yourself that he might remain neutral |  when you all begin to talk english again i'll join in and now merely remark that i am grateful to you madge for taking care of the children | jack was good with the nurse too and i've had a splendid nap |  i'm evidently the delinquent laughed graydon and have led the way in a conversation that has been as bad as whispering in company | what will become of me | you are not going to church to night madge |  i did not expect to | if your conscience needs soothing oh no no | my conscience has been seared with a hot iron a cold one i mean | the effects are just the same | at the supper room door they were met by dr sommers with a world of comical trouble in his face and he drew madge aside |  what's a man to do | he began |  here's our choir leader sick and the rest won't chirp without him | i can't sing any more than i can dance | you can sing i mean both for that matter | i'd give the best cast of a fly i ever had to take you out in a reel | well here's the trouble | it's nearly meeting time and what's a meeting without music | you can sing i'm sure you can | i've heard you twice in the chapel | now it isn't imposing on good nature is it to ask you to come over and start the tunes for us to night | come now go with me | it will be a great favor and i'll get even with you before the summer is over | madge hesitated a moment | she had hoped for a chat with graydon that evening which might lead to a better understanding and end their tendency to rather thorny badinage | but she heard him chatting gayly with miss wildmere and mr arnault in the distance therefore she said quietly it is time for me to get even with you first | to refuse would not be nice after the lovely drive you took us the other day |  oh you made that square as you went along | well now this is famous | what a meeting we'll have |  you explain to mrs muir and i'll get my hat |  i'm in luck the doctor began joining the muirs on the piazza |  of course you are | you are always in luck said mrs muir |  oh no oh no | draw it milder than that | i've fished many a bad day | i'm in luck to night | what do you think | you can't guess |  you and madge had your heads together and so something will happen | are you going to capture a mountain |  yes a brace of 'em before long | well as good luck would have it our choir leader is sick | i thought it was bad luck at first and meant to give him an awful dose for being so inopportune | it has turned out famously | 'all things work together for good ' you know | that text required faith once when i had hooked a three pound trout and in my eagerness tumbled in where the fish was | oh here you are miss alden | we'll go right along for it's about time |  but you haven't explained cried mrs muir |  we will when we come back said the doctor |  oh i'm merely going over to the chapel to help the doctor out with the singing said madge carelessly |  good by |  well remarked mr muir sotto voce if i were a young fellow there's a trail i'd follow and not that will o' the wisp yonder |  what did you say henry | asked his wife |  it will be hot in town to morrow mary | it's growing confoundedly hot in wall street |  nothing serious henry |  it's always serious there |  oh well you'll come out all right | it's a way you have | mr muir looked grim and troubled but the piazza was dusky |  she can't help me he thought and if she was worrying she might hinder me | things are no worse and they may soon be better | if i had fifty thousand for a month though the strain would be over | she'd be nagging me to take a lot of her money and i'd see wall street sunk first | well well wildmere and i may land together in the same ditch | for a few moments graydon and mr arnault sat on either side of the broker's daughter each seeking the advantage | the young lady enjoyed the situation immensely and for a time had the art to entertain both | arnault at last boldly and frankly took the initiative saying please take a walk with me miss wildmere | i have come all the way from new york for the pleasure of an evening in your society | you will excuse us mr muir | you have had to day and will have to morrow for i must take an early train | miss wildmere laughed and said: i must go with you surely or you will think you have made a bad 'put' in railroad tickets as well as shares for you are like the rest i suppose and with a smiling glance backward at graydon she disappeared |  you are mistaken he said we foresaw this 'squeeze' in the market and have money to lend if the security is ample | we were never doing better |  poor papa | she sighed his securities are lacking i suppose | he does not write very cheerfully |  his security is the best in the city in my estimation | i'd take this little hand in preference to government bonds |  oh don't lend papa anything on that basis for you would surely manage to claim the collateral or whatever you call it in your wall street jargon |  you are infinitely better off than the majority in these hard times |  how so |  by one word you can make three rich yourself included | your father only needs to be tided over a few months |  come come mr arnault this is sunday and you must not talk business |  my fault leans to virtue's side for once |  i'm not just sure to which side it leans was her laughing reply |  are you going to accept muir |  i'm not going to accept any one at present certainly not mr muir before he asks me |  he will ask you |  has he taken you into his confidence |  oh he's as patent as a country borrower |  mr arnault we must change the subject such questions and remarks are not in good taste to say the least | i appreciate your friendship but it does not give you the right to forget that i am a free girl or to ignore my assurance that i propose to remain free for the present |  that is all the assurance that i require just now he answered |  i have been a frank devoted suitor stella | if you do not act precipitately you will act wisely in the end | i shall not be guilty of the folly of depreciating muir he's a good fellow in his way but you will soon be convinced that you cannot afford to marry him |  i think i can afford not to marry any one until my heart prompts me to the act she replied with well assumed dignity | her swift thought was he also knows that the muirs are embarrassed | how is it that graydon speaks and acts in the assured confidence of continued wealth | is he deceiving me | mr arnault changed the subject and none could do this with more adroitness than he or be a more entertaining gallant if he so chose | at the same time he maintained a subtle observance in spite of his vaunted frankness and he soon believed he had reason to hope that miss wildmere had been influenced by his words | almost imperceptibly she permitted additional favor to come into her manner and when she said good night and good by also in view of his early start for the city it was at the foot of the stairway she casually remarking that she would not come down again |  my brief visit has not been in vain he thought |  i have delayed matters and that now means a great deal | she will marry the survivor of this financial gale and in every man's philosophy the survival of the fittest is always the survival of the ego | chapter xiii you will be disappointed graydon felt that it was scarcely possible to resent mr arnault's tactics or to blame miss wildmere | the former certainly had as good a right to be a suitor as himself and even to his prejudiced mind it would have been ungracious in the lady had she not given some reward for his rival's long journey | it was natural that mr arnault an old friend of the wildmeres should sit at their table and receive the consideration that he enjoyed | graydon had little cause for complaint or vexation since his rival would depart in the morning and judging from to day his own suit was approaching a successful termination | the coast would be clear on the morrow and he determined to make the most of opportunities | he now even regretted that madge and his relatives were at the house for in some degree they trammelled his movements by a watchful attention which he believed was not very friendly | it would not be well to ignore them beyond a certain point for it was his wish to carry out his purposes with the least possible friction | madge's course had compelled a revision of his plans and expectations but his intimate relations with his brother in business made harmony and peace very essential | he felt keenly however the spur of mr arnault's open and aggressive rivalry and determined to enter upon an equally vigorous campaign | having reached this definite conclusion he joined mr and mrs muir on the piazza and after some desultory talk asked where is madge | mrs muir explained adding i think you might go over to the chapel and accompany her home |  i'll be there by the time service is over he replied | there was sacred music in the hotel parlor but it seemed to him neither very sacred nor very attractive |  in the same manner the christian as christian cannot grant the rights of man pp | 19 20 | according to bauer the individual must sacrifice the privilege of faith in order to be able to receive the general rights of man | let us consider for a moment the so called rights of man in fact the rights of man in their authentic shape in the shape which they possess among their discoverers the north americans and the french | in part these rights of man are political rights rights which are only exercised in the community with others | participation in the affairs of the community in fact of the political community forms their substance | they come within the category of political freedom of civil rights which does not as we have seen by any means presuppose the unequivocal and positive abolition of religion and therefore of judaism | it remains to consider the other aspect of human rights the droits de l'homme apart from the droits du citoyen | among them is to be found liberty of conscience the right to practise any cult to one's liking | the privilege of belief is expressly recognized either as a human right or as the consequence of a human right of freedom | declaration of the rights of man and of citizenship 1791 article 10: 7 no penalty should attach to the holding of religious opinions | the right of every man to practise the religious cult to which he is attached is guaranteed by clause 1 of the constitution of 1791 | the declaration of the rights of man etc 1793 includes among human rights article 7: the free practice of cults | with respect to the right to publish ideas and opinions and to assemble for the practice of a cult it is even stated: the necessity for enunciating these rights presupposes either the presence or the recent memory of a despotism | constitution of pennsylvania article 9 paragraph 3: all men have received from nature the imprescriptible right to worship the almighty according to the dictates of their conscience and nobody may legally be constrained to follow to institute or to support against his will any religious cult or ministry | in no case may any human authority interfere in questions of conscience and control the prerogatives of the soul | constitution of new hampshire articles 5 and 6: among the number of natural rights some are inalienable by their nature because nothing can take their place | such are the rights of conscience | the incompatibility of religion with the rights of man is thus not implied by the conception of the rights of man because the right to be religious to be religious according to one's liking to practise the cult of a particular religion is expressly included among the rights of man | the privilege of faith is a general right of man | the rights of man as such are distinguished from the rights of the citizen | what is man apart from the citizen | nothing else than a member of bourgeois society | why is the member of bourgeois society called man and why are his rights called the rights of man | how do we explain this fact | from the relation of the political state to bourgeois society from the meaning of political emancipation | above all we must record the fact that the so called rights of man as distinguished from the rights of the citizen are nothing else than the rights of the member of bourgeois society that is of the egoistic individual of man separated from man and the community | the most radical constitution the constitution of 1793 may be cited: declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen | article 2 | these rights etc |  natural and imprescriptible rights are: equality liberty security property | of what consists liberty | article 6 | liberty is the power which belongs to man to do everything which does not injure the rights of others | freedom is therefore the right to do and perform that which injures none | the limits within which each may move without injuring others are fixed by the law as the boundary between two fields is fixed by the fence | the freedom in question is the freedom of the individual as an isolated atom thrown back upon itself | why according to bauer is the jew incapable of receiving the rights of man | but the right of man to freedom is not based upon the connection of man with man but rather on the separation of man from man | it is the right to this separation the right of the individual limited to himself | the practical application of the right of man to freedom is the right of man to private property | in what consists the right of man to private property | article 16 const | of 1793 : the right to property is the right of every citizen to enjoy and dispose of as he likes his goods his income the fruit of his toil and of his industry | the right of man to private property is therefore the right to enjoy and dispose of his property at his will and pleasure without regard for others and independently of society: the right of self interest | each particular individual freedom exercised in this way forms the basis of bourgeois society | it leaves every man to find in other men not the realization but rather the limits of his freedom | but it proclaims above all the right of man to enjoy and dispose of his property his income and the fruit of his toil and his industry according to his pleasure | there still remain the other rights of man equality and security | equality here in its non political significance is nothing but the equality of the above described liberty viz | : every individual is regarded as a uniform atom resting on its own bottom | article 5 of the constitution of 1793 states: equality consists in the fact that the law is the same for all whether it protects or whether it punishes | and security | article 8 of the constitution of 1793: security consists in the protection accorded by society to each of its members for the preservation of his person his rights and his property | security is the supreme social conception of bourgeois society the conception of the police the idea that society as a whole only exists to guarantee to each of its members the maintenance of his person his rights and his property | by the conception of security bourgeois society does not raise itself above its egoism | security is rather the confirmation of its egoism | none of the so called rights of man therefore goes beyond the egoistic individual beyond the individual as a member of bourgeois society withdrawn into his private interests and separated from the community | far from regarding the individual as a generic being the generic life society itself rather appears as an external frame for the individual as a limitation of his original independence | the sole bond which connects him with his fellows is natural necessity material needs and private interest the preservation of his property and his egoistic person | it is strange that a people who were just beginning to free themselves to break down all the barriers between the various members of the community to establish a political community that such a people should solemnly proclaim the justification of the egoistic individual separated from his fellows and from the community and should even repeat this declaration at a moment when the most heroic sacrifice could alone save the nation and was therefore urgently required at a moment when the sacrifice of all interests of bourgeois society was imperative and egoism should have been punished as a crime | this fact is even stranger when we behold the political liberators degrading citizenship and the political community to the level of a mere means for the maintenance of these so called rights of man proclaiming the citizen to be the servant of the egoistic man degrading the sphere in which the individual behaves as a social being below the sphere in which he behaves as a fractional being and finally accepting as the true proper man not the individual as citizen but the individual as bourgeois |  declaration of the rights etc of 1791 article 2 | the purpose of government is to assure to man the enjoyment of his natural and imprescriptible rights |  declaration of 1793 art |1  thus even at the time when its enthusiasm was still fresh and kept at boiling point by the pressure of circumstances the political life proclaimed itself to be a mere means whose end is the life of bourgeois society | it is true that its revolutionary practice was in flagrant contradiction to its theory | while security for example was proclaimed to be a right of man the violation of the secrecy of correspondence was publicly proposed | while the indefinite liberty of the press 1793 constitution art | 122 was guaranteed as a consequence of the right of man to individual liberty the freedom of the press was completely destroyed for liberty of the press could not be permitted when it compromised public liberty |  robespierre jeune parliamentary history of the french revolution | buchez et roux p |135  this means that the right of man to liberty ceases to be a right as soon as it comes into conflict with the political life whereas according to theory the political life is only the guarantee of the rights of man and should therefore be surrendered as soon as its object contradicts these rights of man | but the practice is only the exception and the theory is the rule | if however we regard the revolutionary practice as the correct position of the relation the riddle still remains to be solved why the relationship was inverted in the consciousness of the political liberators the end appearing as the means and the means as the end | this optical illusion of their consciousness would still be the same riddle although a psychological a theoretical riddle | the riddle admits of easy solution | the political emancipation is at the same time the dissolution of the old society upon which was based the civic society or the rulership alienated from the people | the political revolution is the revolution of bourgeois society | what was the character of the old society | it can be described in one word |feudality  the old civic society had a directly political character that is the elements of civic life as for example property or the family or the mode and kind of labour were raised to the level of elements of the community in the form of landlordism status and corporation | in this form they determined the relation of the individual to the community that is his political relation his relationship of separation and exclusion from the other constituent parts of society | for the latter organization of popular life did not raise property or labour to the level of social elements but rather completed their separation from the political whole and constituted them as special societies within society | thus the vital functions and vital conditions of society continued to be political although political in the sense of feudality which means that they excluded the individual from the political whole and transformed the special relation of his corporation to the political whole into his own general relation to the popular life | as a consequence of this organization the political unity necessarily appears as the consciousness the will and the activity of the political unity and likewise the general state power as the special concern of a ruler and his servants sundered from the people | the political revolution which overthrew this domination and raised political affairs to the rank of popular affairs which constituted the political state as a general concern that is as a real state necessarily shattered all estates corporations guilds privileges which were just so many expressions of the separation of the people from their community | the political revolution thereby abolished the political character of civic society | it dissolved civic society into its elemental parts on the one hand into the individuals on the other hand into the material and spiritual elements which formed the vital content the civic situation of these individuals | it released the political spirit which was imprisoned in fragments in the various blind alleys of the feudal society it collected all these dispersed parts of it liberated it from its entanglement with the civic life and constituted it as the sphere of the community of the general popular concerns in ideal independence from its particular elements of civic life | the specific life activity and the specific life situation settled into a merely general significance | they no longer formed the general relation of the individual to the political whole | the public business as such became rather the general business of every individual and the political function became his general function | but the completion of the idealism of the state was at the same time the completion of the materialism of civic society | the throwing off of the political yoke was at the same time the throwing off of the bond which had curbed the egoistic spirit of civic society | the political emancipation was at the same time the emancipation of civic society from politics from even the semblance of a general content | feudal society was resolved into its basic elements its individual members | but into the individuals who really formed its basis that is the egoistic individual | this individual the member of civic society is now the basis the assumption of the political state | he is recognized as such in the rights of man | the liberty of the egoistic individual and the recognition of this liberty are however tantamount to the recognition of the unbridled movement of the intellectual and material elements which inform him | the individual was therefore not liberated from religion he received religious freedom | he was not freed from property he received freedom of property | he was not freed from the egoism of industry he received industrial freedom | the constitution of the political state and the dissolution of civic society into independent individuals whose relation is right as the relation of the members of estates and of guilds was privilege is accomplished in one and the same act | but the individual as a member of civic society the unpolitical individual necessarily appears as the natural individual | the rights of man appear as natural rights for the self conscious activity concentrates itself upon the political act | the egoistic individual is the sediment of the dissolved society the object of immediate certitude and therefore a natural object | the political revolution dissolves the civic society into its constituent parts without revolutionizing and subjecting to criticism those parts themselves | it regards bourgeois society the world of needs of labour of private interests as the foundation of its existence as an assumption needing no proof and therefore as its natural basis | lastly the individual as a member of bourgeois society counts as the proper individual as the man in contradistinction to the citizen because he is man in his sensual individual closest existence whereas political man is only the abstract artificial individual the individual as an allegorical moral person | the real man is only recognized in the shape of the egoistic individual the true man is only recognized in the shape of the abstract citizen | the abstraction of the political man was very well described by rousseau: he who dares undertake to give instructions to a nation ought to feel himself capable as it were of changing human nature of transforming every individual who in himself is a complete and independent whole into part of a greater whole from which he receives in some manner his life and his being of altering man's constitution in order to strengthen it of substituting a social and moral existence for the independent and physical existence which we have all received from nature | in a word it is necessary to deprive man of his native powers in order to endow him with some which are alien to him and of which he cannot make use without the aid of other people | all emancipation leads back to the human world to relationships to men themselves | political emancipation is the reduction of man on the one side to the member of bourgeois society to the egoistic independent individual on the other side to the citizen to the moral person | not until the real individual man is identical with the citizen and has become a generic being in his empirical life in his individual work in his individual relationships not until man has recognized and organized his own capacities as social capacities and consequently the social force is no longer divided by the political power not until then will human emancipation be achieved |2  the capacity of modern jews and christians to become free by bruno bauer | under this form bauer deals with the relation of the jewish and christian religion as well as with the relation of the same to criticism | its relation to criticism is its relation to the capacity to be free | it follows: the christian has only one stage to surmount viz | : his religion in order to abolish religion generally and therefore to become free |  the jew on the contrary has to break not only with his jewish essence but also with the development of the completion of his religion with a development that has remained alien to him p |71  bauer therefore transforms here the question of jewish emancipation into a purely religious question | the theological scruple as to who stood the most chance of being saved jew or christian is here repeated in the enlightened form: which of the two is most capable of emancipation | it is no longer a question of whether judaism or christianity makes free | but rather on the contrary: which makes more for freedom the negation of judaism or the negation of christianity |  if they wish to be free jews should be converted not to christianity but to christianity in dissolution to religion generally in dissolution that is to enlightenment criticism and its results to free humanity p |70  it appears that jews have still to be converted but to christianity in dissolution instead of to christianity | bauer requires jews to break with the essence of the christian religion a requirement which as he says himself does not arise from the development of jewish essentials | as bauer had interpreted judaism merely as a crude religious criticism of christianity and had therefore read only a religious meaning into it it was to be foreseen that the emancipation of the jews would be transformed into a philosophic theological act | bauer conceives the ideal abstract being of the jew his religion as his whole being | consequently he correctly infers: the jew gives mankind nothing when he despises his narrow law when he abolishes his whole judaism p |65  the relation of jews and christians is therefore as follows: the sole interest of christians in the emancipation of the jews is a general human a theoretical interest | judaism is a detrimental fact in the religious eyes of christians | as soon as their eyes cease to be religious this fact ceases to be detrimental | the emancipation of jews in itself is no work for christians | but in order to emancipate himself the jew has to undertake not only his own work but at the same time the work of the christian the criticism of the synoptics etc | we will try to get rid of the theological conception of the question | the question of the capacity of the jews for emancipation is from our standpoint transformed into the question what particular social element has to be overcome in order to abolish judaism | for the capacity for emancipation of the modern jew is the relation of judaism to the emancipation of the modern world | this relation is necessarily disclosed by the special position of judaism in the modern subjugated world | let us consider the real worldly jews not the sabbath jews as bauer does but the every day jews | we will not look for the secret of the jew in his religion but we will look for the secret of religion in the real jew | what is the secular basis of judaism | practical needs egoism | what is the secular cult of the jew |huckstering  what is his secular god |money  very well | emancipation from huckstering and from money and therefore from practical real judaism would be the self emancipation of our epoch | an organization of society which would abolish the fundamental conditions of huckstering and therefore the possibility of huckstering would render the jew impossible | his religious consciousness would dissolve like a mist in the real vital air of society | on the other hand: if the jew recognizes as valueless this his practical essence and labours for its abolition he would work himself free of his previous development and labour for human emancipation generally turning against the supreme practical expression of human self alienation | we therefore perceive in judaism a general pervading anti social element which has been carried to its highest point by the historical development in which jews in this bad relation have zealously co operated a point at which it must necessarily dissolve itself | the emancipation of the jews in its last significance is the emancipation of mankind from judaism | the jew has already emancipated himself in jewish fashion |  the jew who in vienna for example is only tolerated determines by his financial power the fate of the whole empire | the jew who may be deprived of rights in the smallest german state determines the fate of europe |  while the corporations and guilds excluded the jew the enterprise of industry laughs at the obstinacy of the medieval institution |  bauer the jewish question p |14  this is no isolated fact | the jew has emancipated himself in jewish fashion not only by taking to himself financial power but by virtue of the fact that with and without his co operation money has become a world power and the practical jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of christian nations | the jews have emancipated themselves in so far as christians have become jews |  the pious and politically free inhabitant of new england relates colonel hamilton is a kind of laokoon who does not make even the slightest effort to free himself from the serpents which are throttling him | mammon is his god he prays to him not merely with his lips but with all the force of his body and mind |  in his eyes the world is nothing more than a stock exchange and he is convinced that here below he has no other destiny than to become richer than his neighbours | when he travels he carries his shop or his counter on his back so to speak and talks of nothing but interest and profit | if you could keep me in mind for years i

endowed with enormous selfishness and the bump of appropriation grows almost into a deformity |  i never expect to see deformities of any kind in graydon muir she said laughing |  now that we understand each other so well give me your hand and pull me up this steep place before which we have stood so long while getting over another little steep place that lay in our path | i'm glad the others have all gone on for now you can help me all you choose and i shan't care | he did help her with a touch and freedom that grew into something like caresses | he felt that he had revealed himself almost as completely as if he had spoken his love and that he had received and was receiving more than encouragement | she did not rebuke his manner which was that of a lover | there was no committal in that nothing that could bind her | she permitted the avowal of his hope that he had been in her thoughts during his long absence and the natural inference that her hand was still free because of his hold upon her heart | this belief filled him with gratitude and inspired him as she intended it should with generous thoughts and impulses toward her | what if she did prefer to maintain a little longer the delicate half reserve that precedes a positive engagement | it only insured that the cup of happiness should be sipped and enjoyed more leisurely | she had seen too much of life and enjoyed too many of its pleasures to act with precipitation now | she understood him and yet loved him well enough to be jealous of one whom she believed that he regarded as a sister | with amusement he thought: she is not even that to me now | hanged if i know what she is to me beyond a pretty vexatious puzzle | miss wildmere's strategy had accomplished one thing however | believing that he was absolved by madge's course from everything beyond cordial politeness he had resolved to carry out her rival's wishes | it was no great cross to forego madge's society and if miss wildmere saw that he was not consoling himself during the hours she spent with arnault she would shorten them in his behalf | after reaching a certain point he suggested: instead of scaling that rocky height after the rest of the party suppose we follow this grassy wood road to parts unknown | it will be easier for you than climbing and you are better society than a crowd | she assented smilingly and madge did not see graydon again until they met at dinner | she was pale and looked weary |  oh she thought perhaps my hopes are already vain | they have been alone all the morning | he may have spoken he looks so happy and content that he must have spoken and received the answer he craved | if so i shall soon join the waylands in my native village for i can't keep up much longer without a little hope |  you are tired madge he said not unkindly |  a little she replied carelessly |  a short nap this afternoon will insure my being ready for the hop to night | chapter xv perplexed and beguiled madge was so discouraged that she contented herself with a manner of listless apathy during dinner and then retired to her room | graydon was giving her so little thought that there was slight occasion for disguise and less incentive for effort to interest him |  the struggle promises to be short and decisive she moaned |  perhaps it has been already decided | i had no chance after all | he came here fully committed in his own thoughts to miss wildmere | i have merely lost my old place in his affection and have had and shall have no opportunity to win his love | if this is to be my fate it is well to discover it so speedily and not after weeks of torturing hope and fear | i'll learn the truth with absolute certainty as soon as possible and then find a pretext to join the waylands | at last the fatigue of the morning brought the respite of sleep and when she waked she found late evening shadows in her room and learned that mr muir had arrived it being his purpose to spend the fourth and the remainder of the week with his family | weariness and despondency are near akin and in banishing one madge found herself better able to cope with the other | at any rate she determined to show no weakness | if graydon would never love her he should at least be compelled to respect and admire her and he should never have cause to surmise the heart poverty to which she was doomed | still less would she give her proud rival a chance to wound her again | miss wildmere might make graydon's devotion as ostentatious as she pleased but should never again detect on madge's face a look of pained surprise and solicitude | she made a careful toilet for the evening telling mr muir and her sister not to wait for her as she had overslept herself |  where is madge | graydon asked at the supper table |  she did not wake up in time to come down with us mrs muir replied |  what does it matter | miss wildmere so fills your eyes that you see no one else | when is it to be graydon |  madge evidently sees quite as much of me as she cares to he replied somewhat irritably |  i have not asked when it's to be or whether it's to be at all | i suppose he added satirically that in consideration of my extreme youth i should obtain permission from my family before venturing to ask anything |  that remark is absurd and uncalled for mr muir replied gravely |  of course you will please yourself as i did and we shall make the best of it | but you have no right to expect that we shall see the lady with your eyes | i cannot help seeing her as she is | i do not like her but if you choose to marry her rest assured i shall give neither of you cause for complaint | now according to my custom i've had my say | you could not expect me as your brother to be indifferent still less could i pretend an approval that i don't feel but i recognize that you are as free as i was when mary's suitor and i do not think you can reasonably ask more | our relations are too intimate for misunderstanding | you know that in my present plans and hopes i looked forward to receiving you as a partner at no distant time if such purposes are carried out our interests must always be identical |  pardon me henry said graydon warmly and do not misunderstand my hasty words | i know you have my best welfare at heart you have ever proved that but you misjudge my choice | even mary begins to see that you do and woman's insight is keener than man's | you attribute to the daughter the qualities you dislike in the father | is it nothing that she has waited for me during my long absence when she could pick and choose from so many |  i'm not sure she has been waiting for you her manner toward mr arnault yonder suggests that she may still pick and choose | bah  i'm not afraid of him | she could have taken him long since had she so wished | others who had seats at the table now approached and prevented further interchange of words on so delicate a subject | nevertheless mr muir's arrow had not flown wide of the mark and graydon thought that miss wildmere was unnecessarily cordial toward his rival and that mr wildmere who had also come from the city was decidedly complacent over the fact | graydon's furtive observation was now cut short by the entrance of madge and even he was dazzled by a beauty that attracted many eyes | it was not merely a lovely woman who was advancing toward him but a woman whose nature was profoundly excited | what though she moved in quiet well bred grace and greeted mr muir with natural cordiality | the aroused spiritual element was not wanting in the expression of her face or in the dignity of her carriage | her deep suppressed feeling which bordered on despair her womanly pride which would disguise all suffering at every cost gave to her presence a subtle power felt none the less because intangible | it was evident that she neither saw nor cared for the strangers who were looking their curiosity and admiration and graydon understood her barely well enough to think something whatever it may be makes her unlike other girls | she was languidly indifferent at dinner now she is superbly indifferent | this morning and yesterday she was a gay young girl eager for a mountain scramble or a frolic of any kind | how many more phases will she exhibit before the week is over | poor madge could not have answered that question herself | she was under the control of one of the chief inspirations of feeling and action | moods of which she had never dreamed would become inevitable thoughts which nothing external could suggest would arise in her own heart and determine her manner | in ceasing to hope one also ceases to fear and graydon admitted to himself that he had never before felt the change in madge so deeply | the weak timid little girl he had once known now looked as if she could quietly face anything | the crowded room the stare of strangers were simply as if they were not the approach of a thunder gust in the sultry evening was unheeded when a loud peal drowned her voice she simply waited till she could be heard again and then went on without a tremor in her tones while all around her people were nervous starting and exclaiming | there was not the faintest suggestion of high tragedy in her manner | to a casual observer it was merely the somewhat proud and cold reserve of a lady in a public place while under the eyes of a strange and miscellaneous assemblage | graydon imagined that it might veil some resentment because he had been so remiss in his attentions | he could scarcely maintain this view however for she was as cordial to him as to any one while at the same time giving the impression that he was scarcely in her thoughts at all | mr muir was perplexed also and watched her with furtive admiration |  if she cares for graydon's neglect she's a superb actress he thought |  great scott | what an idiot he is that he cannot see the difference between this grand woman and yonder white faced speculator | she actually quickens the blood in my veins to night when she fixes her great black eyes on me | the upper story is also decagonal and is reached by a flight of modern stone steps | the roof is composed of a single block of istrian limestone scooped out like a shallow bowl inside and being the biggest roof stone i ever saw i will give you the dimensions | it is thirty six feet in diameter hollowed out to the depth of ten feet four feet thick at the center and two feet nine inches at the edges and is estimated to weigh two hundred tons | amalasuntha must have had help in getting it up there | the lower story is partly under water | the green grass of the inclosure in which it stands is damp enough for frogs | an old woman opened the iron gate to let us in | whether she was any relation of the ancient proprietor i did not inquire but she had so much trouble in turning the key in the rusty lock and letting us in that i presume we were the only visitors she has had for some centuries | old women abound in ravenna at least she was not young who showed us the mausoleum of galla placidia | placidia was also prudent and foreseeing and built this once magnificent sepulcher for her own occupation | it is in the form of a latin cross forty six feet in length by about forty in width | the floor is paved with rich marbles the cupola is covered with mosaics of the time of the empress and in the arch over the door is a fine representation of the good shepherd | behind the altar is the massive sarcophagus of marble its cover of silver plates was long ago torn off in which are literally the ashes of the empress | she was immured in it as a mummy in a sitting position clothed in imperial robes and there the ghastly corpse sat in a cypress wood chair to be looked at by anybody who chose to peep through the aperture for more than eleven hundred years till one day in 1577 some children introduced a lighted candle perhaps out of compassion for her who sat so long in darkness when her clothes caught fire and she was burned up a warning to all children not to play with a dead and dry empress | in this resting place are also the tombs of honorius ii her brother of constantius iii her second husband and of honoria her daughter | there are no other undisturbed tombs of the caesars in existence | hers is almost the last and the very small last of a great succession | what thoughts of a great empire in ruins do not force themselves on one in the confined walls of this little chamber | what a woman was she whose ashes lie there | she saw and aided the ruin of the empire but it may be said of her that her vices were greater than her misfortunes | and what a story is her life | born to the purple educated in the palace at constantinople accomplished but not handsome at the age of twenty she was in rome when alaric besieged it | carried off captive by the goths she became the not unwilling object of the passion of king adolphus who at length married her at narbonne | at the nuptials the king in a roman habit occupied a seat lower than hers while she sat on a throne habited as a roman empress and received homage | fifty handsome youths bore to her in each hand a dish of gold one filled with coin and the other with precious stones a small part only these hundred vessels of treasure of the spoils the goths brought from her country | the music ceased cries of terror resounded but the momentary transfiguration of the girl before him had been so strange and so impressive that graydon forgot all else and still gazed at her with something like awe in his face | her lip trembled for the nervous tension was growing too severe |  why do you look at me so | she faltered |  what has happened | is there danger |  what has happened madge that i cannot understand you | the electric gleam made you look like an angel of light | your face seemed light itself | are you so true and good madge that such vivid radiance brings out no stain or fear | what is it that makes you unlike others | instinctively he looked toward miss wildmere | her face was buried in her hands and mr arnault was bending over her with reassuring words | madge felt her self control departing |  mary is afraid in a thunderstorm she said in a low tone |  i'll go to her | she does not find me so puzzling and she hastened away yet not so swiftly but that he saw her quivering lip and look of trouble | he took a few impulsive steps in pursuit then hesitated and walked irresolutely down a hallway that he might have a chance for further thought | the alarm and confusion were so great that the little episode had been unnoted | it had made an impression on graydon however that he could not shake off readily | emotion if forced has little power except to repel but even a glimpse of deep suppressed feeling haunts the memory especially if its cause is half in mystery | madge had set her heart on one thing had worked long and patiently for its attainment had hoped and prayed for it and within the last few hours was feeling the bitterness of defeat | the event she so dreaded seemed inevitable even if it had not already occurred | the expression on graydon's face when she had first met him after his long ramble with miss wildmere had been that of a tranquilly happy lover whose heart was at rest in glad certainty | why should he not have spoken | what greater encouragement could he ask than the favor she herself had seen | during his long absence another girl had apparently been waiting for him also but not working for him she sighed and keeping herself aloof from all and everything that would render her less worthy | while i sought to train heart body and soul to be a fit bride she has dallied with every admirer she met and now wins him without one hour of self denial or effort | it is more bitter than death to me | it is cruelty to him for that selfish girl will never make him happy | even after he marries her he will be only one among many and the ballroom glare will be more to her than the light of her own hearth | such thoughts had been in madge's mind and self control had been no easy matter | when to all had been added the excitement of the storm and his unexpected words her overstrained nerves gave way | she was too desperately unhappy for the common fear which temporarily overwhelmed many the greater swallows up the less but the storm had led to words that both wounded and alarmed her | why did she so perplex him | what had the lightning's gleam revealed to be understood when he should think it all over | could the truth of her love of which she was so conscious be detected in spite of her efforts and disguises | was she doomed not only to failure and an impoverished life but also to the humiliation of receiving a lifelong yet somewhat complacent pity from graydon and possibly the triumphant scorn of her rival | with these thoughts surging in her mind she locked herself in her room and sobbed like the broken hearted girl she felt herself to be | the passing storm was nothing to her | a heavier storm was raging in her soul nor had it ceased when the skies without grew cloudless and serene | she at last felt that she must do something to maintain her disguise | hearing little jack crying and mrs muir trying to hush him she washed her eyes and went to the partially darkened room where the child was and said let me take him mary and you go down and see henry |  it's awfully good of you madge | the children have been so frightened that i've been up here all the evening | you seem to have better luck in quieting jack than any of us |  he'll be good with me | go down at once and don't worry | you have hardly had a chance to see henry |  you will come down again after jack goes to sleep |  yes if i feel like it | graydon soon discovered mrs muir after she had joined her husband and asked where is madge |  she has kindly taken the baby so that i can spend a little time with henry | the children have been frightened and jack is very fretful | i'm tired out and don't know what i should do if it wasn't for madge |  why can't the nurse take him |  he won't go to her in these bad moods | madge can quiet him even better than i what's the matter that you are so anxious to see madge | you have seemed abundantly able to amuse yourself without her the last few days | is mr arnault in the way to night |  as if i cared a rap for him | said graydon turning irritably away | he did care however and felt that miss wildmere was making too much use of the liberty she had provided for | she like many others could be half hysterical while the violence of the storm lasted and yet when quiet was restored was capable of making a jest of her fears and the most of a delightful conjunction of affairs which placed two eligible men at her beck to either of whom she could become engaged before she slept | the arrival of her father had turned the scale decidedly in favor of mr arnault for the latter without revealing his transaction with mr muir had whispered to mr wildmere his conviction that henry muir was borrowing at ruinous interest | this information accorded with the broker's previous knowledge and he was eager that his daughter should decide for arnault at once | this however the wilful girl would not do | she enjoyed the present condition of affairs too well and was not without hope also that her father was mistaken for she felt sure from graydon's manner that he was not aware of his brother's financial peril and this fact inclined her to doubt its existence | she was actuated by the feeling that she had given much time and encouragement to graydon and that now arnault should have his turn | madge had been invisible since the storm and there was nothing to indicate that graydon was disposed to give her much thought | miss wildmere's natural supposition was that he and madge had been like brother and sister once and that the form of the relation still existed but that in their long separation they had grown somewhat indifferent toward each other | she believed that the solicitude she had seen in madge's face on the evening so memorable in the latter's experience was due to the jealousy of an immature sickly girl who had been so humored as to feel that graydon belonged to her | she naturally believed that if there had been anything beyond this it would have been developed by correspondence or else indifference on both sides would not now be so palpable | she disliked madge chiefly as a rival in beauty and admiration | nothing could be more clear than that graydon was completely under the spell of her own fascination and that madge was receiving even scant fraternal regard | all she feared was that during the process of keep him well in hand he might become more conscious of madge's attractions which she recognized however much she decried them openly | even if compelled by circumstances to accept arnault she proposed to herself the triumph of rejecting graydon and thought she could do this so skilfully as to give the idea that he had made a deep impression on her heart and so eventually win him again as one of her devoted followers in the future | this product of fashionable society had not the slightest intention of giving up her career as a belle for the sake of mr arnault or any one else | she had more liking and less fear for graydon than for arnault | the latter was an open resolute suitor but she knew that he was controlled more by ambition than by affection that he would yield everything and submit to anything up to a certain point | the moment she jeopardized his prestige before the world or interfered with his scheme of success she would meet rock like obduracy both before and after marriage | she knew that graydon had a sincere affection for her and a faith in her which even in her egotism she was aware was unmerited that he had a larger gentler and more tolerant nature and would be easier to manage than arnault | her fear of the latter proved his best ally | there was a resolution in his eye since his return this evening that even while it angered her somewhat convinced her that he would not be trifled with | his suit was that of a man who had an advantage which she dared not ignore and her father's manner increased this impression | she felt that her game was becoming delicate and hazardous but she would not forego its delicious excitement or abandon the hope that graydon might still be in a position to warrant her preference | therefore she proposed to yield to arnault as far as she could without alienating muir hoping that the former would soon return to town again and thus more time be secured for her final decision | before the first evening of his rivals advent had passed graydon felt that he must appear to the people in the house as supplanted and his pride was beginning to be touched | mrs muir's words had added to his irritation | the episode with madge had left a decidedly unpleasant impression | he felt not only that he had failed to understand her but that he might be treating her with a neglect which she had a right to resent | her appearance and manner during the storm had almost startled him her abrupt departure had caused sudden and strong compunction and he had wished that they might come to a better understanding but thoughts of her had soon given place to anxiety in regard to miss wildmere | it began to seem strange that the girl who had apparently waited for him so long and who had permitted such unequivocal words and manner on his part that day should now before his very eyes be accepting attentions even more unmistakable from another man | she had tried to explain and prepare him for all this but there was more than he was prepared for | she not only danced oftener with arnault than with any one else but also strolled with him on the dusky piazza which by reason of the dampness due to the storm was almost deserted | graydon had permitted his brow to become clouded and was so perturbed by the events of the evening that he had not disguised his vexation by gallantries to others | at last he detected smiles and whispered surmises on the part of some who had seen his devotion before the arrival of mr arnault | this almost angered him and he felt that miss wildmere had imposed a r le that would be difficult to maintain | he had lingered conspicuously near intent on proving his loyalty and had hoped every moment that his opportunity would come | he felt that she should at least divide her time evenly with him and mr arnault but the evening was drawing to a close and the latter had received the lion's share | after noting that others were observing his desolation he went resolutely out on the piazza with the intention of asking miss wildmere to give him the last waltz | its wide space was deserted | he waited a few moments thinking that the object of his thoughts would turn the corner in her promenade with his rival | time passed and she did not come | he looked through a parlor window thinking that she might have entered by some other means of ingress and while he was standing there steps slowly approached from a part of the piazza which was usually in utter darkness and which was known as the lovers' retreat | as the figures passed a lighted window he recognized them and was also observed | he was too angry and jealous now to carry out his purpose and returned to the general hallway | here he was joined a moment later by miss wildmere and mr arnault and the former began to chat with him in imperturbable ease while the gentleman bowed and sought another partner for the waltz that was about to be danced | graydon would not show his chagrin under the many eyes directed toward them but she nevertheless saw his anger in the cold expression of his eyes and realized her danger | she ignored everything with inimitable skill and sweetness and there was nothing for him to do but take her out with the others | indeed it almost instantly became his policy to convince observers that their surmises were without foundation | he determined that the girl should show him all the favor his rival had enjoyed or else a sudden flash of his eyes indicated to his observant companion that all her skill would be required | she was graciousness itself and when arnault could not observe her stole swift and almost pleading glances into her partner's eyes | another observed her however | madge did come down at last for she had concluded that the memorable day should not close until she had had one more glimpse of the problem which had grown so dark and hopeless | graydon soon observed her standing in the doorway but then she was talking and laughing with a lady friend | a moment later she glided out on the floor with one of a half dozen who had been waiting for the favor | graydon sought to catch her eye but did not succeed | again she made upon his mind the impression of troubled perplexity but his purpose was uppermost and he was bent on carrying it out |  come he said to miss wildmere in quiet tones i should enjoy a stroll on the piazza the room has grown so warm and close | feeling that she must yield she did so with ready grace and apparent willingness and graydon led her out through the main entrance that it might be observed that he received no less favor than had been given to another |  she is playing them both pretty strong whispered one of the committee before referred to that sits perpetually on the phases of life at such resorts |  i feared you would not be very patient said miss wildmere in a low tone |  i said i would be reasonably patient was the reply |  reason again |  yes miss wildmere i think i can justly say that i am endowed with both heart and reason | there are some questions in life that demand both |  please do not speak so coldly | you do not understand |  i wish i did |  be patient and you will | after maintaining friendship true and strong for years it hurts me to be misjudged now |  but miss wildmere he began impetuously |  hush she said hastily then added a little coldly if i am not worthy of a little trust i am not worthy of anything | graydon was touched to the quick | honorable himself he felt that he was acting meanly and suspiciously that his jealousy and irritation were leading him to unmanly conduct | there was some reason for her course which would be explained eventually and he ought not to ask a woman to be his wife at all unless he could trust her | therefore he said humbly |  i beg your pardon | in my heart i believe you worthy of all trust | i will wait and be as patient as you desire since i know that you cannot have failed to understand me | then he added with a deprecating laugh there are times i suppose when all men are a little blind and unreasonable |  heaven keep him blind | she thought yet she winced under his honest words in their contrast with herself |  i hope some day to prove worthy of your trust she breathed softly and looked in dread into the darkness lest in some way her words should reach arnault |  come please she added with a gentle pressure on his arm let us return or the hotel may be closed upon us |  please give me all the time you can pleaded graydon as they paused at the door | looking within she saw arnault with his back toward them and said hastily and as if impulsively i will all that i can | possibly my regret will be deeper than yours that i cannot give you more |  you should know that that is not possible he said in low earnest tones | then he added in a whisper as she was entering i can trust you now and wait |  my good fortune is still in the ascendant was her thought i can still keep him in hand in spite of papa and mr |arnault   her father's relations with mr arnault must give him some hold upon her he thought and for her father's sake she cannot yield to me at once but she will eventually | mr arnault came forward with smiling lips light words yet resolute eyes | graydon felt that he had received all the assurance that he needed that she was under some necessity of keeping his rival in good humor so he smiled significantly into her eyes and bowed himself away |  muir looked as if he had received all the comfort that he required arnault said as they strolled across the parlor now deserted |  did he | well he did not require very much |  how much |  you had better ask him |  stella he said and there was a suggestion of menace in his tone i'm in earnest now | you will soon have to choose between us |  shall i | she replied bending upon him an arch bewildering smile |  then please don't speak as if i had no choice at all and she was going |  wait he said |  will you drive with me to morrow | yes  is there anything else your lordship would like | he seized her hand and held it in both his |  this he said |  is that all | was her laughing reply as she withdrew it |  i wish you had more of mr muir's diffidence and she vanished before he could speak again | graydon found that madge had retired so that there was no chance for him to speak to her that night but his mind was in too happy a tumult to give her much thought | chapter xvi declaration of independence mrs muir came into madge's room for a bit of the gossip that she dearly loved but as usual obtained little information or surmise from the young girl |  i'm glad you came down she said if only to prove to graydon that you were not moping upstairs |  why should i mope upstairs | madge asked with a keen look at her sister |  no reason that i know of only graydon has been slightly spoiled by his success among ladies and society men are always imagining that girls are languishing for them |  have i given him or anyone such an impression | madge again inquired indignantly |  oh no indeed | on the contrary you seem so indifferent as not to be quite natural | even graydon feels it and is perplexed and troubled | he was inquiring for you during the evening and i told him you were kindly caring for jack so that i might have a little fresh air with henry on the piazza |  there it is again perplexed and troubled | i'm sick of being misunderstood so ridiculously | the scraps of time that he gives me when miss wildmere does not fill his eyes and thoughts are employed in criticism | why should i perplex and trouble him | i have told him to please himself with miss wildmere that i should certainly please myself in my choice of friends and that he as a man assuredly had a right to do the same | he will soon be engaged to her and probably is already but he has no right to demand that i should receive this girl with open arms | she already detests me and i do not admire her | it's none of my business but if i were a man i wouldn't stand her flirtation with mr arnault | even the people in the house are observing it with significant smiles | he must get over the impression that i'm the weak limp child in mind or body that he left | i'm an independent woman and have as much right to my thoughts and ways as he to his | if he wants my society let him treat me with natural friendliness | if he's afraid to do it if miss wildmere won't let him rest assured i won't receive any furtive deprecatory attentions | i am abundantly able to take care of myself in my own way |  oh madge you have so changed | before you went away the sun seemed to rise and set in graydon |  well the sun now rises in the west and sets in the east what am i saying | well perhaps it's true for me after all | in the west i gained the power to live a strong resolute life of my own choosing and he may as well recognize the truth first as last | let him give all his thoughts to miss wildmere | from what i see and have heard she will keep them busy before and after marriage |  he's not engaged to her yet he said so positively |  oh well madge replied with well assumed indifference although her heart bounded at the tidings it's only a question of time | there we've talked enough about her | of course i remember graydon's old kindness and all that and if he would treat me with frank and sensible friendliness i should enjoy his society | why not |  i thought he regarded you as his sister |  sister indeed | i'm henry's sister not his | i'm only an object of criticism of perplexity a sphinx and all that kind of nonsense | he was bent on seeing a 'little ghost ' as he used to call me | i'm not a bit of a ghost and have as much proud blood in my veins as he has |  well madge i'm glad you feel that you are henry's sister | he likes and admires you so much that i'm half jealous |  henry and i understand each other | he thinks i'm sensible and i certainly think he is | good night now dear | it's after twelve and i wish you a merry fourth of july i mean to have one | graydon had not found himself in a sleeping mood until the shadows of night were almost ready to depart and so came down very late | mrs wildmere who was on the piazza with her child informed him with a deprecatory smile that stella had gone to drive with mr arnault | he bit his lip and went to make a leisurely breakfast | by the time he had finished madge came in with a party of young people who had been on a ramble | her greeting was friendly but nothing more and having received a long letter from mrs wayland she took it to a small summer house | graydon soon strayed after her in a listless way and in no very amiable humor | the greater anxiety had swallowed up the less and his perturbed thoughts about madge were now following a light carriage on some wild mountain road | his generous glow of feeling of the night before had passed somewhat and he was inclined to think that miss wildmere's relations to arnault whatever they were placed him a committed lover in a rather anomalous position | since she was absent however he would while away an hour with madge and try to solve the riddle she had become | she greeted him with a slight smile and went on with her letter | he watched her curiously and with contracting brow |  will you ever finish | he soon asked |  i can read it some other time she said laying it down |  oh that is asking far too much |  is it |  confound it madge | why is it that we are drifting further and further apart every day |  i am not drifting she said quietly nor do you give that impression | i am just where you found me on your return | since we are so far apart you must be doing the journeying |  well heaven knows i found you distant enough |  i beg your pardon heaven knows nothing of the kind | it's not my fault that you value friendship so lightly |  you know i wished for so much more |  you thought you did at first graydon she replied with a quiet smile but i imagine that you soon became quite reconciled to my view of the case | the relation would surely prove embarrassing to you | haven't you since thought that it might | she asked with sweet directness | he colored visibly and was provoked with himself that he did |  if you persist in being at swords' points with miss wildmere he began hesitatingly |  i persist in being simply myself and true to my own perceptions | wherein have i failed in courtesy toward miss wildmere |  but you dislike her most cordially |  and you like her most cordially and more | have i not granted your perfect right to do so |  if you were even the friend you claim to be you would not be so indifferent |  i have not said i was indifferent | miss wildmere is far from indifferent to me | what have i done to gain her ill will |  much as human nature goes | you have made yourself her rival in beauty and attractiveness |  is that human nature | if that is the cause of her hostility i should say it is miss wildmere's nature |  let us change the subject said graydon a little irritably |  we shall not agree on this point i fear you share in henry's prejudices |  i did not introduce the subject graydon and i think for myself |  hang it all madge | you are so changed i scarcely know you | every time we meet i find you more of a conundrum | friend indeed | you certainly have been a distant one in every sense | if i had been the friend you say i was you would have written me about the marvellous transformation you were accomplishing | she sprang up and her dark eyes flashed indignantly |  i am beginning to think that you are changed more than i she said impetuously |  you know or might if you took the trouble that i did not tell mary my own sister of my progress toward health and strength | my wish to give you all a pleasant surprise may seem a little thing to you or you may give some sinister unnatural meaning to the act | it was not a little thing to go away 'a ghost a wraith ' as you were wont to call me it was not a little thing to go away alone perhaps to die as i then felt | nor was it a little thing to battle for weary months with weakness of mind and body morbid timidity indolence ignorance and everything that was contrary to my ideal of womanhood | i can say thus much in self defence | was there harm in my adding some incentive to a hard sense of duty | i felt that if i could change for the better and keep my secret i could give you all a glad surprise | i had almost a child's pleasure in the thought | mary and henry rewarded me but you are spoiling it all | you at once make an impossible demand and discover within twenty four hours how awkward my compliance would have been | i did not know you so long without gaining the power of guessing your thoughts | i suggested a simple natural relation and as the result i have become a 'conundrum '| a charming title truly | i shall remain a simple natural girl and when you are through with your riddle theories perhaps you will treat me as i think you might in view of old times and she started swiftly toward the house | madge  cried graydon springing up and following her | at that moment miss wildmere approached and madge gained the piazza and disappeared leaving graydon ill disposed toward himself and all the world even including miss wildmere for she had a charming color and appeared not in the least a victim to ennui because of forced association with an objectionable party | she came smilingly toward him saying it's too bad to interrupt your hot pursuit of another lady but girls have not much conscience in such matters |  as long as you have conscience in other matters it does not signify he answered meaningly |  not conscience but another organ controls our action chiefly i imagine she replied with a glance that gave emphasis to her words of the previous evening and she passed smilingly on | arnault soon followed her spoke pleasantly to graydon and having obtained a morning paper was at once absorbed in its contents |  he does not appear like a baffled suitor who has enjoyed only a veiled tolerance was graydon's thought |  things will come out all right in the end i suppose but they certainly are not proceeding as i expected | stella will be mine eventually it were treason to think otherwise but she is carrying it off rather boldly to keep arnault so complacent at the same time | as far as madge is concerned i've been a fool and made a mess of it | how in the mischief has she been able to divine my very thoughts | she is wrong in one respect however | if she had felt and acted toward me like a sister i would have been loyal to her and would have compelled even miss wildmere to recognize her rights | i am not so far gone but that i can act in a straightforward honorable way | my acceptance of her action was an afterthought a philosophical way i have of making the best of everything | i now believe that it has turned out for the best but i have been guilty of no coldblooded calculation | very well i'll treat her as a simple natural girl and my very good friend and see how this course works | not that she is a simple girl | i've met too many of that kind and of those also who enshroud themselves in a cloud of little feminine mysteries all transparent enough to one of experience but madge does puzzle me | she has not explained herself with her fine burst of indignation |jove  how handsome she was | she ever gives the impression that there is something back of all she says and does | even henry feels it in his dim way but that lightning flash made it clear that it is something of which she need not be ashamed | since she has learned to read me so understandingly i will try to fathom her thoughts | perhaps friendship does mean more to her than to others | if so i'll be as true a friend to her as she to me | if i grant stella such broad privileges with arnault she must admit mine with one of whom it would be absurd to be jealous and with cogitations like the above he also pretended to read his paper and finished his cigar | chapter xvii not strong in vain graydon dreaded embarrassment when meeting madge at dinner but was agreeably disappointed | there was nothing in the young girl's manner which suggested a vexed consciousness of their recent interview neither were there covert overtures even in tones toward more friendly relations | he saw that if any were made he must make them | madge was merely too well bred to show anger in public or occasion surmises that would require explanations | during the meal she spoke of missing her horseback exercise and said that she meant to ask dr sommers if he did not know of a good animal that might be hired for a few weeks | graydon at once resolved to make a propitiatory offering and to go out with madge when miss wildmere was unattainable | for the time he was content to imitate madge's tactics and acted as if he intended to follow the course that she had suggested | the fact that arnault was so evidently enjoying his dinner and the wildmere smiles did not detract from his purpose to prove that he also was not without resources | moreover he felt that he had not treated madge fairly he had been truly fond of her and now was conscious of a growing respect | as she had said it was not a little thing that she had attempted and accomplished and there had been small ground for his discontent | after dinner however he found a chance to ensconce himself by miss wildmere on the piazza and he was fully resolved to lose no such opportunities | madge with the muir children passed him on the way to a small lake on which she had promised to give the little people a row | he took off his hat in cordial courtesy and she recognized him with a brief smile in which miss wildmere could detect no apprehension |  i hope that 'sister madge ' as you call her does not resent my enjoyment of your society |  not in the least | i feel however that i have been neglecting her shamefully and propose to make amends |  indeed has she brought you to a sense of your shortcomings | this scarcely bears out your first remark |  it is nothing against its truth | miss aldeu makes it very clear that she is not dependent on me or any one for enjoyment but in view of the past i have been scarcely courteous | therefore he added with a laugh when arnault monopolizes you i shall console myself with madge |  and therefore i shall feel the less compunction | thank you |  i am glad to take the least thorn from the roses of your life was his smiling answer | she veiled close scrutiny under her reply: i fear the brilliant miss alden will cause my society to appear commonplace in contrast |  i do not see how you can fear anything of the kind was his prompt answer i trust you and you must trust me |  i do trust you mr muir she said softly | before he could speak again nurses and children came streaming and screaming from the lake toward the house |  nellie wilder is drowned was the burden of their dire message | graydon sprang down the steps and rushed with the fleetness of the wind toward the lake | as madge with jennie and harry muir approached the water they saw a party of children playing carelessly in a boat and a moment later a little girl fell overboard | the boat was in motion toward the shore and when she rose it had passed beyond her reach | her companions gave way to wild panic and instead of trying to save her screamed and pulled for land | no one was present except nurses and other children and they all joined in the wild helpless chorus of alarm and began a stampede toward the hotel | madge saw that if the child was saved she must act promptly and wisely | to the muir children she said authoritatively sit down where you are and don't move | then she rushed forward and unfastened a skiff | as she did so the child rose for the last time and sunk again with a gurgling cry | keeping her eyes fixed on the spot and with an oar in her hand madge pushed away from the shore vigorously with her feet and with the impetus sprang upon the narrow stern sheets then crept forward toward the bow at the same time ever keeping her eyes fixed unwaveringly on the spot where the child had sunk from which widening circles were eddying | the nurses and children who had not started for the house seeing that a rescue was attempted looked on with breathless dread and suspense | when the impetus that madge had first given to the skiff ceased she kept the little craft in motion by paddling first on one side then on the other her eyes still fixed on one point in the dark water | at last this point seemed almost beneath her she dropped the oar stooped and peered over the side of the boat | after a moment's hesitation she appeared to those on shore to have lost her balance fallen overboard and sunk | renewed screams of terror resounded and the muir children fled toward the hotel crying aunt madge is drowned |  what do you mean | graydon gasped seizing harry by the arm |  oh uncle graydon | run quick | aunt madge fell out of a boat under water | a moment later he saw the young girl rise to the surface with a child in her grasp | with one headlong plunge and a few strong strokes he was at her side exclaiming great god madge | what does this mean |  take her to the shore quick no matter about me and she pushed the limp and apparently lifeless form into his arms |  but madge he began | haste haste  and the child may be saved | don't think of me i can swim as well as you and she struck out toward the shore | wondering and thrilled with admiration in spite of the confusion of his thoughts he did as directed and took the child to land at once | madge was there as soon as he crying even before she left the water run for dr sommers and if not at home ride after him | meanwhile gentlemen and employ s of the house were arriving and some turned back in search of the physician | the awful tidings had come upon poor mrs wilder the mother of the child like a bolt out of a clear sky and she had run screaming and moaning toward the scene of disaster | mother love had given her almost superhuman strength but when she saw the pale little face on the ground with the hue of death upon it she crouched beside it in speechless agony and watched the efforts that were made to bring back consciousness | madge led and directed these efforts | in truth she did as much to save the child on land as when it had lain submerged on the muddy bottom of the pond | graydon seeing that she was coming up the bank had paused a moment irresolutely and then was about to start for the hotel with his burden | madge caught his arm and took the child from him |  graydon take off your coat and give it to me she said imperatively as she laid the child down on its back your handkerchief also she added | she forced open the pale lips and wiped out the mouth with marvellous celerity paying no heed to the clamorous voices around her |  some one give me a sharp knife she cried and don't crowd so near | lifting the child's clothing at the throat she cut it down ward to the waist then down each arm leaving the lovely little form exposed and free | dropping the knife she next rolled the coat into a bundle turned the child over so that her abdomen should rest upon it then with hands pressed rather strongly on each side of the little back madge sought to expel the water that might have been swallowed | turning the child over on her back again the bundle made by the coat was placed under the small of her back so as to raise the chest | then catching the little tongue that had awakened merry echoes but a few moments before she drew it out of the mouth to one side by the aid of the handkerchief and said to graydon hold it so | all now saw that they were witnessing skilled efforts | discordant advice ceased and they looked on with breathless interest |  has any one smelling salts | madge asked | there was no response | she snatched a bit of grass and tickled the child's nose saying at the same time bring water | this after a few seconds she dashed over the face and exposed chest waited an instant then gave her patient a slap over the pit of the stomach | graydon kneeling before her looked on with silent amazement | her glorious eyes shone with an absorbed and merciful purpose she was oblivious of her own strange appearance the masses of her loosening hair falling over and veiling the lovely form outlined clearly by the wet and clinging drapery of her summer dress | others looked on in wonder too and with a respect akin to awe | among them were her sister and henry muir mr arnault and miss wildmere her feelings divided between envy and commiseration for the child and its stricken mother | these first simple efforts having no apparent effect madge said quietly we must try artificial respiration | move a little more to one side graydon | kneeling behind the child she lifted the little arms quickly but steadily up over and down until they lay upon the ground behind the wet golden curls | this motion drew the ribs up expanded the chest and permitted air to enter it | after two or three seconds madge reversed the motion and pressed the arms firmly against the chest to expel the air | this alternate motion was kept up regularly at about the rate of sixteen times a minute until the sound of a galloping horse was heard and the crowd parted for dr sommers | he took in the situation with his quick eye and said miss alden let me take your place |  oh thank god you are here | she exclaimed |  let me hold her tongue graydon i must do something |  yes mr muir added the physician let her help me she knows just what to do | how long was the child under water |  i don't know exactly not long |  not more than four or five minutes |  i think not |  there should be hope then |  we must save her | cried madge |  i once saw people work over an hour before there were signs of life |  oh god bless your brave heart | murmured the poor mother |  you won't leave my child you won't let them give her up will you |  no mrs wilder not for one hour or two | i believe that your little girl will be saved |  have some brandy ready said dr sommers | a flask was produced and graydon again knelt near to have it in readiness while the doctor kept up his monotonous effort pressing the arms against the lungs then lifting them above the head and back to the ground with regular and mechanical iteration | the child's eyelids began to tremble | ah  exclaimed the doctor a moment later there was a slight choking cough and a glad cry went up from the throng |  the brandy said the doctor | madge now gave up the case to him and graydon and slipped down beside the mother who was swaying from side to side |  don't faint she said your child will need you as soon as she is conscious |  oh heaven bless you | heaven bless you | cried the mother you have saved my only my darling |  yes madam you are right | it's all plain sailing now the doctor added | then madge became guilty of her first useless act | in strong revulsion she fainted dead away | in a moment her head was on mrs muir's lap and henry muir was at her side |  poor girl | no wonder | there's not a woman in a hundred thousand who could do what she has done | there don't worry about her | put her in my carriage with mrs muir and take her to her room i'll be there soon | she'll come out all right such girls always do | meanwhile mr muir and graydon were carrying out the doctor's directions and the unconscious girl was borne rapidly to her apartment where under her sister's ministrations she soon revived | almost her first conscious words after being assured that the child was safe were oh mary | what a guy i must have appeared | what will graydon i mean all who saw me think |  they'll think things that might well turn any girl's head | as for graydon he is waiting outside now half crazy with anxiety to receive a message from you |  tell him i made a fool of myself and he must not speak about it again on the pain of my displeasure |  well you have come to said mrs muir and then she went and laughingly delivered the message verbatim adding go and put on dry clothes | you'll catch your death with those wet things on and you look like a scarecrow | he departed more puzzled over madge alden than ever but admitting to himself that she had earned the right to be anything she pleased | dr sommers continued his efforts in behalf of the little girl chafing her wrists and body with the brandy and occasionally giving a few drops until circulation was well restored and then at her mother's side carried the child to her room and gave directions to those who were waiting to assist | when he entered madge's apartment she greeted him with the words what a silly thing i did |  not at all not at all | you made your exit gracefully and escaped the plaudits which a brave girl like you wouldn't enjoy | i take off my hat to you as we country folks say | you are a heroine as good a doctor as i on shore and a better one in the water | where did you learn it all | nonsense  said madge nothing would vex me more than to have a time made over the affair | it's all as simple as a b c what's that little pond to one who has been used to swimming in the pacific | as i said i saw a girl restored once and mr wayland has explained to me again and again just what to do |  oh yes it's all simple enough if you know how but that's just the trouble | in all that crowd i don't believe there was one who would not have done the wrong thing | well well i can manage now if i'm obeyed | you've had a good deal of a shock and you must keep quiet till to morrow | then i'll see | madge laughingly protested that nothing would please her better than a good supper and a good book |  please give out also she said that any reference to the affair will have a very injurious influence on me | in spite of the doctor messages and flowers poured in | at last mrs wilder came and said to mrs muir i must see her if it is safe |  it's safe enough mrs muir began only madge doesn't like so much made of it |  i won't say much pleaded the mother | she did not say anything but put her arms around madge and pressed her tear stained face upon the young girl's bosom in long passionate embrace the hastened back to her restored treasure who was sleeping quietly | madge's eyes were wet also and she turned her face to the wall and breathed softly to herself whatever happens now and it's plain enough what will happen i did not get strong in vain | graydon can never think me altogether weak and lackadaisical again and i have saved one woman's heart from anguish however my own may ache | chapter xviii make your terms graydon's uppermost thought now was to make his peace with madge | he dismissed all his former theories about her as absurd and felt that whether he understood her or not she had become a splendid woman of whose friendship he might well be proud and accept it on any terms that pleased her | he also was sure that miss wildmere's prejudices would be banished at once and forever by madge's heroism believing that the girl's hostile feeling was due only to the natural jealousy of social rivals |  if stella does not regard madge's action with generous enthusiasm i shall think the worse of her was his masculine conclusion | the wily girl was not so obtuse as to be unaware of this and when he came down she said all he could wish in praise of madge but took pains to enlarge upon his own courage | at this he pooh poohed emphatically |  what was that duck pond of a lake to a man | he said |  madge herself has become an expert ocean swimmer i am told | she wasn't afraid of the water | it was her skill in finding the child beneath it and in resuscitation afterward that chiefly commands my admiration |  oh dear | cried the girl what can i do to command your admiration |  you know well miss wildmere that you command much more | she blushed smiled and looked around a little apprehensively |  don't be alarmed he added i have such confidence in you that i will bide your time |  thank you graydon she whispered and hastened away leaving him supremely happy | it was the first time she had called him graydon | seeing dr sommers emerging from the hotel he hastened after him bent on procuring a peace offering for madge the finest horse that could be had in the region |  i know of one a few miles from here said the doctor |  he's a splendid animal but a high and mighty stepper | i don't believe that even she could manage him |  i'll break him in for her never fear | of course i won't let her take any risks |  well leave it to me then | i can manage it | he's awfully headstrong though | i give you fair warning |  take me to see him as soon as you can the horse i mean or rather both man and horse |  to morrow morning then | i have patients out that way | at supper and during the evening madge and her exploit were the themes of conversation | some tried to give graydon a part of the credit but he laughed so contemptuously at the idea that he was let alone | henry muir did not say much but looked a great deal and with graydon listened attentively as his wife explained how it was that madge had proved equal to the emergency |  why don't more people follow her example | said the practical man and learn how to do something definite | as she explains the rescue there was nothing remarkable in it | if she could swim and dive in the ocean for sport she would not be much afraid to do the same in that so called lake to save life | as to her action on shore the knowledge she used is given in books and manuals | what's more she had seen it done | but most people are so pointless and shiftless that they never know just what to do in an emergency no matter what their opportunities for information may have been |  now you hit me graydon remarked ruefully left to myself i should have finished the young one for i was about to run to the hotel with her a course that i now see would have been as fatal as idiotic |  madge says mrs muir continued that they used to bathe a great deal and that mr wayland explained just what should be done in all the possible emergencies of their outdoor life at santa barbara |  wayland in a level headed man | if he is bookish he's not a dreamer with his head in the clouds | madge was in good hands with them and proves it every day |  i think she shows the influence of mrs wayland even more than that of her husband | fanny is a very accomplished woman and saw a great deal of society in her younger days |  confound it all | why didn't you tell me that madge had been living with two paragons | said graydon |  oh you have been so occupied with another paragon that there has not been much chance to tell you anything was mrs muir's consoling reply |  madge has not been made what she is by paragons mr muir remarked dryly |  she made herself | they only helped her and couldn't have helped a silly woman |  it's time you were jealous mary said graydon laughing |  mary isn't a silly woman | i should hope that no muir would marry one |  i see no prospect of it was the rather cold reply |  i fear i see a worse prospect was his brother's thought |  of what use are his eyes or senses after what he has seen to day | mrs muir had explained to some lady friends about madge and the information was passing into general circulation the ladies rapidly coming to the conclusion that the young girl's action was not so remarkable after all which was true enough | the men however retained their enthusiastic admiration although it must be admitted that its inspiration was due largely to madge's beauty |  of course women have done braver things said one man with sporting tendencies but it was the neat gamy way in which she did it that took my eye | her method was as complete and rounded out as herself |jove  as she bent over that child she was a nymph that would turn the head of a greek |  she has evidently turned the head of a cyprian laughed one of his friends |  come that's putting it too strong said the man with a frown |  i'll affect no airs though | i'm not a saint as you all know but the aspect of that girl in her self forgetful effort might well make me wish i were one | she is as good and pure hearted as the child she saved | if there had been a flaw in the white marble of her nature she would have been self conscious | an angel from heaven couldn't have been more absorbed in the one impulse to save | graydon had approached the group unobserved and heard these words | he walked away smiling with the thought my sentiments clearly expressed | the night was warm and he saw miss wildmere and arnault going out for a stroll | following a half defined inclination he bent his steps toward the lake | the moon was mirrored in its glassy surface the place silent and deserted | with slight effort of fancy he called up the scene again | he saw in the moonlight the fairy form of the child and what even others had regarded as the embodiment of human loveliness and truth bending over it |  and she was the little ghost that once haunted me he thought and seemed all eyes and affection | how those eyes used to welcome and turn to me as if in some subtle way she drew from me the power to exist at all | i wish i could follow the processes of her change from the hour of our parting and see how i passed from what i was to her to what i am now | i have rarely if ever seen in any part of the world so fascinating an assemblage of all that would render a country party agreeable as was here collected in one of the most out of the way corners of ireland | my worthy captain's advice was now thrown to the winds and indeed any heart aged twenty two must have been made of cast iron to have resisted the rides and walks the picnic dinners the dances and the music parties and suppers besides the infinitely varied round of other amusements grave and gay which contributed to render and will for ever preserve this nook of ireland the true terrestrial paradise of my early days | how the deuce i ever contrived to get out of the magic circle i hardly know but if i could only feel myself at liberty without a breach of confidence to give a few details of those hours i would stake great odds on the side of the effect which the description of such a reality might produce against the interest of the imaginary scenes in almost any romance | i have already mentioned that the gentleman whose introduction i carried was most urgent for me to deliver the letter in person but he gave no reasons for this anxiety nor indeed was i then aware that besides his being an intimate friend he was their family physician | while acting in this capacity he had seen with regret how ineffectual his art had proved to alleviate the mother's sorrow caused by the recent loss of her favourite son | the young man had been in the navy and would have been about my own age and standing in the service | these accidental coincidences suggested to her judicious and kind hearted friend that as i in some degree resembled him in appearance and in manners the poor mother's thoughts and feelings might possibly be diverted into a new channel by the society of a person in so many respects similarly circumstanced to the child she had lost | it so happened fortunately for me that the experiment completely succeeded i hope and believe to the mother's consolation | to me of course the reception i met with was matter of delight and astonishment so much so indeed that i occasionally felt somewhat startled and almost oppressed with the sense of obligation imposed by such unusual and unmerited attentions | the first explanation of the mystery is really so touching in itself that i give it without reserve as i received it in a letter from this most excellent old lady about six months after my first acquaintance with her and just before i quitted england for the east indies: once more adieu | she concludes i must hope you will write to me often let me constantly know how you proceed and how i can address you and recollect you have received the freedom of this house | i believe i told you i had lost a son a lieutenant in the navy and of superior talents | i therefore consider that heaven has given you to my care in his place and may the almighty protect you | chapter iii | tricks upon travellers | a curious and vastly pleasing fashion prevails in that part of ireland where i was so nearly bewitched as almost to forget my ship my duties and everything else but beauty | when a party such as i have been describing had passed a certain time together they seldom broke up entirely but generally shifted or emigrated in a body flitted i think they used to call it to the house of some one of their number | now and then various members of the group dropped off by the way but their places were presently filled up by others who soon found their way to the new hive when the well known sounds of festivity were heard in the neighbourhood | in this manner the party into which i had been so kindly admitted made several moves with sundry losses and accessions to its numbers and as every day rendered this life more and more grateful i could scarcely bear to think of returning to the tame occupations and rugged society of the frigate the duties of which had so recently been my greatest and most sincere delight | meanwhile since my good natured captain and still better natured messmates made no difficulties about this protracted absenteeism i continued to involve myself deeper and deeper at every step | i failed not to perceive at times that i was getting into rather a dangerous scrape for a younger son and a young officer who had yet to work his own way in the world | but as these reflections interfered rather impertinently with the enjoyments of the hour they were crushed down and kept out of sight as much as possible at that gay period | what surprised me most all this time was the air of refinement and high polish in the irish society amongst which i was thus casually thrown | i had previously entertained an idea that their hospitality proverbial in all parts of the world was of a rude and rather troublesome description | i found it on the contrary marked not only by the strongest lines of sincerity and kindness but by many of those delicate touches of consideration for the feelings of others which form the most indubitable symptoms of genuine good breeding | instead of discovering that the stories were true about the sort of compulsion used in matters of drinking i can safely say that during the course of experience in joviality i went through in the north of ireland i seldom met with anything at a gentleman's table approaching even to exigence on this score | i do not deny that our friends the irish have a wonderfully winning way of insinuating their good cheer upon us and sometimes of inducing us to swallow more claret than is perhaps good for us | i landed once at burncrana a pretty quiet little village with a watering place look on the eastern banks of that great and beautiful bay lough swilly | one side of this fine harbour is formed by the bold promontory of inishowen celebrated in every land for its noble whiskey second only which as a scotchman i am bound to assert to ferntosh or glenlivet | i was accompanied by an english gentleman on the first day of his landing in ireland | as he then seriously imagined the inhabitants to belong to a sort of wild and uncouth race i could see he was rather surprised at the gentleman like deportment of an acquaintance of mine resident on the spot for whom he had brought a letter | we had walked together to his house or rather cottage for he was not a fixed resident but came there for summer quarters | the neatness and even elegance of the domestic arrangements of his temporary establishment both without and within the dwelling gave token of a taste many degrees removed from the state of people far back in civilization | presently the ladies came and their national frankness modified by the most entire and unaffected simplicity puzzled my friend completely | in due season the dressing bell sent us off to prepare for dinner and while we were getting ready my companion said i see what this fellow is at: he means to sew you and me up | you may do as you please but i'll be shot if he plays off his irish pranks on me | i will eat his dinner take a couple of glasses of his wine make my bow to the ladies go on board by eight or nine o'clock and having given them a dinner in return shall have done my duty in the way of attention after which i shall totally cut the connection | i have no idea of their abominable fashion of forcing strangers to drink |  we shall see said i and having knocked the dust off our shoes down we went to dinner | everything was plain and suitable to the pretensions of a cottage | there was no pressing to eat or drink during dinner and in process of time the cloth was removed the ladies sipped a little sweet wine and disappeared |  now for it whispered my friend he has sent the women out of the way that he may ply us the better | and i must own things looked rather suspicious for our host instead of sitting down again at the dinner table walked to a bow window overlooking the anchorage and exactly facing the setting sun at that hour illuminating the whole landscape in the gorgeous style peculiar to combined mountain and lake scenery |  why should we not enjoy this pleasant prospect while we are discussing our wine | said the master of the house | at that instant the door opened and in walked the servant as if he knew by intuition what was passing in his master's head |  tim said our host put the card table here in the bow window and give us some other glasses also if you have such a thing bring up a bottle of claret | tim nodded smiled and made the fitting adjustments | the table was barely large enough to hold a noble long corked bottle for the fashion of claret decanters had not as yet reached that remote district of the empire | round the margin was placed the necessary accompaniment of capacious glasses famous tall fellows with such slender stalks that they seemed scarcely equal to the weight of their generous load | my friend and i exchanged glances and i could see his shoulders slightly raised as if he was saying internally now we are in for it | but i will not drink a drop more than i choose | the claret which in itself was most delicious was cooled in perfect style | the party consisted i think of four or five persons and this one bottle i remember just passed round the group twice | as the flavour of the beverage appeared to have become more exquisite at the second turn than at the first though but a short interval had been allowed to elapse it seemed odd that another bottle was not instantly called for | instead of this our landlord went on expatiating on the beauties of the lough and the fineness of the season in general and the sunset in particular for full five minutes after the wine had disappeared when he suddenly said with a half hesitating tone towards my english friend who sat at his elbow i beg your pardon | perhaps you would take some more wine | as no one made any objection the bell was rung and tim re appeared bearing with him another bottle | this likewise vanished in a trice and tim was again summoned |  bring some more claret said the master to the man or rather boy as he was called though twice as old as any of the party | at this instant i caught my companion's eye and i could see he was becoming alive to the plot against him so much so indeed that he seemed to be preparing to rise | the following conversation however attracted his attention and fixed him to his seat |  well tim what are you gaping at | why don't you run for the clar't |  i didn't know replied the other whether you'd like to use the whole of it |  use the whole of it | exclaimed his master what does the boy mean | why tim what are you at |  oh sir quoth the well instructed rogue as the wine you brought was but little i thought you might not wish to use it all entirely to day | and then he whispered something in his master's ear the words of which we could not distinguish | the reply however showed or seemed to show what had been said |  nonsense tim nonsense | you're an ass man bring it up | tim accordingly disappeared but soon returned with a basket apparently full of straw at the bottom of which however after some considerable show of hunting a couple of bottles were said to be found |  confound you tim is this all | said the host |  it is sir lied tim and in faith sir added he still lying it's one more bottle than i thought for there was but a dozen when we started from derry a week ago and you know sir you and the collector on last tuesday but the catalogue of circumstances which were intended to act as buttresses to master tim's inventions was cut short by a peremptory order to leave the room | this he did so soon as he had made a circumbendibus to escape notice and deposited the basket behind his master's chair muttering as he put it down with a thump there's a couple of bottles of as good wine as ever was uncorked | the fresh broach was indeed so delicious that we could hardly believe it was of the same vintage as that of the previous bin though our host assured us it was the identical | tim's basket well merited a higher eulogium than he had given it but while his reputation as a judge of wine rose his character for veracity fell in about the same proportion since we beheld in due season not merely two but three and at last a fourth long necked gentleman from bordeaux emerge from under the straw | the trick played upon us by these confederates was now apparent enough but the wine fortunately was of that light and pure kind which does not produce much effect on strong heads and that of my companion was proof against far greater trials than this | he was indeed perfectly aware of what was passing and though dearly loving the wine which was superior to any he had ever before tasted yet he had no notion of being made tipsy by means of a common place concert between host and butler | he therefore rose to leave the room expecting of course to be forcibly detained or at all events being begged and entreated to sit down again | not a whit | the wily native merely observed to him that if he had a mind to admire the prospect there was still daylight enough to command a view down the bay from the little knoll on the right | the englishman was sorely puzzled by all this | there was none of the detention he expected would be practised upon him and yet he had a strong consciousness that he was undergoing the operation well known afloat and ashore by the title of the game of humbug | at the same time he felt the most eager desire to take another good pull at the claret | there was no wine before us at this critical juncture of the evening and our landlord who most unaccountably seemed indifferent to this material circumstance went on prosing for a quarter of an hour about protestant ascendancy the eternal siege of derry the battle of the boyne and such like stale topics | at length one of the company became somewhat impatient and watching for a pause asked his host if it were the custom in ireland to discuss orange politics with empty glasses |  god bless me cried the other with well feigned surprise is there no wine on the table | and ringing the bell furiously scolded poor tim so naturally that the confederate was almost thrown out | well  you numskull why don't you make off with you and bring something for the gentlemen to drink | tim stood fast till interrogated a second time and then replied with perfect gravity that there wasn't another drop of wine in the house | upon this the master got up in a rage and brushing past the servant declared his intention of searching the cellar himself | he was absent some time and we had just prevailed on our hesitating companion to sit down again when as if there had been some electrical communication between his chair and the handle of the door it opened and in walked our generous entertainer exulting in his success crowing like chanticleer and bearing in each hand a couple of bottles clicking against each other while tim with a degree of impudence equalled only by that of his master substituted clean glasses of a still more capacious swallow than the first | to these were added two pair of candles which towered high above the jolly crew and promised to last till another dawn should look in upon our revels | by this time the twilight had almost entirely ebbed away and was succeeded by that cheerful aurora kind of brilliancy in the sky which points out the place of the sun during the whole of his summer night's journey in those high latitudes | politics dropped for the joyous juice of the grape soon melted us all into one mind and a hundred topics of more pleasing interest were started in which the strangers could join without fear of any angry discussion | the mirth and animation of the company rose very pleasantly as each fresh bottle found its way by some magical process to the table | but it became rather difficult to tell who were the listeners amongst us or to say who was guest and who landlord for the party seemed like a circle of brothers all equally at home | this went on for an indefinite length of time but i should be the veriest conjuror on earth to say how long | through the hazy atmosphere of my recollection of that jolly evening i remember that about eleven o'clock more or less our host was enchanted almost beyond the power of words by seeing his wine so much relished and tickled also with the success of his joke in making his suspicious guest drink just as much wine as he thought fit to impose | on this occasion however he inverted the proverb and reckoned without his guest for by one imprudent remark he had well nigh torn the laurels from his brow |  well sir | he exclaimed although this is the first day you ever set foot on the island you have seen enough i hope to satisfy you that we are not quite such savages as you supposed liberty hall you see is the true title of every irish gentleman's dining room: there's no compulsion here you must see very clearly | it was little that my english friend could now see very clearly of anything but the above premature announcement of victory brought back all the stranger's suspicions | fired with this idea he started on his feet and eyeing the door for a long time before he ventured on the voyage with a bold determination and taking a good departure from his chair he gained his port | he had undoubtedly expected to be lugged back again for he whisked the tails of his coat out of reach while with his other hand on the lock of the door and swaying himself about from side to side like a ship in a calm he stood the very image of tottering equilibrium as the mathematicians call it | our adroit landlord who was not a man to shrink from difficulties mustered to his aid all the resources of a long well practised hospitality and gallantly met this great occasion | his devices were probably exhausted so he took another line and called out oh you're off are you | very well you'll find the ladies in the drawing room | i think i hear the tinkle of the piano: i prefer the tinkle of the glass | pray tell the damsels we are coming by and bye: mind you say 'by and bye '| i don't like to be too particular for fear of seeming rude: don't you see | this speech was wound up by a telegraphic flourish of the hand towards tim who stood near with a bottle between his feet the screw buried in the cork and his body bent to the effort which he only delayed to exercise till ordered by his master to pull |  out with him man | out with the cork | cried the host | the loud report which succeeded rang over the apartment like the sweetest music to the souls of the ever thirsty company | tim's thunder was echoed back by a truly bacchanalian shout such as nothing on earth can give proper emphasis to except a double allowance of claret | with all her impulsive ways she's as deep as perdition and she'd flirt with him to spite me if nothing more | papa said last night that i had better accept arnault | i won't accept him till i must and he'll rue his success if he wins it | then the mirror reflected a lovely creature dissolved in tears | again she soliloquized: i can't accept a horse from graydon arnault would never submit to it | the receiving of such a present would compromise me at once | it does not matter so much what i say or look in private this proves nothing to the world and i see more and more clearly that arnault will not permit his pride to be humiliated | he will endure what he calls a fair open suit philosophically but the expression of his eyes makes me shiver sometimes | was ever a girl placed in such a mean and horrible position | i won't endure this shilly shally much longer | if they can't prove something more definite against the muirs i'll accept graydon | papa is just horrid | why can't he make more in wall street | there must be ways and any way is as respectable as the one i may be compelled to take | well if i do have to accept arnault i'll make graydon think that i had to do so for papa's sake and we'll become good friends again before long | perhaps this would be the best way in the end for papa looked wildly and spoke of a tenement house last night |tenement  great heavens | i'd sooner die | chapter xx veiled wooing graydon when do you think i can have my first ride | madge asked at dinner with sparkling eyes |  at about five this afternoon | i have found a saddle that i can borrow in case yours does not come till the late train |  oh i'm so glad that i've lost my appetite | you can't know how much a horse means to me | it was after i began to ride that i grew strong enough to hope |  why madge were you so discouraged as that | he asked feelingly |  i had reason to be discouraged she replied in a low tone | then she threw back her head proudly |  you men little know she continued half defiantly |  you think weakness one of our prerogatives and like us almost the better for it | we are meekly to accept our fate and from soft couches lift our languid eyes in pious resignation | i won't do it and when a powerful horse is beneath me carrying me like the wind i feel that his strength is mine and that i need not succumb to feminine imbecility or helplessness in any form |  brava madge | cried henry muir |  you were born a knight added graydon and have already made more and better conquests than many celebrated in prose and poetry |  oh no cried madge lifting her eyebrows in comic distress |  i was born a woman to my finger tips and never could conquer even myself | i have an awful temper | graydon you have already found that out |  i have found that i had better accept just what you please to be and fully admit your right to be just what you please he answered ruefully |  what a lovely and reasonable frame of mind | mrs muir remarked |  truly miss wildmere is to be congratulated | you have only to stick to such a disposition and peace will last longer than the moon |  oh miss wildmere will prove a rose without a thorn madge added laughing while under mr muir's eye her face paled perceptibly |  there will never be anything problematical in her single minded devotion | she has been well and discreetly brought up and finished by the best society while poor me i had to fly in the face of fate like a virago and scramble up the best i could in western wilds | oh well graydon don't be alarmed | i'll be a good fellow if you'll take me out riding occasionally | he began to laugh and she continued: i saw you frown when i began my wicked speech | we'll tick off tabooed subjects and make an index expurgatorius and then we'll get on famously |  no need of that he said |  as far as i am concerned please consider me fair game |  consider you fair game | she said with her head archly on one side |  that would be arrant poaching | don't fear graydon i shall never regard any man as game not even if i should become a fat dowager with a bevy of plain daughters and a dull market | grave and silent mr muir leaned back in his chair and laughed so heartily that he attracted attention at the wildmere table across the room |  that man doesn't act as if on the brink of failure thought miss wildmere |  it's all a conspiracy of arnault with papa |  you are making game of me in one sense very successfully graydon admitted laughing a little uneasily |  oh in that sense all men are legitimate game and i shall chaff as many as possible out of spite that i was not a man |  you would make a good one you are so devoid of sentiment and so independent |  and yet within a week i think a certain gentleman was inclined to think me sentimental aesthetic intense a victim of ideals and devotional rhapsodies |  oh ye gods | here waiter bring me my dessert and let me escape cried graydon |  did you say i was to be ready at five | she asked sweetly |  yes and bring down articles of a truce and we'll sign them in red ink | an hour later she heard the gallop of a horse and saw him riding away |  she shan't mount the animal he had thought till i learn more about him and give him all the running he wants to day | she has a heavy enough score against me as it is and i'll not employ another brute to make things worse | he learned more fully what he had discovered before that she would have her hands full in managing the horse and he gave him a run that covered him with foam and tested his breathing | at four he galloped back to the station to see if the saddle had arrived but found that even his skill and strength were not sufficient to make the animal approach the engine | shouting to the baggage man to bring the expected articles to the stable he was soon there and made another experiment | a hostler brought him a blanket which he strapped around his waist and mounted again in a lady's style | it was at once evident that the horse had never been ridden by a woman | he reared kicked and plunged around frightfully and graydon had to clutch the mane often to keep his seat | madge had speedily joined him and looked with absorbed interest at times laughing and again imploring graydon to dismount | this he at last he did the perspiration pouring from his face | resigning the trembling and wearied horse to a stable boy he came toward the young girl mopping his brow and exclaiming: it will never do at all | he is ugly as sin | no woman should ride him not even a squaw |  bah graydon | he did not throw you although he had you at every disadvantage | i'm not in the least afraid | has the saddle come |  yes but i protest madge | here dr sommers who was approaching lay your commands on this rash girl |  if dr sommers says i'm rash he doesn't understand my case and i refuse to employ him cried madge | then she added sweetly: if i break any bones doctor i'll be your very humble and obedient servant | it's half past four and i'll be ready as soon as you are graydon | no backing out | you might as well warn me against the peril of a rocking chair and she went to put on her habit |  heaven help us | said graydon to the doctor |  we're in a scrape | she's so resolute that i believe she would go alone | what would you do | hang it all | the people of the house have got an inkling of what's up some are gathering near and the windows are full of heads |  put the saddle on one of the quiet livery horses and you ride this brute said the doctor |  you don't know her | she wouldn't stand that at all |  then give her her head | after yesterday i believe she can do what she undertakes | you have tired the horse out pretty thoroughly and i guess she'll manage him | leaving orders to have madge's horse sponged off and dried and the best animal in the stable prepared for himself he said well then doctor be on hand to repair damages and went to his room to change his dress | the doctor did more | he saw that madge's horse was saddled carefully meanwhile admiring the beautiful equipment that graydon had ordered | he also insured that graydon had a good mount | when at last the young man tapped at madge's door she came out looking most beautiful in her close fitting habit and low beaver with its drooping feather | mary followed her protesting and half crying and mr muir looked very grave |  madge said graydon earnestly i should never forgive myself if any harm came to you | that horse is not fit for you to ride |  good people see here said madge turning upon them i am not a reckless child nor am i making a rash experiment | even if i did not fear broken bones do you think i would give you needless anxiety | graydon has kindly obtained for me a fine horse and i must make a beginning to show you and him that i can ride | if mr and mrs wayland were here they would laugh at you | don't come out to see me off mary | others would follow and i don't want to be conspicuous | i do wish people would mind their own business |  no danger of my coming out | i don't want to see you break your neck cried mary re entering her room |  you must let me go madge said mr muir firmly |  i may have to interpose my authority |  yes do come for heaven's sake | said graydon |  very well laughed madge |  if i once get on you and the horse may both find it hard to get me off | where are the horses | she asked upon reaching the door |  you must yield one point and mount near the stable said graydon resolutely |  oh certainly i'll yield everything except my ride | madge's horse stood pawing the ground showing how obdurate and untamable was his spirit | she exclaimed at the beauty of the saddle and its housings and said thank you graydon so charmingly that he anathematized himself for giving her a brute instead of a horse |  i should have satisfied myself better about him he thought and have looked further | in a moment she had the animal by the head and was patting his neck while he turned an eye of fire down upon her and showed no relenting in his chafed and excited mood | graydon meanwhile examined everything carefully and saw that the bridle had a powerful curb |  well said he ruefully if you will you will |  yes in no other way can i satisfy you was her quiet reply |  let us get away then spectators are gathering | you should be able to hold him with this rein |come  she put her foot in his hand and was mounted in a second the reins well in hand | the horse reared but a sharp downward pull to the right brought him to his feet again | then he plunged and kicked but she sat as if a part of him meanwhile speaking to him in firm gentle tones | his next unexpected freak was to run backward in a way that sent the neighboring group flying | instantly madge gave him a stinging blow over the hind quarters and he fairly sprang into the air |  get off madge cried mr muir authoritatively but the horse was speeding down the road toward the house and graydon who had looked on breathlessly followed | before they reached the hotel she had brought him up with the powerful curb and prancing curvetting straining side wise first in one direction then in the other meanwhile trembling half with anger half with terror the mastered brute passed the piazza with its admiring groups | graydon was at her side | he did not see miss wildmere frowning with vexation and envy or arnault's complacent observance | with sternly compressed lips and steady eye he watched madge that whatever emergency occurred he might do all that was possible | the young girl herself was a presence not soon to be forgotten | her lips were slightly parted her eye glowing with a joyous sense of power and her pose flexible to the eccentric motions of the horse grace itself | they passed on down the winding carriage drive out upon the main street and then she turned waved her handkerchief to mr muir and with her companion galloped away | several of mr muir's acquaintances came forward offering congratulations which he accepted with his quiet smile and then went up to reassure his wife who in spite of her words to the contrary had kept her eyes fastened upon madge as long as she was in sight |  well she exclaimed did you ever see anything equal to that |  no said her husband but i have seen nothing wonderful or unnatural she did not do a thing that she had not been trained and taught to do and all her acts were familiar by much usage |  i think she's a prodigy exclaimed mrs muir |  nothing of the kind | she is a handsome girl with good abilities who has had the sense to make the most and best of herself instead of dawdling | after an easy gallop of a mile in which madge showed complete power to keep her horse from breaking into a mad run she drew rein and looked at graydon with a smile | he took off his hat and bowed laughingly |  oh graydon she said it was nice of you to let me have my own way |  i didn't do it very graciously | i have seldom been more worried in my life |  i'm glad you were a little worried she said |  it recalls your look and tone at the time of our parting when you said 'oh madge do get well and strong '| haven't i complied with your wish |  had my wish anything to do with your compliance |  why not |  what an idiot i've been | i fear i have been misjudging you absurdly | i've had no end of ridiculous thoughts and theories about you | indeed  apparently i had slight place in your thoughts at all but i made great allowances for a man in your condition |  that was kind but you were mistaken | why madge we were almost brought up together and i couldn't reconcile the past and the present | the years you spent in the far west and their result are more wonderful than a fairytale | i wish you would tell me about them |  i will | friends should be reasonably frank | what's more i wish to show you how natural and probable the result as you call it has been | your wondering perplexity vexes me | you know what i was when we parted |  no i don't believe i do or you couldn't be what you are now |  well i can tell you: i had weak lungs a weak body and a weak uncultured mind | i was weak in all respects but i discovered that i had a will and i had sense enough as henry says to know that if i was ever going to be more than a ghost it was time i set about it | i knew of mrs wayland's restoration to health in the climate of santa barbara and i determined to try it myself | i couldn't have had better friends or advantages than the place afforded | but oh graydon i was so weak and used up when i reached there that i could scarcely do more than breathe | but i had made up my mind either to get well or to die | i rested for days until i could make a beginning and then one step at a time as it were i went forward | take two things that you have seen me do for example | one can bathe in the sea at santa barbara almost throughout the year | at first i was as timid as a child and scarcely dared to wet my feet but mr wayland was a sensible instructor and led me step by step | the water was usually still and i gradually acquired the absolute confidence of one who can swim and swims almost every day | so with a horse | i could hardly sit on one that was standing still i was so weak and frightened but with muscle and health came stronger nerves and higher courage | after a few months i thought nothing of a ten mile gallop on the beach or out to the ca ons | i took up music in the same way and had a thoroughly good teacher | he did the best he could for me which wasn't so very much | i never could become a scientist in anything but i was determined to be no sham within my limitations | i have tried to do some things as well as i could and let the rest go | now you see how easily i can explain myself and i only seem wonderful because of contrast with what i was |  but where do i come in | he asked eagerly |  did you not say 'please get well and strong '| i thought it would gratify you and mary and henry | you used to call me a ghost and i did not want to be a ghost any longer | i saw that you enjoyed your vigorous life fully and felt that i might enjoy life also and as i grew strong i did enjoy everything more and more | two things besides and i can say 'all present or accounted for '| mr wayland is a student and has a splendid library | he coached me that was your old college jargon on books and mrs wayland coached me on society | so here i am weighing a hundred and twenty pounds more or less and ready for another gallop and away she went the embodiment of beautiful life |  one more question madge he said as they slackened pace again |  why wouldn't you write to me oftener |  i don't like to write letters | mine to mary were scarcely more than notes | ask her | are you satisfied now | am i a sphinx a conundrum any longer |  no and at last i am more than content that you are not little madge |  why this is famous as dr sommers says | when was a man ever known to change his mind before |  i've changed mine so often of late that i'm fairly dizzy | you are setting me straight at last | madge laughed outright and after a moment said now account for yourself | what places did you visit abroad | he began to tell her and she to ask questions that surprised him showing that she had some idea of even the topography and color of the region and a better knowledge of the history and antiquities than himself | at last he expressed his wonder |  what nonsense | she exclaimed |  you don't remember the little i did write you | as i said before did you not at my request very kindly and liberally too graydon send me books about the places you expected to see | a child could have read them and so have gained the information that surprises you | they talked on one thing leading to another until he had a conscious glow of mental excitement | she knew so much that he knew only in a different way and her thoughts came rippling forth in piquant musical words | her eyes were so often full of laughter that he saw that she was happy and he remembered after their return that she had not said an ill natured word about any one | it was another of their old time breezy talks only larger fuller complete with her rich womanhood | he found himself alive in every fibre of his body and faculty of his mind | as they turned homeward the evening shadows were gathering and at last the dusky twilight passed into a soft radiance under the rays of the full orbed moon | i don't know why | perhaps it is to complete our view of the congregation since during the rest of the time we look the other way and unless we faced about should see only half | i like to peep at father to discover whether he appreciates the performance | to day he just turned his head away | mother sat down | aunt clara looked straight ahead and her old fashioned bonnet hid her face but i could discover that something more than usual was working under her cap | i looked at every one of the singers and then at the players from the big bass viol down to the tenor and not a bit of reason could i perceive for the twitter the heads of our pew had certainly got themselves into | there's a pattern old lady prudence clark presidentess of the dorcas society a spinster just aunt clara's age a woman who knows everything and more too | she sits in the pew before us | she turned her head and gave a sly peep at aunt clara | they both laughed in meeting | i know they did and they can't deny it | i peeped round at the minister and if he did not laugh too his face was scarlet and he was taken with a wonderful fit of coughing | such strange proceedings in meeting i never had seen | the minister the deacon father is a deacon and the oldest members were setting us young folks a very bad example | but we tolerate anything in our good old parson | he was a youth when our old folks were young and as to us young folks he remembers us longer than we do ourselves |  we were all home and tea was over the early tea with substantials as is the custom in the primitive districts of new england on sunday afternoon | the double accumulation of dishes was disposed of for at noon we take a cold collation doughnuts and cheese and bread and butter and we never descend to servile employments till after tea | then many hands make light work | i suppose light work does not break the sabbath especially as it is done in our sunday best with sleeves tucked up and an extra apron | the laughing in church was the point upon which as yet we had obtained no satisfaction | jerusha and i in an uncertain hope that we should find out something in due time were discussing the music | the particular point in debate was why village choirs will astonish the people with pieces of music in which nobody can join them | we did not settle it nor has anybody ever solved the riddle that i know of | we don't even know whether it comes under the ontological or psychological departments |  there now | haven't i brought in the famous words that our new schoolmaster astonished us with at the teachers' meeting | he need not think that webster unabridged is his particular field in which nobody else may hunt | we were as i said discussing the music | mother was flitting round giving the final dust off and brush about after our early tea | aunt clara was sitting quietly at the window pretending to read baxter's saint's rest | jerusha and i tried to imitate the tune and we did it as well as we could and i am sure we are not bad singers | mother slipped out of the room just as we came to and vie with gabriel while he sings | she ran as if something had stung her and she was making for the hartshorn or some fresh brook mud | aunt clara's face laughed all over and i said: come now aunt clara you are really irreverent | you began laughing in meeting and you are keeping it up over that good book |  downright wicked said jerusha | she dreaded the latter's pride the resolute selfishness of his scheme of life which would lead him to drop her should she interfere with it | she was learning to dread even more graydon's high toned sense of honor the final decisions he reached from motives which had slight influence with her | what if she should permit both men to slip from her grasp while she hesitated | she fairly turned cold with horror at the thought of this and of the poverty which might result | thus from widely differing motives two girls were sighing for time and graydon muir strong confident proud of his knowledge of society and ability to take care of himself was walking blindly on the victim of one woman's guile the object of another woman's pure unselfish love and liable at any hour to be blasted for life by the fulfilment of his hope and the consummation of his happiness | sweet madge alden hiding your infinite treasure deceiving all and yet so true may you have time | chapter xxi suggestive tones miss wildmere had promised to drive with graydon on the following morning but madge felt as if heaven had interfered in her behalf for the skies were clouded and the rain fell unceasingly | people were at a loss to beguile the hours | graydon miss wildmere and mr arnault played pool together while mr muir his wife and madge bowled for an hour the last winning most of the games | mr arnault had a certain rude sense of fair play and it appeared to him that graydon's course had become all that he could ask more than he could naturally expect | the lady was apparently left wholly free to make her choice between them and all protest even by manner against her companionship with him had ceased | he could drive walk or dance with her at his will then graydon would quietly put in an appearance and make the most of his opportunity | arnault was not deceived however | he knew that his present rival was the most dangerous one that he had ever encountered that stella might accept him at any time and was much inclined to do so speedily | indeed he was about driven to the belief that she would do so at once but for the fear that the muirs were in financial peril | he hoped that this fear and the pressure of her father's need might lead her to decide in his favor without the necessity of his being the immediate and active agent in breaking down the muirs | as a business man he shrunk from this course and all the more because graydon was acting so fairly | nevertheless he would play his principal card if he must | it was his nature to win in every game of life and it had become a passion with him to secure the beautiful girl that he had sought so long and vainly | if it could appear to the world that he had fairly won her he would not scruple at anything in the accomplishment of his purpose and would feel that he had scored the most brilliant success in his life | if he could do this without ruining them he would be glad and his good will was enhanced by graydon's course this morning | the former had sauntered into the billiard room but seeing graydon with miss wildmere had been about to depart when muir had said cordially come arnault take a cue with us and had quite disarmed him by frank courtesy | at last the sound of music and laughter lured them to the main hall and there they found madge surrounded by children and young people little nellie wilder clinging to her side the most closely with mr and mrs wilder looking at the young girl with a world of grateful good will in their eyes |  oh miss alden sing us another song clamored a dozen voices |  yes cried jennie muir the funny one you sang for us in the woods | madge smilingly complied and the children fairly danced in their delight at the comical strains abrupt pauses droll sentiment and interlarded words of explanation | the more elderly guests were attracted and the audience grew apace | having finished her little musical comedy madge arose and mr arnault aware of stella wildmere's ability to sing selections from opera said since the children have been so well entertained i suggest that we who have the misfortune to be grown have our turn and that miss wildmere give us some grown up music | madge flushed slightly and miss wildmere after a little charming hesitation seated herself at the piano and sang almost faultlessly a selection from an opera | it was evident that she had been well and carefully trained and that within her limitations which she thoughtfully remembered she gave little occasion for criticism | both her suitors were delighted | they applauded so heartily and urged so earnestly with others that she sang again and again to the unaffected pleasure of the throng who had now gathered | at last she pleaded fatigue and rose from the instrument flushing proudly amid vociferous encores | graydon was about to ask madge to sing again when an old gentleman who had listened to the children's ditties and had detected unusual sweetness and power in madge's tones said promptly i may be mistaken but i have an impression that miss alden can give us some grown up music if she will | instantly his suggestion was seconded by general entreaty in which not only graydon joined from sincere good will but also mr arnault in the hope of giving stella a triumph for he believed that the best her social rival could do would be to render some ballad fairly well | madge's brow contracted as though she were irresolute and troubled |  truly miss alden said stella who was standing near i have done my part to beguile the dismal day i think you might favor us also | there are no critics here i hope | we should enjoy a simple song if you cannot now recall anything else |  very well then i will give you a little german song that my old teacher loved well but graydon saw the same slight flush and a resolute expression take the place of her hesitancy | after a brief prelude which to his trained ear revealed her perfect touch her voice rose with a sweet resonant power that held those near spellbound and swelled in volume until people in distant parts of the house paused and listened as if held by a viewless hand | connoisseurs felt that they were listening to an artist and not an amateur plain men and women and the children knew simply that they were enjoying music that entranced them that set their nerves thrilling and vibrating | madge hoped only that her voice might penetrate the barriers between herself and one man's heart | she did not desire to sing on the present occasion | she did not wish to annoy him by the contrast between her song and miss wildmere's performance feeling that he would naturally take sides in his thoughts with the woman outvied nor had she any desire to inflict upon her rival the disparagement that must follow but something in miss wildmere's self satisfied and patronizing tone had touched her quick spirit and the arrogant girl should receive the lesson she had invited | but as madge sang the noble art soon lifted her above all lower thoughts and she forgot everything but graydon and the hope of her heart | she sang for him alone as she had learned to sing for him alone | in spite of her explanations he looked at her with the same old wonder and perplexity of which he had been conscious from the first | if she had merely sung with correctness and taste like miss wildmere there would have been nothing to disturb his complacent admiration but now he almost felt like springing to her side with the words what is it madge | tell me all | as the last lovely notes ceased only the unthinking children applauded | from the others there was entreaty |  please sing again miss alden said the gentleman who had first asked her |  i am an old man and can't hope for many more such rich pleasures | i am not an amateur and know only the music that reaches my heart |  sing something from 'lohengrin ' madge said henry muir quietly | she glanced at him and there was a humorous twinkle in his eyes | herr brachmann had trained her thoroughly in some of wagner's difficult music and she gave them a selection which so far surpassed the easy melodies of verdi which miss wildmere had sung that the latter sat pale and incensed yet not daring to show her chagrin | this music was received with unbounded applause and then a little voice piped the big folks have had more'n their turn now give us a reg'lar mother goose | this request was received with acclamations and soon ripples of laughter broke over the crowd in all directions and then one of the adoring boys who were usually worshipping near cried out a reel miss alden a reel and let us finish up with a high old dance before dinner | graydon seized miss wildmere's hand boys made profound bows to their mothers husbands dragged their protesting wives out upon the floor | soon nearly all ages and heights were in the two long lines many feet already keeping time to madge's rollicking strains | never had such a dance been known before in the house for the very genius and inspiration of mirth seemed to be in the piano | the people were laughing half the time at the odd medley of tunes and improvisations that madge invoked and gray bearded men indulged in some of the antics that they had thought forgotten a quarter of a century before | as the last couple at the head of the lines was glancing down the archway of raised and clasped hands the lively strains ceased and the dancers swarmed out with thanks and congratulations upon their lips only to see madge flying up the stairway |  madge said graydon at dinner i suppose you will tell me you have practiced over and over again every note you sang this morning |  certainly some of the more difficult ones hours and hours and months and months | herr brachmann was an amiable dragon in music and insisted on your knowing what you did know |  i thought you would say all this but it doesn't account for your singing |  what do you mean |  i don't know exactly | there is something you did not get from herr brachmann scarcely from nature | it suggests what artists call feeling and more |  oh every one has his own method said madge carelessly and yet with a visible increase of color |  'method ' do you call it | i'm half inclined to think that it might be akin to madness were you very unhappy | the human voice often has a strange power over me and i have a theory that it may reveal character more than people imagine | why shouldn't it | it is the chief medium of our expression and we may even unconsciously reveal ourselves in our tones |  when were you so fanciful before | what does a professional reveal |  chiefly that she is a trained professional and yet even the most blas among them give hints as to the compass of their woman nature | i think their characters are often suggested quite definitely by their tones | indeed i even find myself judging people by their voices | henry's tones indicate many of his chief traits accurately as for instance self reliance reserve quiet and unswerving purpose |  well asked mrs muir who was a little obtuse on delicate points what did miss wildmere's tones indicate | graydon was slightly taken aback and suddenly found that he did not like his theory so well as he had thought |  miss wildmere's tones he began hesitatingly suggested this morning little more than a desire to render well the music she sang and to give pleasure to her listeners |  i thought they suggested some self complacency which was lost before the morning was over added mr muir dryly |  miss wildmere sang admirably exclaimed madge warmly and could sing much better if she had been trained in a better method and gave more time to the art | i sang hours every day for nearly two years | nothing will take the place of practice graydon | one must develop voice like muscle |  you are a generous sensible critic madge he said quietly although there was a flush of resentment on his face at his brother's words |  in the main you are right but i still hold to my theory | at least i believe that in all great music there is a subtle individuality and motif | love may be blind but it is not deaf | miss wildmere gave us good music not great music | mr muir began talking about the weather as if it were the only subject in his mind and soon afterward madge went to her room with bowed head and downcast heart |  i have no chance she sighed |  he loves her and that ends all | he is loyal to her and will be loyal even though she breaks his heart eventually as i fear | it's his nature | chapter xxii disheartening confidences under a renewed impulse of loyalty graydon intercepted miss wildmere as she was going to her room and said: the clouds in the west are all breaking away they ever do you know if one has patience | we can still have our drive and enjoy it all the more from hope deferred |  i'm so sorry she began in some embarrassment |  of course i couldn't know last night that it would rain in the morning and so promised mr arnault this afternoon |  it seems as if it would ever be hope deferred to me miss wildmere he said gravely |  but graydon you must see how it is no i don't see but i yield as usual |  i promise you sunday afternoon or the first clear day she exclaimed eagerly |  very well he replied brightening |  remember i shall be a shylock with this bond | but he was irritated nevertheless and went out on the piazza to try the soothing influence of a cigar | the skies cleared rapidly | so did his brow and before long he muttered: i'll console myself by another gallop with madge | there goes my inamorata smiling upon another fellow | how long is this going to last | not all summer by jupiter | her father must not insist on her playing that game too long even though she does play it so well | madge was sitting in her room in dreary apathy and spiritless reaction from the strain of the morning when she was aroused by a knock on her door |  madge called a voice that sent the blood to her face what say you to another ride | i know the roads are muddy but but i'll go with you she cried |  why use adversatives in the same breath with 'ride' | the mud's nothing | what won't rub off can stay on | how soon shall i be ready |  that's a good live girl | in half an hour | when they were a mile or two away madge asked as if with sudden compunction graydon are you sure you were disengaged | he laughed outright |  that question comes much too late he said | she braced herself as if to receive a deadly blow and was pale and rigid with the effort as she asked with an air of curiosity merely are you truly engaged to miss wildmere graydon |  in one sense i am madge he replied gravely |  i have given her my loyalty and to a certain extent my word but i have not bound her | since you have proved so true and generous a friend to me i do not hesitate to let you know the truth | i am sorry you do not like her altogether and that you have some cause for your feeling but you are both right at heart | she spoke most enthusiastically of your rescue of the child | you ladies amuse me with your emphasis of little piques but when it comes to anything large or fine you do justice to one another | henry had no right to say what he did at dinner for stella applauded you as you had her but henry's prejudices are inveterate | why should i not be loyal to her madge | i believe she remained free for my sake during the years of my absence |  i think your feelings are very natural | they are what i should expect of you | you have always seemed to me the soul of honor when once you obtain your bearings she added with a wan smile |  how pale you are madge | he said anxiously |  i am not feeling very well to day and then i am suffering from the reaction of this morning | i never can get over my old timidity and dislike to do anything in public | i can do what i will but it often costs me dear | i was led on unexpectedly this morning | i only anticipated singing a ditty for the children when i first went to the piano at their request |  i saw that madge | any other woman with your power of song would have made it known long before this |  and believe me graydon i did not want to sing in rivalry with miss wildmere | i'm sorry i did |  i saw that too he replied laughing |  stella drew that little experience down upon herself |  i'm sorry now that i sang she said in a low tone |  i didn't want to do anything to hurt the feelings of so good a friend as you are |  you didn't hurt my feelings in the least | just the contrary | you gave much pleasure and made me all the more proud of you | it will do stella no harm to have her self complacency jostled a little | slight wonder that her head is somewhat giddy from the immense amount of attention she has received | i'm not perfect madge why should i demand perfection | it's delightful to be talking in this way like old times | i used to talk to you about stella years ago | if i have the substance i can forego the shadow and i do feel that i can say to you all that i could to a sensible and loving sister | believe me madge i can never get over my old feeling for you and i'm just as proud of you as if your name was madge muir | i think your brave effort and achievement at santa barbara simply magnificent | you have long had the affection that i would give to a sister and now that i understand you i feel for you all the respect that i could give to any woman |  those are kind generous words graydon | i knew that you misunderstood me and i was only provoked at you not angry |  you had good reason to be provoked and much more | if you and stella understood each other in the same way and well if she were only out of that atmosphere in which she has been brought up i could ask nothing more |  what atmosphere |  wall street atmosphere transferred to the domestic and social circle | you have too much delicacy madge to refer to what i know puzzles you and i admit that i do not fully understand it all though i know stella's motive clearly enough | her motive is worthy of all commendation but not her method | she is not so much to blame for this as her father and perhaps her mother who appears a weak spiritless woman a faint echo of her husband | it is here that the infernal wall street atmosphere comes in that she has breathed all her life | does it not puzzle you in view of my relations to her that she should be out driving with arnault |  yes graydon it does |  well arnault is a money lender and i am satisfied that in some way he has her father in his power | many of these brokers are like cats | they will hold on to anything by one nail and the first thing you know they are on their feet again all right | as soon as wildmere makes a lucky strike in the stock market he will extricate himself and his daughter at the same time | of course these things are not formulated in words in a cold blooded way i suppose | arnault has long been a suitor that would take no rebuff | i am satisfied that she has refused him more than once but he simply persists and gives her to understand that he will take his chances | this was the state of affairs when i came home and she no doubt feels that if she can save her father and keep a home for her mother and the little one she ought to retain her hold on arnault | after all it is not so bad | many women marry for money outright and all poor stella proposes is to be complaisant toward a man who would not continue his business support to one whose daughter had just refused him | madge was silent |  you wouldn't do such a thing i suppose |  i couldn't graydon she said simply |  if i should ever love a man i think i could suffer a great deal for his sake but there are some things i couldn't do |  i thought you would feel so |  why don't you help her father out | madge faltered |  i don't think i have sufficient means | i have never been over thrifty in saving and have not laid by many thousands | i have merely a good salary and very good prospects | you can't imagine how slow and conservative henry is | in business matters he treats me just as if i were a stranger and i must prove myself worthy of trust at every point and by long apprenticeship before he will give me a voice in affairs | he says coming forward too fast is the ruination of young men in our day | nothing would tempt him to have dealings with mr wildmere and i couldn't damage myself more than by any transactions on my own account | but even if i were rich i wouldn't interfere | i don't like her father any better than henry does and if i began in this way it would make a bad precedent | what's more i won't introduce money influences into an affair of this kind | if it comes to the point stella must decide for me ignoring all other considerations | if she does i won't permit her family to suffer but i propose to know that she chooses me absolutely in spite of everything | i am also resolved that she shall be separated from her family as far as is right for there is a tone about them that i don't like |  i thank you for your confidence graydon said madge quietly |  you are acting just as i should suppose you would | no one in the world wishes you happiness more earnestly than i do | come let us take this level place like the wind | she was unusually gay during the remainder of their ride but seemed bent almost on running her horse to death |  to morrow is sunday she explained and i must crowd two rides into one |  wouldn't you ride to morrow |  no i have some old fashioned notions about sunday | you have been abroad too long perhaps to appreciate them |  i appreciate fidelity to conscience madge | they had their supper together again as on the evening before but madge was carelessly languid and fitful in her mirthful sallies and complained of over fatigue |  i won't come down again to night she said to graydon as they passed out of the supper room |  good night |  good night madge he replied taking her hand in both his own |  i understand you now and know that you have gone beyond even your superb strength to day | sleep the sleep of the justest and truest little woman that ever breathed | i can't tell you how much you have added to my happiness during the past two days |  he understands me | she muttered as she closed the door of her room |  i am almost tempted to doubt whether a merciful god understands me | why was this immeasurable love put into my heart to be so cruelly thwarted | why must he go blindly on to so cruel a fate | of course she'll renounce everything for him | whatever else she may be she is not an idiot | henry muir's quiet eyes had observed madge closely and from a little distance he had seen the parting between her and his brother | then he saw graydon seek miss wildmere and resume a manner which he had learned to detest and the self contained man went out upon the grounds and said through clinched teeth: to think that there should have been such a fool bearing the name of muir | he's been gushing to madge about that speculator and we shall yet have to take her as we would an infection | chapter xxiii the filial martyr miss wildmere appeared in one of her most brilliant moods that evening | there was a dash of excitement almost recklessness in her gray eyes | she and mr arnault had been deputed to lead the german but she took graydon out so often as to produce in mr arnault's eyes an expression which the observant mr wildmere did not like at all | he had just returned from dreary half deserted wall street which was as dead and hopeless as only that region of galvanic life can be at times | he had neither sold nor bought stock but had moused around with the skill of an old habitu for information concerning the eligibility of the two men who were seeking his daughter's hand | in the midsummer dullness and holiday stagnation the impending operation in the catskills was the only one that promised anything whatever | he became more fully satisfied that arnault's firm was prospering | they had been persistent bears on a market that had long been declining and had reaped a golden harvest from the miseries of others | on the other hand he learned that henry muir was barely holding his own and that he had strained his credit dangerously to do this | he knew about the enterprise which had absorbed the banker's capital and while he believed it would respond promptly to the returning flow of the financial tide it now seemed stranded among more hopeless ventures | there was no escaping the conviction that muir was in a perilous position and that a little thing might push him over the brink | therefore he had returned fully beat upon using all his influence in behalf of arnault and was spurred to this effort by the fact that his finances but not his expenses were running low | his wife could give but a dubious account of stella's conduct |  in short said mr wildmere irritably she is dallying with both and may lose both by her hesitating folly | his daughter's greeting was brief and formal | a sort of matter of course kiss had been given and then he had been left to eat his supper alone since his wife could not just then be absent from her child | at last he lounged out on the piazza sat down before one of the parlor windows glanced at the gay scene within and smoked in silence | before the german began graydon passed him several times regarding him curiously and with a growing sense of repulsion | he disliked to think that the relation between this man and the girl he would marry was so close | before the evening was over mr wildmere saw that his daughter was in truth pursuing a difficult policy | the angry light in arnault's eyes and the grave expression on graydon's face proved how fraught with peril it was to his hopes | neither of her suitors liked stella's manner that evening for it suggested traits which promised ill for the future | graydon who understood her the less was the more lenient judge |  not only arnault he thought but her father also has been pressing her toward a course from which she revolts and she is half reckless in consequence | he endeavored by his quiet and observant attention by the grave and gentle expression of his eyes to assure her once more that she could find a refuge in him the moment that she would decide absolutely in his favor | she understood him well and was enraged that she could not that night go out with him into the moonlight put her hand in his and end her suspense | her father had whispered significantly when they met stella i must see you before you give mr muir further encouragement and she feeling that it might be among her last chances for the present of showing graydon favor was lavish of it | but it was not the preference of strong true womanly choice it was rather the half defiant aspect with which forbidden fruit might be regarded | as the great clock was about to chime the hour of midnight the dancing ceased | arnault seemed determined to have the last word and graydon interposed no obstacle | the former walked on the piazza by stella's side for a few turns in moody silence | her father still sat at his post of observation | mrs wildmere had been with him part of the time but he had not had much to say to her |  mr arnault said stella satirically at last i will not tax your remarkable power for entertainment any longer | i will now join papa and retire |  very well stella was the quiet reply but before we part i shall speak more to the point than if i had talked hours | by this time another week the question must be decided | she bowed and made no other answer |  stella said her father when they were alone and he had regarded for some moments her averted and half sullen face what do you propose to do | there was no answer | after another pause he continued: in settling the question represent your mother and myself by a cipher | that is all we are if the logic of your past action counts for anything | again i ask what do you propose to do | no matter how pretty and flattered a girl may be she cannot alter gravitation | there are other facts just as inexorable | shutting your eyes to them or any other phase of folly will not make the slightest difference |  i think it's a horrid fact that i must marry a man that i don't love |  that is not one of the facts at all | stock gambler as i am and in almost desperate straits i require nothing of the kind | knowing you as i do i advise you to accept arnault at once but i do not demand it i do not even urge it | if you loved me if you would say 'give up this feverish life of risk i will help you and suffer with you in your poverty i will marry graydon muir and share his poverty ' i would leave wall street at once and forever | it's a maelstrom in which men of my calibre and means are sucked down sooner or later | the prospects now are that it will be sooner unless i am helped through this crisis |  i believe you are mistaken about the muirs being in financial danger |  i am not mistaken | they may have to suspend daring the coming week |  i know that graydon muir has no suspicion of trouble |  he is but a clerk in his brother's employ and has just returned from a long absence | mr muir is one of the most reticent of men | i have invested in the same dead stock that is swamping him and so know whereof i speak | should this stock decline further should it even remain where it is much longer he can't maintain himself | i know for i have taken pains to obtain information since i last went to town |  but if the stock rises she said with the natural hope of a speculator's daughter he is safe |  yes if |  how much time will you give me | she asked the lines of her face growing hard and resolute |  this is to be your choice not mine said her father coldly |  you shall not be able to say that i sold you or tried to sell you | of course it would be terribly hard for me to lose my footing and fall and i feel that i should not rise again | arnault worships success and worldly prestige | you are a part of his ambitious scheme | if you helped him parry it out he would do almost anything you wished and he could throw business enough in my way to put me speedily on my feet | you must make your choice in view of the following facts: you can go on living here just as you are two or three weeks longer dallying with opportunity | by that time unless i get relief and help i shall reach the end of my resources and creditors will take everything | the muirs cannot help me and i don't believe they would in any event | i am not on good terms with henry muir | if they go down now they will be thoroughly cleaned out | arnault has long been devoted to you and you could have unbounded influence over him if you acted in the line of his ruling passion | it would gratify his pride and add to the world's good opinion of him if i prospered also | in plain english we may all be in a tenement house in a month or i on safe ground and you the affianced wife of a rich man |  well said stella coldly you have given me facts enough | it's a pity you couldn't have brought me something better from wall street after all these years |  what have you brought to me during these past years he demanded sternly but constant requests for money and the necessity for incessant effort to meet new phases of extravagance | you have not asked what was kind merciful and true but what was the latest style | few days pass but that i am reminded of you by a bill for some frippery or other but how often am i reminded of you by acts of filial thoughtfulness by words of sympathy in my hard battle of life when i am present or by genial letters when absent | i have spent three hot days in the city seeking chiefly your interest and a more mechanical perfunctory thing never existed than your kiss of greeting to night | there was as much feeling in it as in the quarter that i handed to the stage driver | i have spent thousands on your education but you don't sing for me you don't read to me you never think of soothing my overtaxed nerves by cheerful hopeful talk | were i a steel automaton supplying your wants i should answer just as well and in that case you might remember the laws of matter and apply a little oil occasionally | what are the motives of your life but dress admiration excitement a rapid succession of men to pass under your baleful fascination and then to pass on crippled in soul for having known you | unless you can give graydon muir a loving woman's heart and mean to cling to him for worse as well as better you will commit a crime before god and man if you accept him | with arnault it is different | in mind you are near enough of kin to marry | as long as you complied with fashionable and worldly proprieties he would be content but a man with a heart and soul in his body would perish in the desert of a home that your selfishness would create |  it's awful for you to talk to me in this way | she whined wincing and crying under his arraignment |  it's awful that i have to speak to you in this way either to make you realize what deformities your beauty hides so that you may apply the remedy or else if you will not to promote your union with a man content to take for a wife a belle and not a woman |  i suppose i am chiefly to blame though or you would be different he added with a dark introspective look |  i was proud of you as a beautiful child and tried to win your love by indulgence | heaven knows i would like to be a different man but it's all a breathless hurry after bubbles that vanish when grasped | well what do you propose to do | you see that you can't hesitate much longer |  i will decide soon she answered sullenly | although her conscience echoed his words and she felt their justice her pride prevailed and she permitted him to depart without another word | chapter xxiv i'll see how you behave the dawn of the following sacred day was bright beautiful and serene bringing to the world a new wealth of opportunity | miss wildmere began its hours depressed and undecided | her conscience and better angel were pleading she felt vaguely that her life and its motives were wrong and was uncomfortable over the consciousness | her phase of character however was one of the most hopeless | it was true that her vanity had grown to the proportions of a disease but even this might be overcome | her father's stern words had wounded it terribly and she had experienced twinges of self disgust | but another trait had become inwrought by long habit with every fibre of her soul selfishness | it was almost impossible to give up her own way and wishes | graydon muir pleased her fancy and she was bent on marrying him | her father's assurance that she would bring him disappointment not happiness weighed little | too many men had told her that she was essential to their happiness to permit qualms on this score | her conscience did shrink to some extent from a loveless business like marriage and her preference for graydon made such a union all the more repugnant but she was incapable of feeling that she would do him a wrong by giving him the pretty jewelled hand for which so many had asked | indeed the question now was could she be so self sacrificing as to think of it under the circumstances | if that stock would only rise if in some way she could be assured that the muirs would be sustained and so pass on to the wealth sure to flow in upon them in prosperous times she would decide the question at once whether they would do anything for her father or not | he could scramble on in some way as he had done in the past | what she desired most was the assurance that there should be no long and doubtful interregnum of poverty and privation that she might continue to be a queen in society during the period of youth and beauty | this remained the chief consideration amid the chaos of her conflicting feelings and interests for she had lived this life so long that she could imagine no other as endurable | she had moreover the persistence of a small nature and longed to humiliate the muir pride and to spite madge alden who she half believed cherished more than a sisterly regard for graydon | as for her father she did little more than resent his words and the humiliating disquietude they had caused | they had sorely wounded her vanity and presented a painful alternative | as the day passed and old habits of mind resumed sway she began to concentrate her thoughts on three questions: should she accept graydon and take her chances with him | should she accept mr arnault with his wealth and be safe | or should she hesitate a little longer in the hope that she could secure graydon and wealth also | the persistence of a will that had always had its own way decided finally in favor of the last course of action | she would not give graydon up unless she must and not until she must | accustomed to consult self interest she believed that her father was doing the same that he was favoring arnault because the latter would be more useful to him and that for this reason he was exaggerating the muirs' peril if not inventing it | she dismissed his words about leaving wall street with scarcely a thought he always talked in this way when the times were bad or his ventures unlucky | they had been on the eve of ruin so many times that the cry of wolf was not so alarming as formerly |  i suppose i must decide before this week is over she thought |  arnault has practically given me this length of time and i shall take him at his word | therefore she was very sweet to him during the morning hours and prepared him to submit to her drive with graydon in the afternoon | arnault felt that he had given his ultimatum and was resolved to abide by it | at the same time he knew that it would be a terrible wrench to give up the girl | the very difficulty of winning her had stimulated to the utmost his passion for attainment | she was the best that existed in his superficial world and fulfilled his ideal | her delicate yet somewhat voluptuous beauty completely intoxicated him | he too thought and made his decision during the day | if he won her at all it must be speedily and it should be done by promises of devotion and wealth if possible and by breaking the muirs down if this should become necessary | the time had come for decisive action | it was evident that her father was in sore straits the man's appearance confirmed this belief | arnault was almost certain that henry muir was in his power | he would not play the latter card unless he must but he would watch so vigilantly as to be promptly aware of the necessity | he decided to spend several days of the present week in the mountains and so keep himself informed how the game went here and while in the city he would not only be observant but would also drop a few words to weaken mr muir's credit | one thing however was settled the problematical issue of his matrimonial scheme must soon be made known and he rather relished its congenial elements of speculative uncertainty being conscious that so much depended upon his skill and power to pull unseen wires | seeing that arnault was at miss wildmere's side graydon accompanied his relatives to church and soon found himself looking over the same hymn book with madge | the choir were present and she now merely delighted graydon with her rich alto and so rich and true was it that he often felt his nerves thrilling at her tones | he did not become absorbed in the service or sermon but thought a little wonderingly: here is a faith ever finding expression all over the world while i ignore it | how much truth does it represent | it's evidently a reality to madge although she makes so little parade of the fact | i don't believe she would do anything contrary to its teachings as she understands them | we men may think what we please but we have confidence in a woman who looks as she does now | she is not in the least inclined to devotional rhapsodies or to subserviency to priestcraft like so many women abroad | she merely appears to recognize a divine power as she accepts nature only more reverently and consciously | i suppose i am an agnostic as much as anything yet i should only be too glad to have stella at my side with such an expression on her face | i wonder if she will go with me this afternoon | i will submit to this diplomacy a few days longer and shall then end the matter | there is an increasing revulsion of my whole being from such tactics in my future wife | 'she has too much poetry in her too much good sense her nature is the essence of all that's romantic | i can't help saying it though she has treated me cruelly '| 'she has good looks certainly | i'll own to that | as for her romance and good feeling that i leave to you | i think she has treated you no more cruelly as you call it than she has me come to that '| 'she told me she would give me an answer in a month ' said ladywell emotionally | 'so she told me ' said neigh | 'and so she told him ' said ladywell | 'and i have no doubt she will keep her word to him in her usual precise manner '| 'but see what she implied to me | i distinctly understood from her that the answer would be favourable '| 'so did i '| 'so does he '| 'and he is sure to be the one who gets it since only one of us can | well i wouldn't marry her for love money nor ' 'offspring '| 'exactly: i would not |  i'll give you an answer in a month to all three of us | for god's sake let's sit down here and have something to drink '| they drew up a couple of chairs to one of the tables of a wine shop close by and shouted to the waiter with the vigour of persons going to the dogs | here behind the horizontal headed trees that dotted this part of the quay they sat over their bottles denouncing womankind till the sun got low down upon the river and the houses on the further side began to be toned by a blue mist | at last they rose from their seats and departed neigh to dine and consider his route and ladywell to take the train for dieppe | while these incidents had been in progress the two workmen had found their way into the hotel where ethelberta was staying | passing through the entrance they stood at gaze in the court much perplexed as to the door to be made for the difficulty was solved by the appearance of cornelia who in expectation of them had been for the last half hour leaning over the sill of her bed room window which looked into the interior amusing herself by watching the movements to and fro in the court beneath | after conversing awhile in undertones as if they had no real right there at all cornelia told them she would call their sister if an old gentleman who had been to see her were gone again | cornelia then ran away and sol and dan stood aloof till they had seen the old gentleman alluded to go to the door and drive off shortly after which ethelberta ran down to meet them | 'whatever have you got as your luggage '| she said after hearing a few words about their journey and looking at a curious object like a huge extended accordion with bellows of gorgeous patterned carpeting | 'well i thought to myself ' said sol ''tis a terrible bother about carrying our things | so what did i do but turn to and make a carpet bag that would hold all mine and dan's too | this you see berta is a deal top and bottom out of three quarter stuff stained and varnished | well then you see i've got carpet sides tacked on with these brass nails which make it look very handsome and so when my bag is empty 'twill shut up and be only a couple of boards under yer arm and when 'tis open it will hold a'most anything you like to put in it | that portmantle didn't cost more than three half crowns altogether and ten pound wouldn't ha' got anything so strong from a portmantle maker would it dan '| 'well no '| 'and then you see berta ' sol continued in the same earnest tone and further exhibiting the article 'i've made this trap door in the top with hinges and padlock complete so that ' 'i am afraid it is tiring you after your journey to explain all this to me ' said ethelberta gently noticing that a few gallic smilers were gathering round | 'aunt has found a nice room for you at the top of the staircase in that corner escalier d you'll see painted at the bottom and when you have been up come across to me at number thirty four on this side and we'll talk about everything '| 'look here sol ' said dan who had left his brother and gone on to the stairs | 'what a rum staircase the treads all in little blocks and painted chocolate as i am alive '| 'i am afraid i shall not be able to go on to paris with you after all ' ethelberta continued to sol | 'something has just happened which makes it desirable for me to return at once to england | but i will write a list of all you are to see and where you are to go so that it will make little difference i hope '| ten minutes before this time ethelberta had been frankly and earnestly asked by lord mountclere to become his bride not only so but he pressed her to consent to have the ceremony performed before they returned to england | ethelberta had unquestionably been much surprised and barring the fact that the viscount was somewhat ancient in comparison with herself the temptation to close with his offer was strong and would have been felt as such by any woman in the position of ethelberta now a little reckless by stress of circumstances and tinged with a bitterness of spirit against herself and the world generally | but she was experienced enough to know what heaviness might result from a hasty marriage entered into with a mind full of concealments and suppressions which if told were likely to stop the marriage altogether and after trying to bring herself to speak of her family and situation to lord mountclere as he stood a certain caution triumphed and she concluded that it would be better to postpone her reply till she could consider which of two courses it would be advisable to adopt to write and explain to him or to explain nothing and refuse him | the third course to explain nothing and hasten the wedding she rejected without hesitation | with a pervading sense of her own obligations in forming this compact it did not occur to her to ask if lord mountclere might not have duties of explanation equally with herself though bearing rather on the moral than the social aspects of the case | her resolution not to go on to paris was formed simply because lord mountclere himself was proceeding in that direction which might lead to other unseemly rencounters with him had she too persevered in her journey | she accordingly gave sol and dan directions for their guidance to paris and back starting herself with cornelia the next day to return again to knollsea and to decide finally and for ever what to do in the vexed question at present agitating her | never before in her life had she treated marriage in such a terribly cool and cynical spirit as she had done that day she was almost frightened at herself in thinking of it | how far any known system of ethics might excuse her on the score of those curious pressures which had been brought to bear upon her life or whether it could excuse her at all she had no spirit to inquire | english society appeared a gloomy concretion enough to abide in as she contemplated it on this journey home yet since its gloominess was less an essential quality than an accident of her point of view that point of view she had determined to change | there lay open to her two directions in which to move | she might annex herself to the easy going high by wedding an old nobleman or she might join for good and all the easy going low by plunging back to the level of her family giving up all her ambitions for them settling as the wife of a provincial music master named julian with a little shop of fiddles and flutes a couple of old pianos a few sheets of stale music pinned to a string and a narrow back parlour wherein she would wait for the phenomenon of a customer | and each of these divergent grooves had its fascinations till she reflected with regard to the first that even though she were a legal and indisputable lady mountclere she might be despised by my lord's circle and left lone and lorn | the intermediate path of accepting neigh or ladywell had no more attractions for her taste than the fact of disappointing them had qualms for her conscience and how few these were may be inferred from her opinion true or false that two words about the spigot on her escutcheon would sweep her lovers' affections to the antipodes | she had now and then imagined that her previous intermarriage with the petherwin family might efface much besides her surname but experience proved that the having been wife for a few weeks to a minor who died in his father's lifetime did not weave such a tissue of glory about her course as would resist a speedy undoing by startling confessions on her station before her marriage and her environments now |36  the house in town returning by way of knollsea where she remained a week or two ethelberta appeared one evening at the end of september before her house in exonbury crescent accompanied by a pair of cabs with the children and luggage but picotee was left at knollsea for reasons which ethelberta explained when the family assembled in conclave | her father was there and began telling her of a surprising change in menlove an unasked for concession to their cause and a vow of secrecy which he could not account for unless any friend of ethelberta's had bribed her | 'o no that cannot be ' said she | any influence of lord mountclere to that effect was the last thing that could enter her thoughts | 'however what menlove does makes little difference to me now '| and she proceeded to state that she had almost come to a decision which would entirely alter their way of living | 'i hope it will not be of the sort your last decision was ' said her mother | 'no quite the reverse | i shall not live here in state any longer | we will let the house throughout as lodgings while it is ours and you and the girls must manage it | i will retire from the scene altogether and stay for the winter at knollsea with picotee | i want to consider my plans for next year and i would rather be away from town | picotee is left there and i return in two days with the books and papers i require '| 'what are your plans to be '| 'i am going to be a schoolmistress i think i am '| 'a schoolmistress '|'yes  and picotee returns to the same occupation which she ought never to have forsaken | we are going to study arithmetic and geography until christmas then i shall send her adrift to finish her term as pupil teacher while i go into a training school | by the time i have to give up this house i shall just have got a little country school '| 'but ' said her mother aghast 'why not write more poems and sell 'em '| 'why not be a governess as you were '| said her father | 'why not go on with your tales at mayfair hall '| said gwendoline | 'i'll answer as well as i can | i have decided to give up romancing because i cannot think of any more that pleases me | i have been trying at knollsea for a fortnight and it is no use | i will never be a governess again: i would rather be a servant | if i am a schoolmistress i shall be entirely free from all contact with the great which is what i desire for i hate them and am getting almost as revolutionary as sol | father i cannot endure this kind of existence any longer i sleep at night as if i had committed a murder: i start up and see processions of people audiences battalions of lovers obtained under false pretences all denouncing me with the finger of ridicule | mother's suggestion about my marrying i followed out as far as dogged resolution would carry me but during my journey here i have broken down for i don't want to marry a second time among people who would regard me as an upstart or intruder | i am sick of ambition | my only longing now is to fly from society altogether and go to any hovel on earth where i could be at peace '| 'what has anybody been insulting you '| said mrs chickerel | 'yes or rather i sometimes think he may have: that is if a proposal of marriage is only removed from being a proposal of a very different kind by an accident '| 'a proposal of marriage can never be an insult ' her mother returned | 'i think otherwise ' said ethelberta | 'so do i ' said her father | 'unless the man was beneath you and i don't suppose he was that ' added mrs chickerel | 'you are quite right he was not that | but we will not talk of this branch of the subject | by far the most serious concern with me is that i ought to do some good by marriage or by heroic performance of some kind while going back to give the rudiments of education to remote hamleteers will do none of you any good whatever '| 'never you mind us ' said her father 'mind yourself '| 'i shall hardly be minding myself either in your opinion by doing that ' said ethelberta dryly | 'but it will be more tolerable than what i am doing now | georgina and myrtle and emmeline and joey will not get the education i intended for them but that must go i suppose '| 'how full of vagaries you are ' said her mother | 'why won't it do to continue as you are | no sooner have i learnt up your schemes and got enough used to 'em to see something in 'em than you must needs bewilder me again by starting some fresh one so that my mind gets no rest at all '| ethelberta too keenly felt the justice of this remark querulous as it was to care to defend herself | it was hopeless to attempt to explain to her mother that the oscillations of her mind might arise as naturally from the perfection of its balance like those of a logan stone as from inherent lightness and such an explanation however comforting to its subject was little better than none to simple hearts who only could look to tangible outcrops | 'really ethelberta ' remonstrated her mother 'this is very odd | making yourself miserable in trying to get a position on our account is one thing and not necessary but i think it ridiculous to rush into the other extreme and go wilfully down in the scale | you may just as well exercise your wits in trying to swim as in trying to sink '| 'yes that's what i think ' said her father | 'but of course berta knows best '| 'i think so too ' said gwendoline | 'and so do i ' said cornelia | 'if i had once moved about in large circles like ethelberta i wouldn't go down and be a schoolmistress not i '| 'i own it is foolish suppose it is ' said ethelberta wearily and with a readiness of misgiving that showed how recent and hasty was the scheme | 'perhaps you are right mother anything rather than retreat | i wonder if you are right | well i will think again of it to night | do not let us speak more about it now '| she did think of it that night very long and painfully | the arguments of her relatives seemed ponderous as opposed to her own inconsequent longing for escape from galling trammels | if she had stood alone the sentiment that she had begun to build but was not able to finish by whomsoever it might have been entertained would have had few terrors but that the opinion should be held by her nearest of kin to cause them pain for life was a grievous thing | the more she thought of it the less easy seemed the justification of her desire for obscurity | from regarding it as a high instinct she passed into a humour that gave that desire the appearance of a whim | but could she really set in train events which if not abortive would take her to the altar with viscount mountclere | in one determination she never faltered to commit her sin thoroughly if she committed it at all | her relatives believed her choice to lie between neigh and ladywell alone | but once having decided to pass over christopher whom she had loved there could be no pausing for ladywell because she liked him or for neigh in that she was influenced by him | they were both too near her level to be trusted to bear the shock of receiving her from her father's hands | but it was possible that though her genesis might tinge with vulgarity a commoner's household susceptible of such depreciation it might show as a picturesque contrast in the family circle of a peer | hence it was just as well to go to the end of her logic where reasons for tergiversation would be most pronounced | this thought of the viscount however was a secret for her own breast alone | nearly the whole of that night she sat weighing first the question itself of marrying lord mountclere and at other times whether for safety she might marry him without previously revealing family particulars hitherto held necessary to be revealed a piece of conduct she had once felt to be indefensible | the ingenious ethelberta much more prone than the majority of women to theorize on conduct felt the need of some soothing defence of the actions involved in any ambiguous course before finally committing herself to it | she took down a well known treatise on utilitarianism which she had perused once before and to which she had given her adherence ere any instance had arisen wherein she might wish to take it as a guide | here she desultorily searched for argument and found it but the application of her author's philosophy to the marriage question was an operation of her own as unjustifiable as it was likely in the circumstances | that their happiness would be in proportion to her own well doing and power to remove their risks of indigence required no proving either to her now | by a sorry but unconscious misapplication of sound and wide reasoning did the active mind of ethelberta thus find itself a solace | at about the midnight hour she felt more fortified on the expediency of marriage with lord mountclere than she had done at all since musing on it | in respect of the second query whether or not in that event to conceal from lord mountclere the circumstances of her position till it should be too late for him to object to them she found her conscience inconveniently in the way of her theory and the oracle before her afforded no hint | 'ah it is a point for a casuist '| she said | an old treatise on casuistry lay on the top shelf | she opened it more from curiosity than from guidance this time it must be observed at a chapter bearing on her own problem 'the disciplina arcani or the doctrine of reserve '| here she read that there were plenty of apparent instances of this in scripture and that it was formed into a recognized system in the early church | with reference to direct acts of deception it was argued that since there were confessedly cases where killing is no murder might there not be cases where lying is no sin | it could not be right or indeed anything but most absurd to say in effect that no doubt circumstances would occur where every sound man would tell a lie and would be a brute or a fool if he did not and to say at the same time that it is quite indefensible in principle | duty was the key to conduct then and if in such cases duties appeared to clash they would be found not to do so on examination | the lesser duty would yield to the greater and therefore ceased to be a duty | this author she found to be not so tolerable he distracted her | she put him aside and gave over reading having decided on this second point that she would at any hazard represent the truth to lord mountclere before listening to another word from him | 'well at last i have done ' she said 'and am ready for my role '| in looking back upon her past as she retired to rest ethelberta could almost doubt herself to be the identical woman with her who had entered on a romantic career a few short years ago | for that doubt she had good reason | she had begun as a poet of the satanic school in a sweetened form she was ending as a pseudo utilitarian | was there ever such a transmutation effected before by the action of a hard environment | it was not without a qualm of regret that she discerned how the last infirmity of a noble mind had at length nearly departed from her | she wondered if her early notes had had the genuine ring in them or whether a poet who could be thrust by realities to a distance beyond recognition as such was a true poet at all | yet ethelberta's gradient had been regular: emotional poetry light verse romance as an object romance as a means thoughts of marriage as an aid to her pursuits a vow to marry for the good of her family in other words from soft and playful romanticism to distorted benthamism | was the moral incline upward or down |37  knollsea an ornamental villa her energies collected and fermented anew by the results of the vigil ethelberta left town for knollsea where she joined picotee the same evening | picotee produced a letter which had been addressed to her sister at their london residence but was not received by her there mrs chickerel having forwarded it to knollsea the day before ethelberta arrived in town | the crinkled writing in character like the coast line of tierra del fuego was becoming familiar by this time | while reading the note she informed picotee between a quick breath and a rustle of frills that it was from lord mountclere who wrote on the subject of calling to see her suggesting a day in the following week | 'now picotee ' she continued 'we shall have to receive him and make the most of him for i have altered my plans since i was last in knollsea '| 'altered them again | what are you going to be now not a poor person after all '| 'indeed not | and so i turn and turn | can you imagine what lord mountclere is coming for | but don't say what you think | before i reply to this letter we must go into new lodgings to give them as our address | the first business to morrow morning will be to look for the gayest house we can find and captain flower and this little cabin of his must be things we have never known '| the next day after breakfast they accordingly sallied forth | knollsea had recently begun to attract notice in the world | it had this year undergone visitation from a score of professional gentlemen and their wives a minor canon three marine painters seven young ladies with books in their hands and nine and thirty babies | hence a few lodging houses of a dash and pretentiousness far beyond the mark of the old cottages which formed the original substance of the village had been erected to meet the wants of such as these | to a building of this class ethelberta now bent her steps and the crush of the season having departed in the persons of three quarters of the above named visitors who went away by a coach a van and a couple of wagonettes one morning she found no difficulty in arranging for a red and yellow streaked villa which was so bright and glowing that the sun seemed to be shining upon it even on a cloudy day and the ruddiest native looked pale when standing by its walls | it was not without regret that she renounced the sailor's pretty cottage for this porticoed and balconied dwelling but her lines were laid down clearly at last and thither she removed forthwith | from this brand new house did ethelberta pen the letter fixing the time at which she would be pleased to see lord mountclere | when the hour drew nigh enormous force of will was required to keep her perturbation down | she had not distinctly told picotee of the object of the viscount's visit but picotee guessed nearly enough | ethelberta was upon the whole better pleased that the initiative had again come from him than if the first step in the new campaign had been her sending the explanatory letter as intended and promised | she had thought almost directly after the interview at rouen that to enlighten him by writing a confession in cold blood according to her first intention would be little less awkward for her in the method of telling than in the facts to be told | so the last hair was arranged and the last fold adjusted and she sat down to await a new page of her history | the man was in his shirt sleeves but he put on his coat immediately | he had a kind of natural quiet dignity and a subdued manner the result of his trouble no doubt | we were in their little sitting room or parlor but the door into the kitchen where they had been taking their meal was open | the room we were in was very plainly furnished but perfectly neat and i was at once struck by the number of books that it contained | would you believe it | one of the leading magazines lay on the table | the mother a pale gaunt woman who looked utterly worn out went with the doctor to the adjoining sick room and the husband's eyes followed them anxiously |  'your place seems rather lonely ' i said to him 'but you evidently know how to find society in books '|  'yes ' he answered 'i s'pose this region seems lonesome to you but not to us who were brought up here | it all depends on what you're used to especially when you're a growin' up | i'm not much of a reader myself but tilly was' and he heaved a great sigh | 'she took to readin' almost as soon as to walkin' ' he continued 'and used to read aloud to us | i s'pose i soon dozed off but her mother took it all in and durin' the long winter evenin's they kinder roamed all over the world together | i suspicion tilly had more books than was good for her but she was our only child and i couldn't say no to her | she edicated herself to be a teacher and stood high and we was proud of her sure enough but i'm afeared all that study and readin' wasn't good for her ' and then came another of his deep sighs |  madge's great eyes meanwhile were more and more full of trouble and there was a deal of pathos suggested by the man's simple story | indeed i felt my own throat swelling at the poor man's last sigh it was so deep and natural and seemed to express a great sorrow for which there were no words in his homely vernacular |  what selfish egotists we are over our picayune vexations | graydon muttered |  well the mother and the doctor now appeared | the latter looked grave and when he looks grave things are serious indeed |  'ain't she no better '| the father asked with entreaty in his tone |  'i wish she was ' said the doctor in his blunt way which nevertheless expressed more sympathy than a lot of fine phrases | then he said to the mother: 'you're all worn out and yet she'll need close watching to night | isn't there some neighbor ' 'oh please let me stay '| began madge in a low eager tone speaking for the first time | 'i'm strong and i'll follow your directions in everything | do please | i've been ill myself and think i know how to nurse '|  the woman hesitated and looked doubtfully wonderingly at the doctor | madge sprang up and taking the mother's hand continued: 'indeed madam you do look worn out you will be ill yourself | for your daughter's sake as well as mine let me stay '|  'for your sake miss '|  'yes for my sake | why should i not bear a little of this heavy burden | it will do me good | doctor say i can stay | my strength should not be wasted in amusement only '|  'well ' he replied 'if mrs muir consents there's no one i'd trust sooner '|  'then it's settled mary ' she said in her decisive way | 'it's perfectly proper for me to stay under the protection of these good people '|  'but you haven't had your supper ' i began |  a little color came into the woman's face at my foolish speech and she said 'if the young lady will take what we can offer ' 'of course i will ' interrupted madge with a smile that would have propitiated a dragon 'a little bread and milk would suit me best '|  'she shall have a chicken broiled as nice as she ever tasted at the hotel ' said the man impulsively | 'heaven bless your kind heart and perhaps you can coax tilly to take a bit '|  'the young lady's name is miss alden ' said the doctor 'and this is mrs muir mr and mrs wendall ladies i should have introduced you before but my mind was on my patient | well well well what a world it is | some very good streaks run through it though '|  'i'll come for you in the morning ' i said to madge who had thrown off her hat looking so resolute and absorbed in her purpose that i knew there was nothing more to be said | so i shook hands with the poor people and came away with the doctor |  i'm going for madge in the morning said graydon decisively |  i thought you were going trouting with the doctor |  not till i've told madge what i think of her he said gravely |  i'm sure her impulse and motives were good |  they were more than good they were divine and just like madge alden as she now is | she keeps one's blood tingling with surprises but i've not become such a cynic that i do not understand her | when you come to think of it what is more natural than that one girl with her superb health should lend her strength to another who perhaps is dying but you may well ask who in the house would think of doing this |  yes the doctor said she was dying that she couldn't last much longer |  well i never had a sister but i'm just as proud of madge and just as fond of her as if she were my own flesh and blood | she shall never lack what a brother can do for her while i live |  i'm glad you feel so said mrs muir | then she sighed and thought a plague upon him | why will he keep following up the other white faced thing when he might win madge if he tried hard enough | it's plain that she don't care for him now except as she used to | and she does care for him just as she did before she went away in spite of all her prudishness about the words brother and sister | i'm not blind | she has grown so pretty however that i suppose graydon would wish to kiss her too often | she is just as fond of him as he is of her and in just the same way but if i had his chance i'd soon have it a different way and the good lady was complacency itself over her penetration as she bade graydon good night | no one could see and report the surface of affairs more accurately than she | as he descended to the hall arnault and miss wildmere entered | the latter hastened forward and gave him her hand most cordially saying why mr muir i'm ever so glad to see you you have been away an age |  a day miss wildmere | your appearance indicates that you have survived admirably |  the moon is so bright that we could drive fast and i'm always happy when in rapid motion |  you have had the advantage of me then yet i've been in rapid motion a good part of the day on express trains |  i feared you were not going to return to day she said as she strolled out with him on the piazza | feared   yes why not |  it strikes me that i might ask why |  surely you would not have me lose such an evening as this mr |muir  she said a little reproachfully |  i would have you follow your own heart |  i shall follow it as soon as possible she replied so earnestly that he was disarmed especially as the glance which accompanied the words was full of soft allurement and appeal | of her own accord she put her hand on his arm and spoke in low contented tones as if she had at last found rest and refuge | the moon poured around her a flood of radiance which gave her an ethereal aspect | her white drapery enhanced and spiritualized her remarkable beauty making her appear all that lover or poet could ask | his own words grew kinder and gentler his heart went out to her as never before she seemed so fair delicate and pure in that witching light that he longed to rescue her at once from her surroundings | why should he not | she had never manifested a more gentle and yielding mood | he directed her steps from the piazza to a somewhat distant summer house and her reluctance was a shy half revolt which only emphasized the natural meaning of her unspoken consent | mrs muir was still keeping her eyes open and from her window saw them pass under the shadow of the trees | at last they were sitting alone in the summer night | graydon felt that words were scarcely needed that his manner had spoken unequivocally and that hers had granted all but he took her hand and looked earnestly into her downcast face |  oh stella he began | a twig snapped in the adjacent grove | she sprang up |  hush graydon she whispered not yet | please trust me | oh what am i thinking of to be out so late but could not resist | come and she started for the house | as they passed in at the door he said in a low deep tone you cannot put me off much longer stella |  no graydon she whispered hurriedly and hastened to her room | in his deep feeling he had not heard the suspicious sound in the grove and miss wildmere's manner was only another expression of the strong constraint which he believed to be imposed upon her by her father's financial peril | he felt bitterly disappointed however | although irritated he was yet rendered more than forgiving by the apparent truth that she had almost yielded to the impulses of her heart in spite of grave considerations and promises perhaps to the contrary | he was at a loss what to do yet felt that the present condition of affairs was becoming intolerable | almost immediately upon his return from europe he had written to mr wildmere for permission to pay his addresses and had received a brief and courteous reply | the thought of again appealing to the father occurred to him but was speedily dismissed with unconquerable repugnance | the very fact that this man compelled his daughter to take such a course made graydon wish never to speak to him again |  no he muttered the girl must yield to me and cut loose from all her father's shifty ways and associations | the night was so beautiful and his thoughts kept him so wakeful that he sat in a shadow and watched the moonlight transfiguring the world into beauty | before long he heard a step and a man came from that end of the piazza which was nearest the summer house | as he passed in graydon saw that it was arnault | the quick suspicion came into his mind could he have been watching | then flashed another thought could she have become aware of his presence and was this the cause of her abrupt flight | the latter supposition was dismissed indignantly and at once | the affair was taking on an aspect however so intensely disagreeable that he resolved to write to miss wildmere that he would absent himself until arnault should disappear below the horizon | he would then go trouting or take a trip to some other resort | this course he believed would bring her to a decision and after their recent interview he could scarcely doubt its nature | before he was aware of it his thoughts returned to madge | in fancy he saw the gray farmhouse on the lonely mountain side with a sweet face at the window the dark sympathetic eyes now looking out on the silent moonlit landscape and again at the thin white face of a dying girl |  poor poor child | he thought reverting to the patient |  well for once at least she has had a good angel watching over her | i would like to see madge's face framed by the open window in this witching light | would to heaven that stella was more like her | yet stella was beautiful as a dream to night and it seemed that my vision of happiness was on the very eve of fulfilment | chapter xxvii madge's story early in the beautiful morning of the following day graydon was out securing a light carriage for he reasoned that after watching all night madge would be too weary to enjoy horseback exercise | he first called on the doctor and obtained careful directions as to the locality of madge's sojourn |  the best i can do is to go with you as guide this afternoon to the trout stream and then drive back by moonlight the doctor added | within an hour graydon reached the cottage and madge ran out to welcome him |  now this is kind and thoughtful of you she said and there was unmistakable gladness in her face |  dear madge you have had a long dismal night i fear | i can see it from the lines under your eyes |  it has been a sad night graydon yet i am very glad i came and you have now rewarded me | the poor girl is sleeping and i can slip away | mr and mrs wendall parted from her feelingly and gratefully | madge promised to come again soon | for a few moments they drove in silence and then madge sighed: how young fresh and full of beautiful life the world seems this morning | the contrast with that poor suffering dying girl is too great | nature often appears strangely indifferent |  i am not indifferent madge | i kept a sort of watch with you for an hour or two last night in the wee sma' hours and tried to imagine you sitting in just such an open window as i saw there with the moonlight on your face and i thought that the poor girl had one good angel watching over her | you know i am a man of the world but an act of ministry like this touches me closely |  no graydon not a good angel but a very human creature was the watcher |  tell me about it that is continue the story from the point where mary left off and he explained about mrs muir's account of the previous evening |  well you know what a wilful creature i am | she began with the glimmer of a smile |  oh yes i've learned to understand that feature of your royal womanhood | you are trying to be a woman madge | well you are one the kind i believe in | see how much faith i have i believe yet don't understand |  no jesting or compliments this morning please i'm too heavy hearted for them now |  you ought to be serene and happy after so kind and good a deed |  no she said decisively that sympathy must be superficial which can pass almost immediately into self complacency | oh graydon it is all so sad yet not sad so passing strange yet as natural and true as life and death | i did sit for hours just as you imagined looking out on the great still mountains | never did they seem so vast and stable and our life so vapor like as when i heard that poor fluttering breath come and go at my side | there was a time when this truth grew oppressive but later on that feeble life which seemed but a breath came to mean something greater and more real than the mountains themselves | but i am anticipating | as soon as mary departed i became as imperious as i dared to be | i saw that the poor mother had reached about the limit of her endurance and i arranged the lounge in the sitting room so that she could lie down at once saying: 'i am a stranger and young and it's not natural that you should be willing to give up to me too much nor do i wish you to be far away yet i can see just how sorely in need of rest you are | you must finish your supper give me your directions and then lie down and get every bit of rest you can | i can easily keep awake and promise to call you whenever you are needed '|  'nancy ' her husband added 'miss alden is right | i see by the way she takes hold that she'll do everything and you're jest beat out '| so between us we had our way |  'bless you miss ' said the man trying to smile in a way that almost made me cry 'i'm as handy as a woman 'bout a kitchen ' and he soon proved that he was handier than i could have been for in a few minutes he pulled up from the well a pail took out a dressed chicken and broiled it to perfection | i made his wife eat some of it and saved a little of the breast for poor tilly as they call her |  did you take any yourself | interrupted graydon |  oh yes indeed | i'm one of those prosaic creatures whose appetite never fails | if the world were coming to an end to day i should insist on having my breakfast |  madge said graydon ruefully i might as well tell you for i'm sure to be found out: i once called you 'lackadaisical ' |  oh i knew that over two years ago | what's more you were right |  no i was not right he answered positively |  i should have recognized the possibilities of your nature then | i did in regard to your beauty but not those higher qualities which bid fair to make you my patron saint |  oh hush graydon | such words only pain me | i don't want your compliments and if any man made a patron saint of me i should be so exasperated that i should probably box his ears | let us stick to what is simple natural and true in all our talk |  you may say what you please madge i see it more clearly every day and reproach myself that i did not understand you | i was content to amuse and pet you and you naturally did not think me capable of doing anything more | you went away alone to make as brave a fight as was ever battled out in this world and i had no part in helping you | mr and mrs wayland were worth a wilderness of superficial society fellows like me | i now know why you did not care to correspond with me while making your noble effort |  truly graydon your memory and penetration are phenomenal |  you may disclaim out of kindness now but i know i am right | you make my life appear shallow and trivial | what have i done in the last two years but attend carefully from habit to the details of business and then amuse myself | and when i wrote i merely sought to amuse you | what were my flippant letters worth to one who was in earnest |  graydon said madge looking into his eyes with gentle dignity you may do yourself injustice if you will but you shall not misjudge me | i have acquired a little of the art of taking care of myself and you are doing me a wrong which i cannot permit | i remember everything from the time that your kind eyes rested on the pallid shrinking child that crept down to the dining room when we first met and from that day to this you have been kind and helpful to me | i said that i regarded you as one of the best friends i had in the world | do you think me insincere | do you think i forget how kind you were when society would not have tolerated the ghost i was | i am not one who forgets and ignores the past who can go on to new friends with a frigid shoulder for old ones | let us end these misunderstandings | before the year is out you will probably be engaged perhaps married | our lives will be widely separated | that is inevitable from the nature of things | but distance and absence can cause no such separation as results from misunderstanding | if we should not meet again in twenty years i should be the same loyal friend | now i've said it and don't vex me again by speaking as if i had not said and meant it |  i can scarcely tell whether your words make me more glad or sad | each feeling is deeper than you will ever believe | you certainly give me the impression that if i marry stella wildmere our lives will be separated |  you don't take nature especially woman nature into consideration at all | i am not congenial to miss wildmere she does not like me | it is nothing against her but some people are antagonistic | this is especially true among women and in this case it is not strange | our experiences have been very different | she has ever been a beautiful brilliant society girl | with her at your side you would always be an object of envy in circles congenial to you for admiration would follow her as the light follows day | in the past you know i have not been influenced by society considerations and in the future they shall be very secondary | therefore we of necessity are unlike and could never be much company for each other | there is never any use in trying to ignore the old law of 'like unto like '| i say this in explanation of what you know is true all the world over | even the close ties of kindred often count for little where tastes occupations and habits of thought are diverse | all this is nothing against your perfect right to please yourself | in this land thank heaven | families and friends cannot yoke people together to pull forward general and miscellaneous interests |  you speak as if it were a slight thing when the woman whom a man marries is merely accepted tolerated by his kindred |  i have not said that graydon i have only said again what i said before that a man has a right to please himself | the truth is trite enough why recur to it |  gravitation is trite enough but it often has an acute bearing on one's experience | you do not like stella and she does not like me |  very well but you try to be just to her and when she has lived a while in different associations you will find her greatly changed | i think you can be her close friend in the future | but henry detests her and he is so quietly and obstinately tenacious in his views that the fact annoys me exceedingly |  very well you can't help that | you will live in different houses and your domestic life will be quite removed from business interests |  oh confound henry | he married to suit himself so shall i but madge dear madge you will try to love her to help her to be more like you for my sake | at last madge's laugh rang out merrily |  for mercy's sake graydon don't ask me to be a missionary to your wife she cried |  if i escaped with my eyes i should be lucky | you must think your wife perfection and make her think you do | woe be unto you if you introduce a female friend and suggest that she should be imitated even to the arch of an eyebrow | oh no i thank you | that's a sphere in which i shouldn't shine at all and i wouldn't dare attempt it with any feminine saint in the calendar | oh graydon what a dear old goose you are | and she laughed till the tears came into her eyes | he joined her in a half vexed way protesting that she was still as uncanny as a ghost although she had lost the aspect of one | suddenly she stopped and tears of sorrow filled her eyes |  here i am laughing at our absurd talk she said when i have just left the side of a poor girl no older than myself who is ghostly indeed in her flickering life | is it heartless to seem to forget so soon | oh graydon you don't know what trouble is | you have only had vexations thus far | let me tell you what happened last night if only to make you grateful for your strong prosperous life |  tell me anything you wish | i always have better thoughts and impulses after being with you |  please don't regard me as egotistical or offend me by thinking i am trying to be better than others | why shouldn't i help that poor girl | we often dance all night for fun why can't we watch occasionally for pity | and in simple truth it will be a long time before the ache for that poor creature will go out of my heart | it came very close home graydon very close | it brought to mind another girl who was once scarcely stronger or better than tilly wendall is to day but god was kind | tilly also has great black eyes and they do look so large and pathetic in the wan little face | at first they did not notice me much | i was only another of the watchers who had come to aid her mother | it's astonishing how kind these plain country people are to one another in trouble and many a housewife in this region has toiled all day and then sat up with the poor child the livelong night |  for the first few hours i could do little more than help her move in her weak restlessness and give remedies to relieve her incessant cough | the poor thing seemed neither more nor less than a victim of disease that with a cruelty almost malign had tortured her | i can't explain how this awful impression grew upon me | it was as if viewless brutal hands had racked the emaciated form until intelligence was gone and then not content would continue their vindictive work while breath remained in the body | as my watch was prolonged this impression grew into a nightmare of horror | the still house the silent white beautiful world without and that frail young girl tortured hour after hour under my eyes by fever and a convulsive incessant remorseless cough | she buried her face in her hands and for a moment or two her voice was choked with sobs |  oh madge cried graydon almost fiercely you anger me | i would strangle a man who harmed a hair of such a child's head | how can i worship a god who sends or permits such a thing | you are braver than i i could see a man shot but i couldn't look upon what you have described | yet the picture brings back the moment when we parted when you struggled feebly in my arms with a premonition of your almost mortal weakness and then sank back white and deathlike | if you had not made so wise and brave an effort you might have lingered on in torture like this poor girl | you stood in just that peril did you not |  i suppose i did |  oh what a clod i was | i used to hear you cough night after night and i would mutter 'poor madge '| and go to sleep | to think that you might have suffered as this girl is suffering | i never realized it before yet i thought i did | i can't tell you how my whole nature rebels at it all and pious talk about resignation in the presence of such scenes fairly makes me grind my teeth and his brow blackened like night in his mental revolt and his eyes were sternly fixed in honest indignant arraignment of the power he did not scruple to defy though so impotent to resist | madge brushed away her tears and watched him earnestly for a moment | in that confused instant she exulted in the strong generous kindly manhood that would not cringe even to omnipotence when apparently cruel | she said gently graydon you are condemning god |  i can't help it he began impetuously that is such a god she put her hand over his mouth |  i like you better for your words she continued but please don't talk so any more | let what you have said apply to 'such a god ' i know what you mean but there is no such being in existence | let me finish my story | we have had too many interruptions and this secluded road has an end | i won't try to explain my faith | what happened may make it clearer to you | well tilly gradually grew quieter and at last slept | the tired mother was sleeping also and i sat at the window just as you imagined my thoughts sad and questioning to say the least at last i saw that tilly was awake and looking at me with something like interest and curiosity | i went to her and asked if i could do anything |  she said in her slow feeble way 'i thought i knew every one about here but i don't remember to have seen you before '|  then i told her who i was and that her mother was in the next room |  'you are very kind ' she said | 'and you are from the hotel | isn't it a little strange '|  'it should not be ' i replied and explained how i came to stay adding 'don't talk any more | you are not strong enough '|  with a quiet smile that astonished me she said 'it won't make any difference miss alden i shall never be any better or rather i shall soon be well | my mind seems growing clearer and i'd like to talk a little | it is strange to see a young girl here | are you strong and well '|  'yes very strong and very glad to help your mother take care of you | i was once almost as ill as you are yet i got well | cheer up and let us nurse you back to health '|  she shook her head | 'no that's now impossible | you come and cheer poor mother and father miss alden | i am more than cheerful i am happy '|  i made her call me madge and said: 'tell me then in a few words how you can be happy | my heart has just been aching for you ever since i came '|  perhaps she saw tears in my eyes for she said 'sit down by me '| then she took my hand leaned her cheek upon it and looked at me with such a lovely sympathy in her beautiful dark eyes |  'yes ' she said 'i see you are young and strong and you probably have wealth and many friends still i think i am better off than you are | i am almost home and you may have long weary journeying before you yet | you ask me why i am happy | i'll just give you the negative reasons: think how much they mean to me and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain | all these may be taken from my life any hour | think of what will be added to it | you believe all this madge '|  'yes '|  'then you must know why i am happy and why i may be better off than you are | it will be very hard for father and mother there will be more pain for them here in consequence but soon it will all end forever in a little while we shall be together again | so you know nearly all about poor little me ' she said with another of her smiles which were the sweetest yet most unearthly things i ever saw | 'and now tell me about yourself | i'm not able to talk much more for the present | i'd like to know something about the friend who helped me through the last few steps of my journey | i can think about you in heaven you know ' she said with the sweetest little laugh | 'don't look so sad madge | they'll tell you i'm gone soon |  gone where | ask yourself and never grieve a moment '|  oh graydon she made it all seem so real talking there alone in the night | and it is just as she says or it isn't anything | when you said 'such a god ' you had in mind a theological phantom and i don't wonder you felt as you did but this girl believes in a god who 'so loved the world' who so loved her and i do also | her pain her thwarted young life i don't understand any more than i do other phases of evil but i can give my allegiance to one who came to take away the evil of the world | that's about all the religion i have and you mustn't ever say a word against it |  well there is but little more to tell | tilly spoke in quiet broken sentences as her cough permitted and i told her a little about myself and sang to her some hymns that mother sang to me when i was a child | with the dawn her mother came in and was frightened at having slept so long but tilly laughed and said it was just splendid |  she was evidently a very intelligent girl and must have been a pretty one too | she certainly has read a great deal and has taught in public schools | there didn't seem to be a trace of morbidness in her mind or feeling | she was simply trying to make the best of everything and her best certainly is the best | she has helped and comforted me more than i could her |  comforted you madge |  oh well was the somewhat confused reply |  i've had trouble and shall have again | who is without it long in this world |  it's almost hard to see how serious trouble can reach you hereafter you are so strong so fortified | no madge i'll never say a word against your faith or that of your new friend | would to heaven i had it myself | i wouldn't have missed this talk with you for the world and you can't know how i appreciate the friendship which has led you to speak to me frankly of what is so sacred | all the whirl and pressure of coming life and business shall never blot from my memory the words you have spoken this morning or the scenes you have made so real | if this were true how infinitely deeper would have been his impression if he could have seen the beautiful girl now smiling into his eyes bowed in agony at that sick bed while she acknowledged with stifled sobs that the dying girl was better off far happier than she who had to face almost the certainty of lifelong disappointment | poor madge had not told graydon all her story | she would have died rather than have her secret known on earth but she had not feared to breathe it to one on the threshold of heaven | chapter xxviii dispassionate lovers during the last moments of their drive madge and graydon were comparatively silent | they were passing dwellings meeting strangers and they could not with the readiness of natures less finely organized descend to commonplaces | each had abundant food for thought while even graydon now believed that he so truly understood madge and had so much in common with her that words were no longer needed for companionship | as they approached the piazza they saw that arnault was still miss wildmere's devoted attendant | his presence meant hope for madge and graydon was slightly surprised at his own indifference | he felt that the girl to whom he regarded himself as bound belonged to a different world a lower plane of life than that of which he had been given a glimpse | the best elements of his nature had been profoundly moved and brought to the surface and he found them alien to the pair on the piazza | he was even self reproachful that he saw with so little resentment stella's present companionship |  while i don't like her course at all he thought i must believe that she is acting from the most self sacrificing motives | what troubles me most now is that i have a growing sense of the narrowness of her nature | he had never come from her presence with his manhood aroused to its depths | it was her beauty that he dwelt upon her piquant alluring tones and gestures | madge was not an ill natured critic of the girl who threatened to destroy her future but by being simply what she was she made the other shrink and grow common by contrast | to graydon such comparisons were odious indeed and he would not willingly permit them but in conformity to mental laws and the force of circumstances they would present themselves | each day had found him in the society of the two girls and even an hour like one of those just passed compelled him to feel the superiority of madge | his best hope already for stella was that she would change when surrounded by better influences that her faultless taste in externals would eventually create repugnance to modes of thought and action unsuitable in a higher plane of life | he did not question his love for her but he felt this morning that it was a love which was becoming disenchanted early and into which the elements of patience and tolerance might have to enter largely | should he marry her to day he could not as madge had said and with the first glow of affection believe her perfect | he even sighed as he thought of the future | his heart was very tender toward madge but it was with an affection that seemed to him partly fraternal and partly a regard for one different better purer than himself | he proved the essential fineness the capabilities of his nature by his appreciation of some of her higher traits | her ministry to the dying girl had given her a sacredness in his eyes | for the time she was becoming a sort of religion to him | he revealed this attitude of mind to her by a gentle manner and a tone of respect and consideration in the least thing he said |  oh thought the poor girl he could be so much to me and i to him | his touch even in thought would never be coarse and unfeeling and i have seen again and again that i can inspire him move him and make him happy | why must a wretched blunder thwart and blight two lives | before they had finished their breakfast the beautiful languor of sleep was again in his companion's eyes and he said: dear madge promise me you will take a long rest | before we part i want to tell you what an illumined page you have put in my memory this morning | some of the shadows in the picture are very dark but there is also a light in it that 'never was on sea or land '| when you wake i shall be on my way to the trout stream to which dr sommers will guide me and do you know | i feel as if my memories will be in accord with the scene of my camping ground | as i sit in my tent door to night i shall think over all you have said and described | her only answer was a smile that for some reason quickened his pulse | much occurred before they met again | he went to his room wrote some letters and made other preparations | then feeling that he should give the remaining time before his departure to miss wildmere he sought her | she appeared to be waiting for him on the piazza and there was reproach in her tone as she said i half feared you were going without bidding me good by |  such fears were scarcely just to me |  i did not know but that you had so greatly enjoyed your morning drive as to go away in a fit of absent mindedness | i have been sitting here alone an hour |  i could not know that | when i drove up i saw that i should be de trop he replied as they sauntered to an adjacent grove |  now graydon you know that is never true so far as i am concerned |  the trouble is miss wildmere others are concerned in such a way that the only resource left me is to keep my distance |  mr arnault has returned to the city she said with what appeared a great sigh of relief |  i am perfectly free now |  till mr arnault returns |  i cannot help his return |  oh no | i do not question his right to come back or even to buy this hotel and turn us all out |  please don't talk about him any more | i'm doing the best i can |  i believe you think so but i cannot think it will prove the best for any one | it is not what i expected or even imagined | you are acting from a mistaken sense of duty and i am more sorry every day that you can commit such an error | look at it in its true light stella | i cannot believe you are deceiving me: you must be leading mr arnault to entertain a false hope |  graydon i have refused mr arnault and he will take no refusal |  you can refuse him in such a way that he must take it at once and forever |  you don't know she began tears coming into her eyes |  no you have only led me to surmise a great deal by implication |  what would become of mamma and my little sister if papa should fail utterly | and tears came faster | no one could be more pathetic than miss wildmere when she chose |  can you not trust me for them as well as for yourself |  oh mr muir i know you mean most generously and kindly but papa is so anxious and fearful | he tries to keep up before others but i know how he feels and it's terrible | he is past middle age and business success means very much to him | how can i do anything to harm him | i know so little about business and its perils while papa thinks there may be terrible dangers ahead for every one | you might have the good will to help us and yet soon be scarcely able to help yourself | i have been made to feel that the best i could do through these troublous times was to try to aid papa as far as possible and then i shouldn't have anything with which to reproach myself | graydon was perplexed | apparently she was doing wrong in the most self sacrificing spirit and believed that doing right which would end her abnegation was wrong and selfish | while he hesitated she resumed: you see graydon papa has the same as said that mr arnault was tiding him over until he could realize on securities now of little value | of course there has been no compromising understanding in words do not think us capable of that | it would cut me to the heart to have you misjudge me or condemn me | i will give you the highest proof i can of my my esteem by being frank on a delicate subject so that you can see how i am placed | i don't think many young ladies would do as much | of course what i say is sacred between us | mr arnault offered himself long since and i promptly declined the honor but he laughingly told me he would take no refusal and chatted through the rest of the evening as pleasantly as if nothing had happened | i have virtually refused him several times since but he persists declaring that he will remain an agreeable friend until i change my mind | surely i am not misleading him | i do like him as a friend and he knows that i have for him no other regard and never had | before you came he had begun to help papa and to throw business in his way and just now he is rendering him very great service | he may do this in the hope of influencing me but he gives his aid without conditions | yet i know him well enough to be sure that he would withdraw this business help should i now harshly dismiss him or engage myself to another | while i do show him that i appreciate his kindness i do nothing to indicate that my feeling is changed | he must know that i regard him in the same light as in the past | if he is content with this i have asked myself why i should be precipitate why alienate him now in the very crisis of papa's affairs | of course if i had only myself to think of i've been foolish enough to think that i might help papa and still be happy in the end | am i so very naughty graydon | he was at a loss how to answer her but felt that he must at once disabuse her mind of one expectation |  i admit stella he said thoughtfully that you are peculiarly placed and i thank you for making clearer what i had partially surmised | while i admire and respect the motive i must still repeat that i regret beyond all words such action in one who is so much to me | it is right also that i should define my own position more clearly | i will imitate your generous frankness | you know how greatly i admired you before i first went abroad and while i felt that there was little chance for me you being sought by so many i did not give up hope | this hope was strengthened by my visit last summer and when i returned and found you free a few weeks since i determined to win you if i could | you know i would have spoken before had you permitted | i have for some little time felt myself irrevocably bound by what has passed between us | i also believed that you would eventually give me a full explanation in regard to mr arnault and that his attentions would cease | as to my not being able to take care of you that is absurd | i am not wealthy yet but few young men in the city have better prospects | my brother's business is large and profitable and i am soon to share in it | i could not from the nature of things enter into business relations with your father i should not be at the head of the firm but neither you nor yours should ever want | as to my brother he is in no financial danger whatever | he has a large fortune and is conservatism itself | if you are placed in an embarrassing position i am also | arnault's manner is not that of a friend | others misjudge you and me also | it looks to the people here and to my own family as if you were playing with us both |  moreover he continued after a moment's thought you are drifting into a false relation with arnault although you may not be conscious of it | before these troubles began you simply tolerated his attentions good naturedly and without any special motive | now you have a definite motive and purpose and pardon me stella they are misleading him | he would not continue his attentions an hour did he believe they were utterly hopeless | to arnault and all others you appear undecided between him and myself | such an experiment as you are trying cannot work well | if he has any other power beyond that of your maidenly preference he will not hesitate to increase it and may make your father more utterly dependent upon him while appearing helpful |  yes i have thought of that she said musingly |  there seems to me but one straightforward high toned thing for you to do stella and that is to follow your heart | he was almost frightened at himself that he spoke with so little eagerness and longing | his words seemed but the honorable and logical sequence of what had gone before | for some reason this girl in the broad light of day did not appear to be the same as when she had fascinated him in the witching moonlight the evening before | it was not that her beauty had gone with the glamour of the night but he had been breathing a different and a purer atmosphere | madge had been revealing what to him seemed ideal womanhood | in regard to stella his illusion had so far passed that he thought consciously even at her best she is presenting wildmere traits her very self sacrifice takes on a wildmere form and there is a flavor of wall street in it all | but he still believed that he loved her and that if she was equal to such great though mistaken self sacrifice for her father she would under his influence throw off certain imperfections and gain a better tone | that such thoughts were passing through his mind was a bad omen for the continuance of miss wildmere's power and yet the opportunity of her life was still hers | she had simply to put her hand into his with a look of trust and abide by the act to secure a loyalty that would always have tried to promote her best interests | that she was strongly tempted to do this was proved by her manner in spite of the fact that she had promised arnault not to decide against him before saturday | it was a moment of indecision | his strong assurance that he was abundantly able to take care of her that mr muir was wealthy and free from financial embarrassment almost turned the scale | she felt that both arnault and her father were deceiving her for their own purposes and she had little hesitation in acting for herself without regard to them | graydon's suggestion that her action was not high toned although delicately made touched her pride to the quick and she was compelled to feel during this interview as never before the superiority of the man who addressed her | she longed to force henry muir to acknowledge the daughter of the man he shunned in business and not the least among her incentives was the thought of triumphing over madge as a possible rival |  at any rate she had thought if i become engaged to graydon he will have to be very much less fraternal | as to his not aiding papa she concluded i can't help that | when once married i could make him do all he could afford and papa and mamma have no right to expect anything more | to the potency of all these considerations was added a sentiment for the man who awaited her answer and who chafed inwardly that it was so long in coming |  truly he thought this is a strange wooing | henry himself could not more carefully weigh the pros and cons than does she apparently nor am i in feverish suspense | i had hoped for something different in my mating | a glimmering perception that her manner was not calculated to inspire a lover at last dawned on miss wildmere and with it came a faltering purpose to decide in favor of graydon at once but as she turned toward him to speak with what was meant to be a bewildering smile of joy a messenger from the office said a telegram miss | graydon frowned and then laughed outright | she stopped in the very act of tearing open the envelope and looked at him inquiringly |  oh nothing he said lightly |  the opportuneness of that fellow's coming was phenomenal | how much longer am i to wait for your decision stella | were the world in our secret i should be known as st graydon the patient | she flushed but adopted his apparently light mood as the least embarrassing |  my memory is good and i shall know how to reward you she smilingly replied |  please let me satisfy my mind about papa for i'm sure it's from him |  oh satisfy your mind fully about everything miss wildmere | she tore open the envelope with a strong gesture of impatience and read with a suddenly paling cheek unless you choose the immediate certainty of absolute loss wait till i see you | will come soon |wildmere  she crushed the telegram in her hand and turned away with a half tragic air which at the moment struck graydon as a little stagy and then he condemned himself for the thought | as she did not speak for a moment he said sympathetically your tidings are bad | she tried to think but was confused and felt that she was in a cruel dilemma | could graydon be deceiving her | or was he as ignorant as he seemed of his brother's peril | was her father in league with arnault after all | and were they uniting to separate her from graydon | she could not tell | she must gain more time | she would see her father charge him with duplicity and wring the truth from him | when she turned to graydon her eyes were full of tears again and she faltered: you may despise me if you will but my father has made an appeal to me and is coming to see me | i must hear what he has to say | i must tell him that i can't endure that i can't go on this way any longer | i would gladly help him save him but after what you have said it's impossible to oh was ever a girl placed in such wretched straits | graydon can you be patient a little longer |  there is nothing else for me to do stella | i only stipulate that your decision be made speedily and that arnault be given to understand what my rights are | i shall have no difficulty in enforcing them |  i shall decide speedily | it is not right that i should be placed in such a torturing humiliating position |  now i agree with you perfectly | when does your father come |  he says 'soon ' |  very well i will return on saturday |  i wish you wouldn't go away now she entreated |  i think it is best replied graydon decisively yet kindly |  i have said all that is possible to an honorable man | by remaining i am placed in an anomalous position which my self respect does not permit any longer |  i suppose she sighed that i should not ask too much | well so be it then | they walked back to the house in silence | at the door of a side entrance she turned to him her face flushing at the admission and said hastily i waited a long time for you graydon and then fled to her room |  oh confound it | he muttered as he walked away |  what a muddle it all is | i ought to feel like strangling myself for permitting this doubting cynical spirit to creep over me | curse it all | her words and manner haven't the ring of absolute truth | it seems as if i heard a voice in the very depths of my soul saying 'beware '| am i becoming an imbecile | i doubted and misjudged madge | thank heaven that is past forever | now i am doubting and misjudging the woman i have asked to be my wife | i must be misjudging her the alternative is horrible | i can't escape one conviction however | it is turning out just as i expected and told her it would | arnault's aid to her father has been delusive and wildmere is deeper in the mire than ever | this is a fine ending of my social career | the girl of my choice puts me off until she can end this wall street business more satisfactorily | she must wait and hear her father's reasons for further diplomacy before she can answer me | if henry knew all this but madge crystal madge won't repeat what i said | i must risk the loss of her society also | has her keen insight into character enabled her to detect these wildmere traits and is this the cause of her antipathy | how simply she said 'i couldn't do' what stella has accomplished with so much skill that the gossips in the house are in honest doubt as to her choice or whether indeed she proposes to accept either arnault or myself | well well i'll wait till she has had this interview with her father and then she must either decide for me and against such tactics forever or else she can wear my scalp in her belt with those of the other unfortunates | in an hour he was on the road with dr sommers to a wild and secluded valley | chapter xxix the enemies' plans it has been shown that arnault believed the decisive period to have come that would see the success or failure of his operation in the catskills | keen penetrating he had comprehended the situation clearly | he knew that stella wished to accept graydon and was held in check by financial considerations only | he had seen her manner during the preceding moonlight evening and with intense anger had observed from a neighboring grove the episode in the summer house | the twig had not casually parted under his step but had been snapped between his fingers | stella's quick alarm and flight had revealed the continuance of his hold upon her fears if not her heart | from that moment he dismissed all indecision | in bitterness he realized that his prolonged stay in the mountains had not advanced his interests | he had hoped to win the girl by devotion keeping financial pressure in the background she had been only suave agreeable and elusive | he had told her that he expected her decision by saturday evening she had merely bowed in a non committal way | meanwhile it was evident that if the muirs kept up apparently retaining the power to pass unscathed to better times she would prolong her hesitancy and in the end accept graydon | he determined therefore to see her first then her father and to call in his loan immediately | while graydon and madge were returning next morning from the lonely farmhouse arnault was breakfasting at the hotel | he appeared in excellent spirits | miss wildmere's alert observation could not detect from his manner his knowledge of the fact that she had been on the point of yielding to graydon the evening before | he was full of gallant courtesy toward her and every glance and word expressed admiration | this was always the breath of life to her and while it had ceased to give positive pleasure its absence was like uncomfortable weather | after the meal was over he led her to the same summer house in which graydon had almost spoken words endowed with a lover's warmth and eagerness |  stella he said i shall go to town on the ten o'clock train |  i supposed you had concluded to remain all the week she replied |  no very important interests call me to the city much to my regret | you only bowed when i requested that i should receive a final answer before the close of this week | i shall return saturday | will you end my suspense within this time | she was silent |  will you make me another promise then | will you remain free this week | if you will not bind yourself to me will you promise that no one else shall have a claim upon you until the time specified expires | after some hesitation she said yes i will promise that |  please do so and you will not regret it was his quiet response |  i am not so eager to be bound that i cannot promise so much |  very well then i am content for the present and he changed the subject | they soon returned to the piazza and arnault employed his utmost effort to be agreeable during the brief time remaining | earlier in the week he had written mr wildmere a letter in consequence of which the momentous telegram had restrained the daughter at the critical moment already mentioned | when madge came down to a late dinner she saw that arnault had disappeared from the wildmere table and that the belle was already a victim of ennui in the absence of both gentlemen | during the afternoon mrs muir was eager to gossip a little over the aspect of affairs but soon found that madge would do scarcely more than listen |  i don't understand that miss wildmere at all said the elder sister late last evening she went to yonder summer house hanging on graydon's arm as if they were engaged or married and now he's gone to be absent several days | this morning she was there again with arnault and he wasn't talking about the weather either | now he's gone also | before graydon went she had another long interview with him while you were asleep | good gracious | what is she aiming at | young men were not so patient in my day or in our village and quiet as henry appears he wouldn't play second string to a bow as graydon does | when miss wildmere first came i thought it was about settled and i tried to be polite to one whom i thought we should soon have to receive | now it's a sort of neck and neck race between the two men | if graydon wins how shall you treat miss wildmere |  politely for graydon's sake of course |  whose chances are best | graydon's   do you think she loves him |  yes as far as she can love any one '|  why madge what do you mean |  she could not love as we should she doesn't know what the word means | if she did she wouldn't hesitate |  you think henry's opinion of her is correct then |  i think he's right usually | miss wildmere is devoted to one being herself |  why madge it would be dreadful to have graydon marry such a girl |  graydon is not harry muir | he attained his majority some years since |  he certainly is old enough to show more spirit | well i don't understand her tactics but such belles i suppose are a law unto themselves |  don't let us gossip about her any more | if graydon becomes engaged there is only one thing for us to do | miss wildmere has made herself disagreeable to me in many little nameless ways and we never could be friends but i shall not give graydon cause for just complaint | if he asks me to see her with his eyes i shall laugh at him and decline |  they shall never live with us said mrs muir emphatically |  i know i'm not a brilliant and accomplished woman but i have always made home a place of rest and comfort for henry and i intend it always shall be just such a refuge | he is nervous and uncomfortable whenever that girl comes near him | some people can't get on together at all | i am so glad that he likes you | he says you are one that a man could depend upon in all sorts of weather |  we'll see but i like santa barbara weather which is usually serene |  oh madge you'll not go there again |  yes i shall probably make it my home | i should never keep my health in the east and i should dread a winter in new york more than i can tell you |  well said mrs muir discontentedly i suppose you will have your own way in everything hereafter but i think you might at least try to spend a winter with us |  if there were cause i would mary but you are happy in your home and i am not greatly needed | in my western home i feel i can get the most out of life just as you are getting the most out of yours | i should suffer from my old troubles in new york | this statement was true enough to both ladies although a very prosaic impression was conveyed to mrs muir's mind | to madge graydon's absence contained a strong element of hope | he would not have gone away if all had been settled between him and miss wildmere and as mary had said there appeared stronger evidence of uncertainty now than at first | graydon had seen miss wildmere and she evidently had not finally dismissed arnault | madge indulged in no idle brooding however and by activity every hour in the day passed the time bravely | one of her boy admirers had a horse and became her escort on long excursions and with mrs muir she went to see tilly wendall again on friday morning | the poor girl was very weak indeed and could do little more than smile her welcome | madge promised to spend sunday night with her | she would have come before but graydon had told her that he might return friday evening and as a storm was threatening she thought it probable that he would hasten back to avoid it | she believed that there was still hope for her and determined that she should never have cause in the future to reproach herself with lost opportunities | there was no imperative call of duty to her sick friend for mrs wendall said that two or three neighbors had lately offered their services | mrs muir was gladdened on her return to the hotel by a telegram from her husband saying that he would arrive on the late train and spend saturday with her | she and madge sat down to dinner in a cheerful mood which evidently was not shared by miss wildmere | that brilliant young woman although she made herself the centre of all things as far as possible was a victim of poverty when thrown upon her own resources | madge detected her in suppressed yawns and had noted that she had apparently done little else than read novels since parting with the two men who were metaphorically at her feet | since the telegram she had not received a word from her father or any one and was inwardly chafing at the dead calm that had followed her exciting experiences | she did not misinterpret the deceptive peace however and knew that on the morrow she must decide what even she regarded as the most momentous question of life | persons under the dominion of pure selfishness escape many perplexities however and she was prone to take short cuts to desired ends | ready to practice deceit herself she became more strongly impressed that her father and arnault were misleading her | therefore she impatiently awaited the former's appearance that she might tax him with duplicity | unless he had something stronger than vague surmises to offer she intended on the morrow to promise graydon muir to be his wife | as has been seen wildmere had too much conscience to try to sell his daughter outright but since she was in a mood for a bargain he had insured the possibility of one remarkably good in his estimation and was now on his way with very definite offers and statements indeed | in the late afternoon madge was speaking about a book to an acquaintance who said go up to my room and get it | madge was not sure whether she cared to read the book or not and sat down to examine it | suddenly she heard distinctly the words i don't believe henry muir is in danger of failure | graydon scouted the idea | you and arnault are seeking to mislead me | madge then remembered that the next room was occupied by miss wildmere and her first impulse was to make a noise that the proximity of some one might be known but like a flash came the thought chance may have put me in the way of getting information of vital importance to henry and the next sentence spoken assured her that this was true for she heard a voice which she recognized as mr wildmere's say: in all human probability muir will be compelled to suspend to morrow | mr arnault has placed in his hands a call loan | you know what that is | arnault is so alarmed about muir's condition that he will demand the money in the morning and i am perfectly satisfied that muir can't raise it | you know enough about business to be aware of what will happen if he cannot | such is the market now that if muir goes down he will be cleaned out utterly and graydon will have to begin at the bottom like any other young man without resources | of course arnault cannot afford to lose the money and must act like any other business man |  but he did not send me here to tell you this | as his broker i know about it and tell you of my own accord | this is what he did authorize me to say to you | had not business interests which have already suffered from his devotion to you prevented he would be here now to make the offer in person | he says that he will settle upon you one hundred thousand dollars in your own right the day you marry him and also give you an elegant home in the city | now what is your answer |  when henry muir fails i'll believe all this was the sullen reply |  be careful stella | devoted as arnault is he is not a man to be trifled with | he has made you a munificent offer but if you show this kind of spirit he is just the one to withdraw at once and forever | if you love graydon muir well enough to share his poverty i have not another word to say although i shall be homeless myself in consequence |  nonsense papa | you have been on the eve of ruin more times than i can remember | graydon assured me that he was abundantly able to take care of me and that his brother was in no danger | i can have all the elegance i want and still follow my own inclination | if henry muir fails of course that ends the matter and if he is to fail to morrow it will be time enough to give mr arnault my answer to morrow night as he asked that i would | if i give him a favorable one i prefer to do it in person for i don't wish to appear mercenary | you i hope have the sense to keep this phase out of view |  oh certainly | such high minded people as we are should not be misjudged was the bitter reply |  one has to take the world as it is and one soon learns that all are looking after their own interests was the cynical reply |  a beautiful sentiment for one so young | well i must return to the city to night and i cannot take your acceptance of mr arnault's offer | no  i will give my answer in person to morrow night | i can either accede in a way that will please him or decline in a manner that will keep his friendship | i suppose you believe what you say about mr muir but i am sure you are mistaken and i have set my heart on marrying graydon |  your heart |satirically  she made no answer |  you are taking no slight risk he resumed after a moment |  either arnault is misleading you or graydon is deceiving me and i would believe him in preference to arnault any day | i won't be duped |  but i tell you stella that under the circumstances graydon's ignorance is not at all strange | he has been absent he is not in the firm and what is swamping muir is an investment outside of his regular business |  you yourself said within a month that if henry muir went through this business crisis he would represent one of the strongest and wealthiest houses in the country | if he is in the danger you assert the fact will soon be manifested | mr arnault has requested my answer to morrow night | i have not promised to give it i have only promised him not to accept graydon in the meantime |  the fact that mr arnault is helping me so greatly counts for nothing i suppose |  oh yes i appreciate it very much but not enough to marry him unless i must | i am literally following your advice to choose between these two men | i shall convey to mr arnault the impression that i am deeply moved by the generosity of his offer | i am | girls don't get such offers every day | you can show him that the very fact of my hesitation proves that i am not mercenary or i can when i see him | at the same time i am not at all satisfied that graydon muir's offer is not a better one and it is certainly more to my mind if you don't like the word heart | this fact however may as well not be mentioned | after some moments' hesitation he said slowly: very well then | you are my daughter although a strange one and i shall do as well for you as i can |  yes please | i parted with sentiment long ago but i can do well by those who do well by me | i shall soon be off your hands and then you won't have me to worry about | he made no response and madge heard his step pass into his wife's room | a moment later miss wildmere also departed and her voice was soon heard on the piazza | the conversation had been carried on in a comparatively low tone and some words had been lost but those heard made the sense given above | circumstances had favored madge | the open window at which she was sitting was near the next window in miss wildmere's room and within two or three feet there was the customary thin panelled door which enables the proprietor to throw rooms together as required for the accommodation of families | therefore without moving or volition on her part information vital to her relatives had been brought to her knowledge | she was perfectly overwhelmed at first and sat as if stunned her cheeks scarlet with shame for the act of listening even while she felt that for the sake of the innocent and unsuspecting to whom she owed loyalty and love it was right | soon however came the impulse to seek the refuge of her own room and think of what must be done | she stepped lightly to the outer door there was no sound in the corridor and with all the composure she could assume she passed quietly out and gained her own apartment unobserved | chapter xxx the strong man unmanned madge locked her doors bathed her hot face then paced her room in great agitation feeling that not only her own happiness was in peril but graydon's also | her mental distress was greatly enhanced by a feeling that in order to save her relatives she herself had been guilty of what to her sensitive nature appeared almost like a crime |  well i won't bother him with questions until he comes round a bit | you zeally had better step into my room though and give me your version of the affair | but as the corporal saluted and took a step forward the prisoner opened his eyes |  before you examine zeally sir let me save you what trouble i can | he spoke faintly but with deliberation |  i wish to deny nothing | i was escaping and he tracked me | he came on me as i cut across the park and challenged | i did not answer but ran around a corner of the house and jumped the parapet thinking to double along the trench there and put him off the scent at least to dodge the bullet if he fired | but as i jumped for it he winged me | a very pretty shot too | with your leave sir i 'd like to shake hands with him on it | shake hands corporal | raoul stretched out a hand sideways |  you're a smart fellow and no malice between soldiers | dorothea heard polly's gasp: it seemed to her that all the room must hear it | her own hand trembled on the bandage | she had forgotten her danger the all but inevitable scandal until raoul brought it back to her and in the same breath saved her by his heroic lie | she could not profit by it though | her lips parted to refute it and for the first time she gazed up at him her eyes brimming with sudden love gratitude pride even while they entreated against the sacrifice | he was smiling down with an air of faint amusement yet beneath the lashes she read a command which mastered her will imposed silence | he had taken on a new manliness and for the first time in the story of their loves she felt herself dominated by something stronger than passion | he had swept her off her feet before now by boyish ardour: her humility the marvel of being loved had aided him but hitherto in her heart she had always felt her own character to be the stronger | now he challenged her on woman's own ground that of self abnegation he commanded her to his own hurt he towered above her | she had never dreamed of a love like this | beaten despairing for him yet proud as she had never been in her life she held her breath | corporal zeally was merely bewildered | his was a deliberate mind and had hatched out the night's catastrophe after incubating it for weeks | unconvinced by polly's explanation of her meeting with m raoul at the nursery gate he had nursed a dull jealousy and set himself to watch and had dogged his man down at length with the slow cunning of a yokel bred of a line of poachers | raoul's tribute to his smartness perplexed him and almost he scented a trap |  beg your pardon squire he began heavily forgetting military forms of address but the gentleman don't put it right |  oh hang your british modesty | put in raoul with a wry laugh |  if it pleases you to represent that the whole thing was accidental and you don't deserve to be promoted sergeant for tonight's work at least you might respect my vanity | polly saw her opportunity | she crossed boldly and made as if to lay over the corporal's mouth the hand that would fain have boxed his ears |  reckon this is my affair she announced with an effrontery at which one of the footmen guffawed openly |  be modest as you please my lad when i've married 'ee but i won't put up with modesty from anyone under a sergeant and that i warn 'ee | the corporal eyed his sweetheart without forgiveness | his mouth was open but upon the word sergeant he shut it again and began to digest the idea |  you know of course sir endymion westcote addressed the prisoner coldly to what such a confession commits you | i do not see what other construction the facts admit but it is so serious in itself and in its consequences that i warn you i have broken my parole sir said raoul simply |  of the temptations you cannot judge | of the shame i am as profoundly sensible as you can be | the consequences i am ready to suffer | he sank back in his chair as dr ibbetson entered | an hour later dorothea said goodnight to her brother in the great hall | he had lit his candle and was mixing himself a glass of brandy and water |  the sight of blood he excused himself |  i am sorry for the fellow though i never liked him | i suppose now there was nothing between him and that girl polly | for a moment from zeally's manner he gulped down the drink |  his confession was honest enough anyhow | poor fool | he's safe in hospital for a week and his friends if he has any and they know what it means will pray for that week to be prolonged |  what does it mean | dorothea managed to ask |  it means dartmoor | dorothea's candlestick shook in her hand and the extinguisher fell on the floor | her brother picked it up and restored it |  naturally he murmured with brotherly concern your nerves | it has been a trying night but you comported yourself admirably dorothea | ibbetson assures me he could not have tied the bandage better himself | i felt proud of my sister | he kissed her gallantly and pulled out his watch |  past twelve o'clock time they were round with the barouche | the sooner we get master raoul down to the infirmary and pack him in bed the better | as dorothea went up the stairs she heard the sound of wheels on the gravel | she could not accept his sacrifice | no a way must be found to save him and in her prayers that night she began to seek it | but while she prayed her heart was bowed over a great joy | she had a hero for a lover | chapter ix dorothea confesses she saw no more of him and heard very little before the court martial met | no one acquainted with the code of that age so strait laced in its proprieties so full blooded in its vices will need to be told that she never dreamed of asking her brother's permission to visit the prisoners' infirmary | he reported once a day perhaps and casually that the patient was doing well | dorothea ventured once to sound general rochambeau but the old aristocrat answered stiffly that he took no interest in d class s and plainly hinted that in his judgment m raoul had sinned past pardon which but added to her remorse | from time to time she obtained some hearsay news through polly but polly's chief interest now lay in her approaching marriage | for the commissary while accepting raoul's version of his capture had an intuitive gift which saved him from wholly believing in it | indeed his conduct of the affair if we consider the extent of his knowledge was nothing less than masterly | corporal zeally found himself a sergeant within forty eight hours and within an hour of the announcement he and polly were given an audience in the bayfield library with the result that parson milliton cried their banns in axcester church on the following sunday and the bride elect received a month's wages and three weeks' notice of dismissal with a hint that the reason for her short retention to instruct her successor in miss dorothea's ways was ostensible rather than real | with raoul's fate he declined to meddle |  here he said in effect is my report including the prisoner's confession | i do my simple duty in presenting it | but the young man was captured in my grounds he was known to be a prot g of my brother's | finding him wounded and faint with loss of blood we naturally did our best for him and this again renders me perhaps too sympathetic | the law is the law however and must take its course | no attitude could have been more proper or have shown better feeling | so raoul who made a rapid recovery barring the limp which he carried to the end of his days was tried condemned and sentenced in the space of two hours | he stuck to his story and the court had no alternative | dartmoor or stapleton inevitably awaited the prisoner who broke parole and was retaken | the night after his sentence raoul was marched past the bayfield gates under escort for dartmoor | and dorothea had not intervened | this of course proves that she was of no heroical fibre | she knew it | night after night she had lain awake vainly contriving plans for his deliverance and either she lacked inventiveness or was too honest for no method could she discover which avoided confession of the simple truth | as the days passed without catastrophe and without news save that her lover was bettering in hospital she staved off the truth trusting that the next night would bring inspiration | almost she hoped being quite unwise in such matters that his sufferings would be accepted as cancelling his offence | so she played the coward | the blow fell on the evening when endymion announced in casual tones that the court martial was fixed for the day after next | that night indeed brought something like an inspiration and on the morrow she rode into axcester and called upon polly now a bride of six days' standing and domiciled in one of the westcote cottages in church street a little beyond the bridge | for a call of state this was somewhat premature but it might pass | polly appeared to think it premature | her furniture was topsy turvy and her hair in curl papers she obviously did not expect visitors and resented this curtailment of the honeymoon | she showed it even when dorothea after apologies came straight to the point: polly i am very unhappy |  indeed miss |  you know that i must be since m raoul is going to that horrible war prison rather than let the truth be known |  but since you didn't encourage him miss of course i didn't encourage him to come said dorothea quickly |  why then it was his own fault and he broke his word by breaking bounds |  yes strictly his parole was broken but the meaning of parole is that a prisoner promises to make no attempt to escape | m raoul never dreamed of escaping yet that is the ground of his punishment |  well said polly if he chooses to say he was escaping i don't see how we i mean how you can help |  why by telling the truth and that's what we ought to do though it was wrong of him to expose us to it |  to be sure it was polly assented |  but urged dorothea couldn't we tell the truth of what happened without anyone's wanting to know more | he gave you a note which you took without guessing what it contained | he wished to have speech with me | before you could give me the note and i could refuse to see him as i should certainly have done he had arrived | his folly deserves punishment but no such punishment as being sent to dartmoor | polly eyed her ex mistress shrewdly |  have you burnt the note | she asked | dorothea blushing to the roots of her hair stammered: no i kept it it was evidence for him you see | i wish now she broke off as polly nodded her head |  i guessed you'd have kept it | and now you'll never make up your mind to burn it | you're too honest |  but surely the note itself would not be called for |  i don't know | folks ask curious questions in courts of law i've always heard | beggin' your pardon miss but your face tells too many tales and anyone but a fool would ask for that note before he'd been dealing with you three minutes | if he didn't he'd ask you what was in it | and then you'd be forced to tell lies which you couldn't to save your soul | dorothea knew this to be true | she reflected a moment |  i should decline to show it or to answer | mrs zeally thought it about time to assert herself |  very good miss | and now how about me | they'd ask me questions too and i'd have you consider miss dorothea that though not shaken down to it yet not as you might say in a state to expect callers or make them properly welcome i'm a respectable married woman | i don't mind confessing to you zeally isn't a comfortable man | he's pleased enough to be sergeant though he don't quite know how it came about and he's that sullen with brooding over it that for sixpence he'd give me the strap to ease his feelings | i ain't complaining | mr endymion chose to take me on the hop and hurry up the banns and i'm going to accommodate myself to the man | he's three parts of a fool and you needn't fear but i'll manage him | but i ain't for taking no risks and that i tell you fair | dorothea was stunned |  you don't mean to say that zeally suspects you |  why of course he does | said polly | prudence urged her to repeat that zeally was three parts of a fool but being nettled she spoke the words uppermost: who d'ee think he'd suspect | dorothea however was too desperately dejected to feel the prick of this shaft |  you will not help me then | was all her reply to it |  why no miss | if you put it in that point blank way | a married woman's got to think of her reputation first of all | polly's attitude might be selfish unfeeling but the fundamental incapacity for gratitude in girls of polly's class will probably surprise and pain their mistresses until the end of the world | after all polly was right | an attempt to clear raoul by telling the superficial truth must involve terrible risks and might at any turn enforce a choice between full confession and falsehood | dorothea could not bring herself to lie even heroically and there would be no heroism in lying to save herself | on the other hand the thought of a forced confession it might he before a tribunal was too hideous | no the suggestion had been a mad one and polly had rightly thrown cold water on it | also it had demanded too much of polly who could not be expected to jeopardise her matrimonial prospects to right a wrong for which she was not in truth responsible | dorothea loved a hero but knew she was no heroine | she called herself a pitiful coward unjustly because nurtured as she had been on the proprieties surrounded all her days by men and women of a class most sensitive to public opinion who feared the breath of scandal worse than a plague confession for her must mean a shame unspeakable |what  admit that she dorothea westcote had loved a french prisoner almost young enough to be her son | that she had given him audience at night | that he had been shot and captured beneath her window | unjustly too she accused herself because it is the decision not the terror felt in deciding which distinguishes the brave from the cowardly | if you doubt the event with dorothea the fault must be mine | she was timid but she came of a race which will endure anything rather than the conscious anguish of doing wrong | nor had her conscience needed them did it lack reminders | narcissus had been persuaded to send the drawings to london to be treated by lithography a process of which he knew nothing but to which m raoul during his studies in paris had given much attention and apparently not without making some discoveries unimportant perhaps and such as might easily reward an experimenter in an art not well past its infancy | at any rate he had drawn up elaborate instructions for the london firm of printers and when the proofs arrived with about a third of these instructions neglected and another third misunderstood narcissus was at his wits' end aghast at the poorness of the impressions yet not knowing in the least how to correct them | he gave dorothea no peace with them | evening after evening she was invited to pore upon the drawings over which she and her lover had bent together to criticise here and offer a suggestion there while every line revived a memory inflicted a pang | what suggestion could she find save the one which must not be spoken to send fetch the artist back from dartmoor and remedy all this with so much beside |  but urged narcissus you and he spent hours together | i quite understood that he had explained the process to you and on the strength of this i gave it too little attention | of course if one could have foreseen he broke off and added with some testiness: i'd give fifty pounds to have the fellow back if only for ten minutes' talk |  but why couldn't we | dorothea asked suddenly breathlessly | they were alone by the table under the bookcase | on the far side of the hall before the fire endymion dozed after a long day with the partridges | narcissus's words awoke a wild hope |  but why couldn't we | she repeated her voice scarcely louder than a whisper |  well that's an idea | he chuckled |  confound the fellow he imposed on all of us | if we had only guessed what he intended we might have signed a petition telling him how necessary he had made himself and imploring him for our sakes to behave like a gentleman |  but supposing supposing he was innocent that he had never meant she put out a hand to lay it on her brother's | hush  she could have cried but it was too late | endymion  narcissus called across the room jocosely | eh  what is it | endymion came out of his doze |  we're in a mess with these drawings a complete mess and we want master raoul fetched out of dartmoor to set us right | come now as commissary what'll you take to work it for us | fifty pounds has already been offered | dorothea turned from the table with a sigh for her lost chance |  he'd like it answered endymion grimly |  but my dear fellow he slewed himself in his chair for a look around the hall pray moderate your tones | i particularly deprecate levity on such matters within possible hearing of the servants that class of person never understands a joke | narcissus rubbed the top of his head a trick of his in perplexity |  but seriously: it has only this moment occurred to me | couldn't the drawings be conveyed to him in due form through the commandant of the prison | the poor fellow owes us no grudge | i believe he would be eager to do us this small service | and really they have made such a mess of the stones impossible | out of the question | and i may say now and once for all that the mention of that unhappy youth is repugnant to me | by good fortune we escaped being compromised by him and i have refrained from reminding you that your patronage of him was to say the least indiscreet |  god bless me | you don't suggest i hope that i encouraged him to escape |  i suggest nothing | but i am honestly glad to be quit of him and take some satisfaction in remembering that i detested the fellow from the first | he had too much cleverness with his bad style or if you prefer it was sufficiently like a gentleman to be dangerous |pah  for his particular offence i would have had the old hulks maintained in the hamoaze with all their severities as it is the posturer may find dartmoor pretty stiff but will yet have the consolation of herding with his betters | strangely enough this speech did more to fix dorothea's resolve than all she had read or heard of the rigours of the war prison | gently reared though she was physical suffering seemed to her less intolerable than to be unjustly held in this extreme of scorn this was the deeper wrong and putting herself in her lover's place feeling with his feelings she knew it to be by far the deeper | in dartmoor he shared the sufferings of men unfortunate but not despicable punished for fighting in their country's cause | but here was a moral punishment deserved by none but the vilest and she had helped to bring it was allowing it to rest upon a hero | in the long watches of that night it never occurred to her that the brutality of her brother's contempt was over done | and endymion not given to self questioning at any time was probably unconscious of a dull wrath revenging itself for many pin pricks of master raoul's clever tongue | endymion westcote like many pompous men usually hurt somebody when he indulged in a joke and for this cause perhaps had a nervous dislike of wit in others | dull in taking a jest but almost preternaturally clever in suspecting one he had disliked raoul's sallies in proportion as they puzzled him | the remembrance of them rankled and this had been his bull roar of revenge | he spent the next morning in his office and returning at three in the afternoon retired to the library to draw up the usual monthly report required of him as commissary | he had been writing tor an hour or more when dorothea tapped at the door and entered | endymion did not observe her pallor indeed he scarcely looked up | ah  you have come for a book | make as little noise then as possible that's a good soul | you interrupted me in a column of figures | he began to add them up afresh tapping the table with the fingers of his left hand as his custom was when counting | dorothea waited | the addition made he entered it resting three shapely finger tips on the table's edge for the number to be carried over |  i wish to speak with you particularly | he laid down his pen resignedly | her voice was urgent and he knew well enough that the occasion must be urgent when dorothea interrupted his work |  anything wrong |  it it's about m |raoul  his eyebrows went up but only to contract again upon a magisterial frown |  really after the request i was obliged to make to narcissus last night you were present i believe | is it possible that i failed to make plain my distaste |  ah but listen | it is no question of distaste but of a great wrong | madge retired early to prepare for her journey | mrs muir soon followed and her husband remarked that he would merely remain down long enough to write a note to graydon | this missive was brief but was charged with dynamite | on the morrow long before miss wildmere waked from the golden dreams which that day should realize madge and mr muir were on their way to the city | the young girl had said: don't let us do anything by halves | i have read that in the crisis of a battle timid measures are often fatal | let me give you everything that you can use as collateral | how much is there |  sixty thousand available at once | as i have said you shall have your own way |  well for once a woman is wiser than solomon | they went immediately to the trust company which had her property in keeping and having complied with the forms obtained the entire sum then parted on broadway to rendezvous at the train | mr muir gave the radiant girl a look which she valued more than the money | he then went to his bank | the official whom he accosted had been rather cold and shy of late but when he received the securities he grew perceptibly urbane | on reaching his office mr muir found that a transaction which had been greatly delayed was now consummated and that another ten thousand in cash was available | this also was sent to the bank at once | several business men were present when a confidential clerk from arnault appeared and asked for a private interview |  well really you must excuse me to day | i'm very busy and expect to leave town in an hour or two | please state what you have to say in few words or else i will see you next week |  mr arnault began the clerk in a metallic tone says that he is compelled to call in the loan he recently made you |  oh certainly certainly | have you the securities i gave him as collateral |  no sir but i can get them said the man |  do so and i will give you my check | thank mr arnault for the accommodation and say i have thirty or forty thousand to spare should he be hard pressed | be quick | the wall street men present looked at one another significantly and one of them remarked you are forehanded for these times muir |  if this absurd lack of confidence would only pass was the careless reply i should have more money on hand than i could invest profitably and then he appeared absorbed in other matters | arnault received the message from his clerk with something like dismay and turning on mr wildmere who was present he said almost savagely you have been misleading me |  indeed i have not sir not intentionally | i can't understand it |  well i can | muir is an old fox in business | i was a fool to think that a paltry thirty thousand would trouble him | well there is nothing to do but to close the matter up |  what in regard to my daughter | said mr wildmere inadvertently |  oh no confound it | what has she got to do with this affair | replied arnault with an irritation that he could not disguise |  i certainly have made miss wildmere a fair offer some would regard it as more | i shall go up to night and receive her answer as i promised | i am one who never fails in a promise to man or woman and i am ready to make good all that i have authorized you to say to your daughter and more |  let me add said mr wildmere with some assumption of dignity that as far as i have influence it is absolutely yours | i have ever prided myself on my fidelity to those who trust me |  thanks replied arnault with a little menacing coldness in his tone |  i hope i shall have proof of the fact this evening | if so all shall go swimmingly | poor wildmere bowed himself out with trepidation at heart and arnault followed him with a dark look muttering let them both beware | mr muir met madge at the depot and was quietly jubilant | both laughed heartily over the experiences of the day |  you are a blessed little woman madge | i was never so off my balance before in my life as i was last night | when confused and upset it is one of my impulses to stick to some principle of right like a mule | bless you i think i have secured you twice over | i have given you a lien on property worth two hundred thousand in ordinary times |  you have taught me to lean on you once more henry and that is worth more than all your other liens | mr arnault now appeared and came affably forward saying i am glad my enforced action did not incommode you to day |  thank you | i trust you are not in trouble mr arnault and there was a world of quiet satire in the remark |  oh no only a temporary need i assure you was the hasty reply |  so i supposed and as arnault turned away the speaker gave madge a humorous glance which made her look of demure innocence difficult to maintain |  graydon had enjoyed fair success in fishing and yet had not been supremely happy | he found with the venerated izaak walton that the gentle art was conducive to contemplation but there were certain phases in his situation that were not agreeable to contemplate | as he followed the trout stream amid the solitudes of nature the artificial and conventional in life grew less attractive | in spite of his efforts to the contrary miss wildmere seemed to represent just these phases | he recalled critically and dispassionately all the details of their past acquaintance and found with something like dismay that she had exhibited only the traits of a society belle that he could recall no new ideas or inspiring thoughts received from her | the apparent self sacrifice for her father which he had so unequivocally condemned was after all about the best thing he knew of her | the glamour of her beauty had been upon his eyes and he had credited her with corresponding graces of heart and mind | what evidence had he of their existence | the more he thought of it the more his pride also rebelled at the ignominious position in the background that he was compelled to take while the wall street diplomacy was prolonged | at last in anger and disgust he resolved that if he found arnault in his old position by stella's side he would withdraw at once and forever | after all although he was as yet unconscious of it the secret of his clarified vision was the influence of madge upon his mind | she seemed in harmony with every beautiful aspect of nature true and satisfying while ever changing | madge was right: the mountains streams rocks and trees became her allies suggesting her and not miss wildmere | he would have returned for the pleasure of her society but for his purpose not to appear again until arnault should have time to arrive from the city and resume his attentions | if they were received as in the past he would write to miss wildmere his withdrawal of further claims upon her thoughts | it was with something like bitter cynicism that he saw his illusions in regard to miss wildmere fade and when he drove up to the hotel after nightfall on saturday he was not sure that he cared much what her answer might be so apathetic had he become | the force of his old regard was not wholly spent but in his thoughts of her much that was repugnant to his feelings and ideals had presented itself to his mind and he felt that the giving up of his dream of lifelong companionship with her would almost bring a sense of relief | without pausing to analyze the reason of his eagerness to see madge and hear of her welfare he ran up at once to mrs muir's room |  madge went to new york | he echoed in surprise at mrs muir's information |  yes why not | she went to do some shopping for herself and me | miss wildmere's here and for a wonder mr arnault is not | what more could you ask |  hang mr arnault he had come near mentioning both in his irritation |  when will madge and henry arrive |  soon now on the nine o'clock train | oh by the way henry left a note for you |  very well | i'll go to my room dress and meet them |  he is asking after madge rather often it seems to me | she doesn't compare so very unfavorably with the speculator after all even in his eyes | on reaching his room he threw himself wearily into a chair and carelessly tore open his brother's note | instantly he bounded to his feet approached the light more closely and saw in his brother's unmistakable hand the following significant words: read this letter carefully and thoughtfully then destroy it | show your knowledge of its contents by neither word nor sign | be on your guard and permit no one to suspect financial anxieties | arnault and wildmere have struck me a heavy blow | the former has lent me money | i must raise a large sum in town but think i can do it even in the brief time permitted | if i cannot we lose everything | if i don't have to suspend to morrow miss wildmere will accept you in the evening | she has been waiting till those two precious confederates her father and arnault did their worst so that she could go over to the winning side | you are of course your own master but permit me as your brother affectionately and solemnly to warn you | stella wildmere will never bring you a day's happiness or peace | she loves herself infinitely more than you her father or any one else | be true to me and you shall share my fortunes | if you follow some insane notion of being true to her you will soon find you have been false to yourself | again i warn you | speak to no one of all this and give no sign of your knowledge |henry  graydon read this twice then crushed the paper in his hand as he muttered fool dupe idiot | now at last i understand her game and allusions | she was made to fear that henry was about to fail and she would not accept me until satisfied on this point | great god | my infatuation for her has been inciting arnault in these critical times to break my brother down and her father has been aiding and abetting in order that i might be removed out of the way | she was so false herself that she suspected her own father also arnault of deceiving her and so kept putting me off that she might learn the truth of their predictions or the result of their efforts | how clear it all becomes now that i have the key | well i should be worse than a heathen if i did not thank god for such an escape | chapter xxxii madge is matter of fact well i have come back to civilization and all its miseries thought graydon |  i was among scenes that know not wildmeres or arnaults | 'oh my prophetic soul '| i felt that there was something wrong in spite of her superb acting | sweet madge dear sister madge as you ever will be to me the more i think of it the more clearly i see that you are the one who first began to shatter my delusion | since that morning when i brought you home from your long vigil and you revealed to me your true brave heart stella wildmere has never seemed the same and the revolt of my nature has been growing ever since | his wish now was to avoid seeing every one until he had met his brother | while the thought of his escape was uppermost in his mind he was consumed with anxiety to learn the result of henry's efforts in town | his commercial instincts were also very strong and the thought of what might happen fairly made him tremble | he slipped down a back stairway and out into the darkness then bent his rapid steps to the depot at which he arrived half an hour before the train was due | remembering that excited pacing up and down there would not be very intelligent obedience to his brother's injunctions he started down a country road in the direction from which the train would come and paced to and fro in his strong excitement | at last the train arrived and his first glimpse of henry's face and madge's was reassuring | the moment the former saw him he called out hello graydon | have you a trout supper for us |  yes was the hearty response and he hastened forward and shook hands cordially saying in an aside oh madge | i am so glad to see you again |  you are | tell that to the marines | the length of your stay proves it to be a fish story |  here madge we'll put you in the stage | i'll rest myself by walking to the house with graydon |  henry you are all right | said graydon eagerly as soon as they were out of earshot |  yes was the quiet reply i raised the money paid arnault in full and have a good surplus in the bank |  thank heaven | how did you raise it | how has all this knowledge reached patience graydon patience | as soon as you are in the firm i shall have no secrets from you | until you are you must let me manage in my old way |  i have indeed little claim on your confidence | i have been deceived and have acted like a fool | but it's all over now | henry you may not believe me but my nonsense would have ended to night if i hadn't received your letter and all this had not occurred | i had been disgusted with this arnault business for some time and had let miss wildmere know my views | as i thought it over while away it all grew so detestable to me that i resolved if arnault appeared again and renewed his attentions i would never renew mine | he's here again as you may have seen |  oh yes and i have talked with him | please show no resentment | i obtained my information in a way unknown to him and there is nothing unusual in our transaction on its face | how was it that you began to grow critical toward miss wildmere |  well i don't mind telling you | there was not a ring of truth or a stamp of nobility about her words and manner and i have been associating with a girl who is truth itself and twice as clever and accomplished | miss wildmere was growing commonplace in contrast | i learned to love madge as a sister before she went away and now no man ever admired and loved a sister more | mr muir smiled broadly to himself in the darkness and said: truly graydon you are giving satisfactory proofs of returning sanity | we may as well conclude with the old saying 'all's well that ends well ' |  i think i had better go to town monday and resume business | it's time i did something to retrieve myself |  no graydon not yet | i have everything in hand now and believe the tide has turned | i realized ten thousand to day on a transaction that i will tell you about | i am not doing much business now only watching things and waiting | it was the suddenness of arnault's demand that worried me on saturday too you know | he had about the same as said that i might have the money as long as i wanted it and i should not have needed it much longer | in ordinary times i wouldn't have given it a thought |  you can help me more up here | it's growing warm and jack isn't improving as i would like | after what has occurred i don't wish mary and madge to meet these wildmeres any longer so i propose that you and madge go to the kaaterskill hotel on monday and explore | if you like the place then you can take mary and the children there | i've had a little scare in town and propose to realize on some more property and make myself perfectly safe | by going to a higher priced hotel we increase our credit also and add to the impression i made to day that we are in no danger | as the stage drew near the piazza graydon hastened forward to help madge out | in doing so he saw miss wildmere greeting arnault cordially | as he passed up the steps with madge he caught stella's swift appealing look at him | he only bowed politely and passed on | it was madge's triumphal entry now by the same door at which she had seen him enter with miss wildmere but a few weeks before | how complete her triumph was even madge did not yet know | while she went to her room he sought the office and ordered some of the trout he had caught to be prepared for supper | as he stood there miss wildmere left arnault's side and said mr muir are you not going to shake hands with me |  why certainly miss wildmere but there was little more than politeness in his tone and manner | as there were many coming and going she drew away with a reproachful glance |  so long as arnault is with me he will not be cordial was her thought | she looked around for her father but he nervous and apprehensive had disappeared | he felt that if he should be compelled to disclose the failure of his predictions she would pass into one of her sullen unmanageable moods | he feared that things were beyond his control and decided to let the young men manage for themselves | he was not however exceedingly solicitous | he hoped that arnault aided by the influence of his munificent offer would have the skill to push his suit to a prompt conclusion but he believed that if this suitor should be dismissed graydon would not fail his daughter and that all might yet end well for her and perhaps for himself | the supper room was again occupied by the late comers many of whom were accompanied by their families and friends | mr muir's quiet eyes fairly beamed over the group gathered at his table and he felt that but few moments of his life compared with those now passing | twenty four hours before he had seen himself drifting helplessly on a lee shore but a little hand had taken the helm when he had been paralyzed and now he saw clear sea room stretching away indefinitely with a turning tide and favoring gales | the terrible evils threatening him and his had been averted | the results of his lifework would not be swept away his idolized commercial standing could now be maintained his wife's brow remain unclouded by care his children be amply provided for graydon saved from a worse fate than financial disaster and last but not least the young fellow would be cured by madge of all future tendencies toward the wildmere type | he never could think of this hope without smiling to himself | he had at last obtained the explanation of madge's effort and success | by the superb result he measured the strength of the love which had led to it |  great scott |  his favorite expletive he had thought what a compass there is in her nature | i had long suspected her secret but when i touched upon it last night she made my blood tingle by her magnificent resentment | i would sooner have trifled with an enraged empress | look at her now smiling serene and although not in the least artful keeping all her secrets with consummate art | who would imagine that she was capable of such a volcanic outburst | if graydon does not lay siege to her now the name of the future firm should be henry muir and idiot | that sagacious young man did not appear at all blighted by the wreck of the hope he had cherished | he turned no wistful glances toward the girl who had so long satisfied his eyes and as he had believed his heart | he felt much the same as if he had been imposed upon by a cunning disguise | unknown to her he had caught a glimpse of what the mask concealed and his soul was shuddering at the deformities to which he had so nearly allied himself | her very beauty with its false promise had become hateful to him |  she is indeed a speculator he thought and i'm a little curious to see how she will continue her game | it afforded him vindictive amusement that she often yet furtively turned her eyes toward him as if he were still a factor in it | she never looked once in graydon's direction but that arnault was aware of the act | there was no longer any menace in his deportment toward her he was as devoted as the place and time would permit but in his eyes dwelt a vigilance and a resolution which should have given her warning | after supper mr and mrs muir found a comfortable nook on the piazza and the banker smoked his cigar with ineffable content |  do you feel too tired for a waltz madge | graydon asked |  the idea | when i've rested in the cars half a day |  oh madge | he whispered dear sweet little friend you know i mean sister only i dare not say it i'm so glad to be with you again | what makes you look so radiant to night | you look as though you had a world of happy thoughts behind those sparkling eyes |  nonsense graydon | you are always imagining things | i have youth good health have had my supper a trout supper too and i like to dance just as a bird enjoys flying |  you seem a bird of paradise | happy the man who coaxes you into his cage | brother or not when your beaux become too attentive they will find me a perfect dragon of a critic |  when i meet my ideal you shall have nothing to say |  i suppose not | i am at a loss to know where you will find him |  i shan't find him he must find me |  he will be an idiot if he doesn't | pardon me if i don't dance any more to night | i have had a long tramp over mountain paths followed by a long rough ride in a farmer's wagon and now have a very important act to perform before i sleep | as a proof of my fraternal i mean friendly confidence i will tell you what it is if you wish |  i don't propose to fail in any friendly obligations graydon she replied laughing as they strolled out into the summer night followed by miss wildmere's half desperate eyes | as they walked down a path graydon said take my arm the pavement is a little rough | dear madge you look divine to night | every time i see you my wonder increases at what you accomplished out on the pacific coast | that great boundless sparkling ocean has given you something of its own nature |  graydon you must be more sensible | when a fellow takes your arm you don't squeeze it against your side and say 'dear tom ' 'sweet dick ' or 'divine harry ' no matter how good friends they may be | friends don't indulge in sentimental far fetched compliments |  i certainly never did with any friends of mine | on this very walk you told me that you were not my sister and added 'there is no use in trying to ignore nature '| see how true this last assertion is proving now that i am again under your influence and so enjoy your society that i cannot ignore nature | during all those years when you were growing from childhood to womanhood i treated you as a sister thought of you as such | it was nature or rather the accord of two natures that formed and cemented the tie and not an accident of birth | even when you were an invalid and i was stupid enough to call you 'lackadaisical ' your presence always gave me pleasure | often when i had been out all the evening i would say with vexation 'i wish i had stayed at home with the little ghost '| how you used to order me about and tyrannize over me from your sofa when you were half child and half woman | i can say honestly madge it was never a bore to me for you had an odd piquant way of saying and doing things that always amused me your very weakness was an appeal to my strength and a claim upon it | you always appeared to have a sister's affection for me and your words and manner proved that i brought some degree of brightness into your shadowed life | in learning to love you as a sister in all those years wherein did i ignore nature | during my absence my feelings did not change in the least as i proved by my attempts at correspondence by my greeting when we met | then you perplexed and worried me more than you would believe and i imagined all sorts of ridiculous things about you but on that drive after your vigil with that poor dying girl i felt that i understood you fully at last | indeed ever since your rescue of the little wilder child from drowning my old feelings have been coming back with tenfold force | i can't help thinking of you of being proud of you | i give you my confidence to night just as naturally and unhesitatingly as if we had been rocked in the same cradle | i am not wearying you with this long explanation and preamble |  no graydon she replied in a low tone |  i am very glad | i don't think well of myself to night at all and i have a very humiliating confession to make one that i could make only to such a sister as you are or rather would have been were there a natural tie between us | i would not tell any tom dick and harry friends in the world what i shall now make known to you | if i didn't trust you so i wouldn't speak of it for what i shall say involves henry as well as myself | madge i've been duped i've been made both a fool and a tool and the consequences might have been grave indeed | henry who has so much quiet sagacity has in some way obtained information that proved of immense importance to him and absolutely vital to me | i shudder when i think of what might have happened and i am overwhelmed with gratitude when i think of my escape | i told you that miss wildmere was humoring that fellow arnault to save her father and consequently her mother and the child | this impression which was given me so skilfully and at last confirmed by plain words was utterly false | henry has been in financial danger wildmere knew it and he also knew that arnault had lent henry money which to day was called in with the hope of breaking him down | they would have succeeded too had he not had resources of which they knew nothing | you of course can't realize how essential a little ready money sometimes is in a period of financial depression but henry left a note which gave me an awful shock while at the same time it made clear miss wildmere's scheme | she had simply put me off that she might hear from wall street | if henry had failed she would have decided for arnault and i believe my attentions led to his tricky transaction that he loaned the money and called it in when he believed that henry could not meet his demand | i must be put out of his way for he reasoned justly that the girl would drop me if impoverished | thus indirectly i might have caused henry's failure a blow from which i should never have recovered | henry is safe now he assures me and oh madge thank god i have found her out before it was too late | i had fully resolved while oft trouting that i would break with her finally if i found arnault at her side again | now he may marry her for all i care and i wish him no worse punishment | i shall go to my room now and write to her that everything is over between us | the fact is madge you spoiled miss wildmere for me on that morning drive the other day | after leaving your society and going into hers i felt the difference keenly and while i should then have fulfilled the obligations which i had so stupidly incurred i had little heart in the affair | her acting was consummate but a true woman's nature had been revealed to me and the glamour was gone from the false one | now you see what absolute confidence i repose in you and how heavily this strange story bears against myself | could i have given it to any one for whom i had not a brother's love and in whom i did not hope to find a sister's gentle charity | i show you how unspent is the force of all those years when we had scarcely a thought which we could not tell each other | i have little claim though to be a protecting brother when i have been making such an egregious fool of myself | you have grown wiser and stronger than i you won't think very harshly of me will you madge |  no graydon |  and you won't condemn my fraternal affection as contrary to nature | she was sorely at a loss | she had listened with quickened breath a fluttering pulse and in a growing tumult of hope and fear to this undisguised revelation of his attitude toward her | she almost thought that she detected between the lines as it were the beginning of a different regard | he believed that he had been frankness itself and his words proved that he looked upon his fraternal affection and confidence as the natural the almost inevitable sequence of the past | she could not meet him on the fraternal ground that he was taking again nor did she wish him to occupy it in his own mind | to maintain the attitude which she had adopted would require as much delicacy as firmness of action or he would begin to query why she could not go back to their old relations as readily as he could | she had listened to the twice told tale of the events of the past few days with almost breathless interest because his words revealed the workings of his own mind and she had not the least intention of permitting him to settle down into the tranquil affection of a brother | while she hesitated he asked gently don't you feel a little of your old sisterly love for me |  no graydon i do not she replied boldly |  i suppose you will think me awfully matter of fact | i love mary as my sister i have the strongest esteem and affection for henry as my brother in law and i like you for just what you are to me neither more nor less | the truth is graydon when i woke up from my old limp shadowy life i had to look at everything just as it was and i have formed the habit of so doing | i think it is the best way | you did not see miss wildmere as she was but as you imagined her to be and you blame yourself too severely because you acted as you naturally would toward a girl for whom you had so high a regard | when we stick to the actual we escape mistakes and embarrassment | every one knows that we are not brother and sister every one would admit our right to be very good friends | i have listened to you with the deep and honest sympathy that is perfectly natural to our relations | i think the better of you for what you have told me but i'm too dreadfully matter of fact she concluded beginning to laugh to do anything more | he sighed deeply |  now there is no occasion for that sigh graydon | recall that morning drive to which you have alluded | what franker truer friendship could you ask than i gave evidence of then | come now be sensible | you live too much in the present moment and yield to your impulses | miss wildmere was a delusion and a snare but there are plenty of true women in the world | some day you will meet the right one | she won't object to your friends but she probably would to sisters who are not sisters | graydon laughed a little bitterly as he said so you imagine that after my recent experience i shall soon be making love to another girl |  why not | because miss wildmere is a fraud do you intend to spite yourself by letting some fair true girl pass by unheeded | that might be to permit the fraud to injure you almost as much as if she had married you | he burst out laughing as he exclaimed well your head is level |  certainly it is | my head is all right even though i have not much heart as you believe | i told you i could be a good fellow and i don't propose to indulge you in sentiment about what is past and gone natural and true as it was at the time or in cynicism for the future | i shall dance at your wedding and you won't be gray either | come the music has ceased and it must be almost sunday morning |  very well | on the day when you rightly boxed my ears and i asked you to make your own terms of peace i resolved to submit to everything and anything |  you don't 'stay put ' is the trouble | did i look and act so very cross that morning |  you looked magnificent and you spoke with such just eloquent indignation that you made my blood tingle | no my brave true friend i may say that mayn't i it was not a little thing for you to go away alone to fight so heroic a battle and achieve such a victory and madge i honor you with the best homage of my heart | you have taught me how to meet trouble when it comes | as they went up the steps arnault with a pale stern face and looking neither to the right nor to the left passed them and strode away | chapter xxxiii the end of diplomacy mr arnault's manner as he passed struck both graydon and madge as indicating strong feeling and stern purpose | in order to account for his action it is necessary to go back in our history for a short period | while madge was receiving such rich compensation for having become simply what she was miss wildmere had been gathering the rewards of diplomacy | as we have seen she had reached the final conclusion that if mr muir did not fail that day she would accept graydon at once and during its earlier hours she had been complacency itself feeling that everything was now in her own hands | mr muir's appearance and manner the previous evening had nearly convinced her that he was in no financial difficulties whatever that her father and mr arnault were either mistaken or else were deceiving her |  if the latter is the case she had thought they have so bungled as to enable me to test the truth of their words within twenty four hours |  i am virtually certain she said with an exultant smile that i shall be engaged to graydon muir before i sleep to night | in the afternoon it began to trouble her that graydon had not appeared | as the hours passed she grew anxious and with the shadow of night there fell a chill on her heart and hope | this passed into alarm when at last graydon arrived with his brother and madge and greeted her with the cold recognition that has been described | she had met mr arnault cordially at first because there were still possibilities in his favor but when her father promptly disappeared with the evident purpose to avoid questions and mr muir and his family at supper gave evidence of superb spirits instead of trouble she saw that she had been duped or in any case misled | her anger and worry increased momentarily especially since graydon beyond a little furtive observation completely ignored her | she naturally ascribed his course to resentment at her first greeting of arnault his continued presence at her side and the almost deferential manner with which he was treated by her father who had joined his family at supper when no queries could be made |  i'll prove to graydon by my manner that i am for him was her thought but he either did not or would not see her increasing coldness toward arnault | her purpose and tactics were all observed and thoroughly understood by the latter however but he gave few obvious signs of the fact | in his words tones compliments he proved that he was making good all that he had promised but the changing expression in his eyes grew so ominous that mr wildmere saw his suppressed anger with alarm | miss wildmere felt sure that before the evening was over she could convey to graydon her decision and chafed every moment over the leisurely supper that mr arnault persisted in making especially as she saw that it was not his appetite that detained him | the muir group had passed out and to leave him and her father would not only be an act of rudeness but also would appear like open pursuit of graydon | when at last she reached the parlor to decline arnault's invitation to dance would be scarcely less than an insult yet with intensifying anger and fear she saw that circumstances were compelling her to appear as if she had disregarded graydon's warnings and expectations | so far from being dismissed arnault was the one whom she had first greeted and to whom she was now giving the evening | while she was dancing with arnault graydon with madge appeared upon the floor | she was almost reckless in her efforts to secure his attention | in this endeavor she did not fail but she failed signally in winning any recognition and the ill concealed importunity of her eyes hastened graydon's departure with madge and gave time for the long interview described in the previous chapter | she grew cold with dread | it was the impulse of her self pleasing nature to want that most which seemed the most denied and she reasoned he is angry because arnault is at my side as usual in spite of all he said | he is determined to bring me to a decision and won't approach me at arnault's side | yet i dare not openly shake arnault off and he's so attentive that i must do it openly if at all | graydon's manner was so very strange and cold that i feel that i should do something to conciliate him at once and yet how can i when arnault is bent upon monopolizing the whole evening | he gives me no chance to leave him unless i am guilty of the shameful rudeness of telling him to leave me | oh if i could only see graydon alone even for a moment | arnault was indeed a curious study and yet he was acting characteristically | he had virtually given up hope of ever winning stella wildmere | he had wooed devotedly offered wealth and played his final card and in each had failed | when he left the city he still had hope that his promise of immediate wealth and mr wildmere's necessity and influence might turn the scale in his favor and he believed that having secured her decision she as a woman of the world would grow content and happy in the future that he could provide for her | but be his fate what it might both his pride and his peculiar sense of honor made it imperative that he should be her suitor until the time stipulated for his answer should expire | up to twelve o'clock that night he would not give her the slightest cause for resentment or even complaint | then his obligation to her ceased utterly and she knew that it would | he had been irritated and despondent ever since mr muir through madge's aid had so signally checkmated him | but stella's greeting had reassured him and graydon's manner toward her gave the impression that she had not been extending encouragement to him | this promising aspect of affairs speedily began to pass away however when he saw her step to graydon's side and ask if he was not going to shake hands with her | he knew how proud the girl was and by this high standard measured the strength of the regard which impelled to this advance | he had since noted every effort that she had made to secure graydon's attention and the truth became perfectly clear | she had utterly lost faith in his and her father's predictions of financial disaster to henry muir and would accept graydon at the earliest opportunity | he saw that his defeat in wall street insured his defeat in the catskills and feared that graydon had guessed his strategy and therefore would not approach the girl while he was at her side | there was no use in his playing lover any longer he had no desire to do so for even he now so clearly recognized the mercenary spirit which might have brought her to his arms that such manhood as he had revolted at it | if she had given him her hand it would have been secured purely through a financial trick and even his wall street soul experienced a revulsion of disgust at the thought of a wife thus obtained | if he could have detected a little sentiment toward him some kindly regret that she could not reward his long continued and unstinted devotion he would have parted from her more in sorrow than in anger but now he knew that she was wild to escape from him that she would instantly break her promise not to accept muir before the close of the week and to his punctilious business mind the week did not end until twelve o'clock saturday night | with a sort of grim vindictiveness he had muttered she shall keep her promise | neither she nor muir shall be happy till my time has expired | later in the evening graydon not returning the thought occurred to arnault perhaps he too has recognized the sharp game she has played perhaps henry muir has said to him 'she has been putting you off to see the result of the sudden calling in of arnault's loan ' and now young muir proposes to console himself with that handsome miss alden and a gleam of pleasure at the prospect illumined his face for a moment | meanwhile he maintained his mask before the world so admirably that even miss wildmere little guessed the depth of his revolt | he was the last one to reveal his bitter disappointment and humiliating defeat to the vigilant gossips of the house | those who saw his smiling face and gallantries and heard his breezy half cynical words little guessed the storm within | he had been taught in the best school in the world how to say and look one thing and mean another | at last an acquaintance approached and said pardon me mr arnault but i don't propose to permit you to monopolize miss wildmere all the evening and then asked for the next dance | stella complied instantly thinking graydon may return now at any moment and if he sees that i am not with arnault will come to me as usual | arnault bowed politely looked at his watch and invited another lady to dance | stella had been on the floor but a few moments when not graydon but her father came and said to her partner excuse me sir | i wish to speak to my daughter | requesting her companion to wait she followed mr wildmere through an open window and when on the piazza he took her hand and put it within his arm with a firmness that permitted no resistance | arnault noted the proceeding with a cynical smile |  stella said her father in a low stern tone did you not promise mr arnault his answer this evening |  answer my question first she replied bitterly |  did henry muir fail to day | of course he did not | you have been deceiving me |  i did not deceive you i was mistaken myself | but i warn you | graydon muir is not at your side | he may not return | arnault is waiting to give you wealth and me safety but he may not wait much longer | you are taking worse risks than i ever incurred in the street and your loss may be greater than any i have met with | bah  she replied in anger |  i might have been engaged to graydon muir this moment had i not listened to your croakings | i'll manage for myself now and she broke away and joined her partner again | after the dance was over she said suppose we walk on the piazza i'm warm | she was cold and trembling | arnault took his stand in the main hall where he and she could see the clock should she approach him again | the last hour was rapidly passing | miss wildmere and her attendant strolled leisurely the whole length of the piazza but graydon was not to be seen | then she led him through a hall whence she could glance into the reception and reading rooms | the quest was futile and she passed arnault unheedingly into the parlor saying that she was tired and with her companion sat down where they could be seen from the doorway and windows | but he thought her singularly distraite in her effort to maintain conversation |  oh she thought he will come soon he must come soon | i must i must see him before i retire | arnault meantime maintained his position in the hall chatting and laughing with an acquaintance | what's his name |  well if you must know i'm walking out with corporal zeally | but what are you doing to the book | for m raoul had taken out a penknife and was slicing out page after page in some places whole blocks of pages together |  when i've finished i'm going to ask you to take it back to your mistress and then no doubt you'll be reading it on the sly | here i must sit down: suppose you let me perch myself on the top bar of the gate | also it would be kind of you to put up an arm and prevent my overbalancing | those whom the beauty of the night had lured without were straggling in the man at her side was growing curious and interested and he determined to maintain his position as long as she would | he was detained but little longer | the clock soon chimed midnight | arnault gave her a brief cold look turned on his heel and went out passing graydon and madge who were at that moment ascending the steps |  oh pardon me said miss wildmere fairly trembling with dread i had no idea it was so late | and she bowed her companion away instantly | at that moment she saw graydon entering and she went to the parlor door but he passed her without apparent notice and bade madge a cordial good night at the foot of the stairs | as he was turning away miss wildmere was at his side |  mr muir graydon she said in an eager tone i wish to speak with you | he bowed very politely and answered in a voice that she alone could hear you will receive a note from me at your room within half an hour | then bowing again he walked rapidly away | she saw from his grave face and unsympathetic eyes that she had lost him | half desperate and with the instinct of self preservation she passed out on the piazza to bid arnault good night as she tried to assure herself with pallid lips but ready then at last to take any terms from him | arnault was not to be seen | after a moment her father stepped to her side and said: stella it is late | you had better retire |  i wish to say good night to mr arnault she faltered |  mr arnault has gone |  gone where | she gasped |  i don't know | as the clock struck twelve he came rapidly out and walked away | he passed by me but would not answer when i spoke to him | come let me take you to your room | with a chill at heart almost like that of death she went with him and sat down pale and speechless | in a few moments a note was brought to mr wildmere's door and he took it to his daughter | she could scarcely open it with her nerveless fingers and when she read the brief words miss wildmere you must permit me to renounce all claims upon you now and forever | memory and your own thoughts will reveal to you the obvious reasons for my action graydon muir she found a brief respite from the results of her diplomacy in unconsciousness | chapter xxxiv broken lights and shadows mr wildmere looked almost ten years older when he came down to what he supposed would be a solitary breakfast but something like hope and gladness reappeared on his haggard face when he saw arnault at his table as usual | he scarcely knew how he would be received but arnault was as affable and courteous as he would have been months previous and no one in the breakfast room would have imagined that anything had occurred to disturb the relations between the two gentlemen | he inquired politely after the ladies expressed regret that they were indisposed and changed the subject in a tone and manner natural to a mere acquaintance | although his courtesy would appear faultless to observers it made wildmere shiver |  mr arnault mr wildmere said a little nervously as they left the breakfast room may i speak with you |  certainly replied arnault with cool politeness and he followed mr wildmere to a deserted part of the piazza |  you made a very kind and liberal offer to my daughter the latter began |  and received my final answer last night was the cold decisive reply |  it would be impossible to imagine more definite assurance that miss wildmere has no regard for me than was given within the time i stipulated | i have accepted such assurance as final | good morning sir and with a polite bow he turned on his heel and went to his room | mr wildmere afterward learned that he took the first train to new york |  arnault has a clear field now graydon had thought cynically while at breakfast |  i can scarcely wish him anything worse than success and then he looked complacently around the family group to which he belonged and felicitated himself that wildmere traits were conspicuously absent | his eyes dwelt oftenest on madge | at this early meal she always made him think of a flower with the morning dew upon it | even her evening costumes were characterized by quiet elegance but during the earlier hours of the day she dressed with a simplicity that was almost severe and yet with such good taste such harmony with herself that the eye of the observer was always rested and satisfied | gentlemen who saw her would rarely fail to speak about her afterward few would ever mention her dress | miss wildmere affected daintiness and style madge sought in the most quiet and modest way to emphasize her own individuality | as far as possible she wished to be valued for what she actually was | the very fact that there was so much in her life that must be hidden led to a strong distaste for all that was misleading in non essentials |  i am going to church with you to day said graydon and i shall try to behave |  try to | you cannot sit with me unless you promise to behave |  that is the way to talk to men said mrs muir who was completely under her husband's thumb |  they like you all the better for showing some spirit |  i am not trying to make graydon like me better but only to insure that he spends sunday as should a good american |  there is no longer any 'better' about my liking for madge | it's all best | i admit however that she has so much spirit that she inspires unaffected awe |  a roundabout way of calling me awful |  since you won't ride or drive with me to day are you too 'awfully good ' as harry says to take a walk after dinner |  it depends on how you behave in church | they spent the afternoon in a very different manner however for soon after breakfast dr sommers told them that tilly wendall was at rest and that the funeral would be that afternoon | with dr sommers's tidings graydon saw that a shadow had fallen on madge's face and his manner at once became gravely and gently considerate | there were allusions to the dead girl in the service at the chapel where she had been an attendant and graydon saw half shed tears in madge's eyes more than once | she drove out with him in the lovely summer afternoon to the gray old farmhouse | the thoughts of each were busy they had not much to say to each other and madge was grateful for his quiet consideration for her mood | it was another proof that the man she loved had not a shallow coarse fibred nature | with all his strength he could be a gentle sympathetic presence thinking of her first thoughtfully respecting her unspoken wishes and not a garrulous egotist | he in turn wondered at his own deep content and at the strange and unexpected turn that his affairs had taken | he not only dwelt on what had happened but on what might have happened what he had hoped for and sought to attain | he remembered with shame that he had even wished that madge had not been at the resort so that he might be less embarrassed in his suit to miss wildmere | from his first waking moment in the morning he had been conscious of an immeasurable sense of relief at his escape | he felt now that he had never deeply loved miss wildmere that she had never touched the best feelings of his heart because not capable of doing so | but he had admired her | he had been a devotee of society and she had been to him the beautiful culmination of that phase of life | he saw he had endowed her with the womanly qualities which would make her the light of a home as well as of the ballroom but he had also seen that the woman which his fancy had created did not exist | there is a love which is the result of admiration and illusion and this will often cling to its imperfect object to the end | such was not the case with graydon however | his first motive had been little more than an ambition to seek the most brilliant of social gems with which to crown a successful life but he was too much of a man to marry a belle as such and be content | he must love her as a woman also and he had loved what he imagined stella wildmere to be | now he felt however like a lapidary who while gloating over a precious stone is suddenly shown that it is worthless paste | he may have valued it highly an hour before now he throws it away in angry disgust | but this simile only in part explains graydon's feelings | he not only recognized miss wildmere's mercenary character and selfish spirit but also the power she would have had to thwart his life and alienate him from his brother and madge | while she was not the pearl for which he might give all she could easily have become the active poison of his life |  oh he thought how blessed is this content with sweet sister madge sister in spite of all she says compared with brief feverish pleasure in an engagement with such a sham of a woman or the mad chaos of financial disaster which my suit might have brought about | and he unconsciously gave a profound sigh of satisfaction |  oh graydon what a sigh | madge exclaimed |  is your regret so great | you were indeed thinking very deeply |  so were you madge so you have been during the last half hour | my sigh was one of boundless relief and gratitude | if you will permit me i will tell you the thoughts that occasioned it as a proof of my friendly confidence | may i tell you |  yes if you think it right she said with slightly heightened color |  it seems to me both right and natural that i should tell you and he put the thoughts which preceded his sigh into words |  yes she replied gravely i think you have escaped much that you would regret | please don't talk about it any more |  what were you thinking about madge | he asked looking into her flushed and lovely face |  i have thought a great deal about tilly and what passed between us | that is the house there and it will always remain in my mind as a distinct memory | farm wagons and vehicles of all descriptions were gathering at the dwelling | they were driven by men with faces as rugged and weather beaten as the mountains around them | by their sides were plain featured matrons whose rustic beauty had early faded under the stress of life's toil and apple cheeked boys and girls with faces composed into the most unnatural and portentous gravity | there was a sprinkling of young men with visages so burned by the sun that they might pass for civilized indians | they were accompanied by young women who in their remote rural homes had obtained hints from the world of fashion and after the manner of american girls had arrayed themselves with a neatness and taste that was surprising and the fresh pink and white of their complexions made a pleasing contrast with their swains | although the occasion was one of solemnity it was not without its pleasurable excitement | they all knew about poor tilly and to day was the culmination of the little drama of her illness the details of which had been discussed for weeks among the neighbors not in callous curiosity but with that strange blending of gossip and sympathy which is found in rural districts | the conclusion of all such talk had been a sigh and the words she is prepared to go | the people as yet were gathered without the door and in groups under the trees | tilly's remains were still in her own little room mrs wendall taking her farewell look with hollow tearless eyes | a few favored ones chiefly the watchers who had aided the stricken mother were admitted to this retreat of sorrow | when dr sommers saw madge and graydon he came to them and said mrs wendall requested that when you came you and whoever accompanied you should be brought to her | tilly before she died expressed the wish that you should sit with her mother during the funeral | no no mr muir mrs wendall would have no objection to any of miss alden's friends | i can give you a seat here by this window | the other rooms will be very crowded with those who are strangers to you | graydon found himself by the same window at which madge had sat in her long vigil | the bed had been removed and in its place was a plain yet tasteful casket | mr wendall with his head bowed down sat at its foot wiping away tears from time to time with a bandana handkerchief | two or three stanch friends and helpers sat also in the room for it would appear that the wendalls had no relatives in the vicinity | as madge sat down by mrs wendall so intent was the mother's gaze upon her dead child that she did not at first notice the young girl's presence | madge took a thin toil worn hand caressingly in both her own and then the tearless eyes were turned upon her and the light of recognition came slowly into them as if she were recalling her thoughts from an immense distance |  i'm glad you've come she said in a loud strange whisper |  she wanted you to be with me | she said you had trouble and would know how to sustain me | she left a message for you | she said 'tell dear madge that the dying sometimes have clear vision tell her i've prayed for her ever since and she'll be happy yet even in this world | tell her that i only saw her a little while but she belongs to those i shall wait for to welcome '| you'll stay by me till it's all over won't you | madge was deeply agitated but she managed to say distinctly tilly also said something to me and i want you to think of her words through all that is to come | she said 'think where i have gone and don't grieve a moment ' |  yes i'll come to that by and by but now i can think of only one thing they are going to take away my baby and she laid her head on the still bosom with a yearning in her face which only god who created the mother's heart could understand | what followed need not be dwelt upon | the mother and father took their last farewell the casket was carried to the outer room the simple service was soon over the tearful tributes paid and then the slow procession took its way to a little graveyard on a hillside among the mountains |  i can't go and see tilly buried said mrs wendall in the same unnatural whisper |  i will go to her grave some day but not yet | i am trying to keep up but i don't feel that i could stand on my feet a minute now |  i'll stay with you till they come back madge answered tenderly and at last she was left alone in the house holding the tearless mother's hand | she soon bowed her young head upon it bedewing it with her tears | the poor woman's deep absorption began to pass away | the warm tears upon her hand the head upon her lap began to waken the instincts of womanhood to help and console another | she stroked the dark hair and murmured poor child poor child | tilly was right | trouble makes us near of kin |  you loved tilly mrs wendall madge sobbed |  think of where she's gone | no more tears no more pain no more death | her touch of sympathy broke the stony paralysis her hot tears melted those which seemed to have congealed in the breaking heart and the mother took madge in her arms and cried till her strength was gone | when mr wendall returned with some of the neighbors madge met him at the door and held up a warning finger | the overwrought woman had been soothed into the blessed oblivion of restoring sleep the first she had for many hours | a motherly looking woman whispered her intention of remaining with mrs wendall all night | mr wendall took madge's hand in both his own and looked at her with eyes dim with tears | twice he essayed to speak then turned away faltering when i meet you where tilly is perhaps i can tell you | she went down the little path bordered by flowers which the dead girl had loved and tended and gathered a few of them | then graydon drove her away his only greeting being a warm pressure of her hand | at last madge breathed softly think where i have gone | where is heaven | what is it | his eyes were moist as he turned toward her |  i don't know madge he said |  i know one thing however i shall never as you asked say a word against your faith | i've seen its fruits to day | chapter xxxv a new experiment stella wildmere would not leave the seclusion of her room | as the hours passed the more overwhelming grew her disappointment and humiliation and her chief impulse now was to get away from a place that had grown hateful to her | the colony is neutral ground the only ground where as in church the upper rank and the townsfolk of the place can meet | here fired by a word a look or gesture are started those feuds between house and house between a woman of rank and a citizen's wife which endure till death and widen the impassable gulf which parts the two classes of society | with the exception of the clermont mont saint jean the beauffremont the de scey and the gramont families with a few others who come only to stay on their estates in the comte the aristocracy of besancon dates no further back than a couple of centuries the time of the conquest by louis xiv | this little world is essentially of the parlement and arrogant stiff solemn uncompromising haughty beyond all comparison even with the court of vienna for in this the nobility of besancon would put the viennese drawing rooms to shame | as to victor hugo nodier fourier the glories of the town they are never mentioned no one thinks about them | the marriages in these families are arranged in the cradle so rigidly are the greatest things settled as well as the smallest | no stranger no intruder ever finds his way into one of these houses and to obtain an introduction for the colonels or officers of title belonging to the first families in france when quartered there requires efforts of diplomacy which prince talleyrand would gladly have mastered to use at a congress | in 1834 amedee was the only man in besancon who wore trouser straps this will account for the young man's being regarded as a lion | and a little anecdote will enable you to understand the city of besancon | some time before the opening of this story the need arose at the prefecture for bringing an editor from paris for the official newspaper to enable it to hold its own against the little gazette dropped at besancon by the great gazette and the patriot which frisked in the hands of the republicans | paris sent them a young man knowing nothing about la franche comte who began by writing them a leading article of the school of the charivari | the chief of the moderate party a member of the municipal council sent for the journalist and said to him you must understand monsieur that we are serious more than serious tiresome we resent being amused and are furious at having been made to laugh | be as hard of digestion as the toughest disquisitions in the revue des deux mondes and you will hardly reach the level of besancon | the editor took the hint and thenceforth spoke the most incomprehensible philosophical lingo | his success was complete | if young monsieur de soulas did not fall in the esteem of besancon society it was out of pure vanity on its part the aristocracy were happy to affect a modern air and to be able to show any parisians of rank who visited the comte a young man who bore some likeness to them | all this hidden labor all this dust thrown in people's eyes this display of folly and latent prudence had an object or the lion of besancon would have been no son of the soil | amedee wanted to achieve a good marriage by proving some day that his farms were not mortgaged and that he had some savings | he wanted to be the talk of the town to be the finest and best dressed man there in order to win first the attention and then the hand of mademoiselle rosalie de watteville | in 1830 at the time when young monsieur de soulas was setting up in business as a dandy rosalie was but fourteen | hence in 1834 mademoiselle de watteville had reached the age when young persons are easily struck by the peculiarities which attracted the attention of the town to amedee | there are so many lions who become lions out of self interest and speculation | the wattevilles who for twelve years had been drawing an income of fifty thousand francs a year did not spend more than four and twenty thousand francs a year while receiving all the upper circle of besancon every monday and friday | on monday they gave a dinner on friday an evening party | thus in twelve years what a sum must have accumulated from twenty six thousand francs a year saved and invested with the judgment that distinguishes those old families | it was very generally supposed that madame de watteville thinking she had land enough had placed her savings in the three per cents in 1830 | rosalie's dowry would therefore as the best informed opined amount to about twenty thousand francs a year | so for the last five years amedee had worked like a mole to get into the highest favor of the severe baroness while laying himself out to flatter mademoiselle de watteville's conceit | madame de watteville was in the secret of the devices by which amedee succeeded in keeping up his rank in besancon and esteemed him highly for it | soulas had placed himself under her wing when she was thirty and at that time had dared to admire her and make her his idol he had got so far as to be allowed he alone in the world to pour out to her all the unseemly gossip which almost all very precise women love to hear being authorized by their superior virtue to look into the gulf without falling and into the devil's snares without being caught | do you understand why the lion did not allow himself the very smallest intrigue | he lived a public life in the street so to speak on purpose to play the part of a lover sacrificed to duty by the baroness and to feast her mind with the sins she had forbidden to her senses | a man who is so privileged as to be allowed to pour light stories into the ear of a bigot is in her eyes a charming man | if this exemplary youth had better known the human heart he might without risk have allowed himself some flirtations among the grisettes of besancon who looked up to him as a king his affairs might perhaps have been all the more hopeful with the strict and prudish baroness | to rosalie our cato affected prodigality he professed a life of elegance showing her in perspective the splendid part played by a woman of fashion in paris whither he meant to go as depute | all these manoeuvres were crowned with complete success | in 1834 the mothers of the forty noble families composing the high society of besancon quoted monsieur amedee de soulas as the most charming young man in the town no one would have dared to dispute his place as cock of the walk at the hotel de rupt and all besancon regarded him as rosalie de watteville's future husband | there had even been some exchange of ideas on the subject between the baroness and amedee to which the baron's apparent nonentity gave some certainty | mademoiselle de watteville to whom her enormous prospective fortune at that time lent considerable importance had been brought up exclusively within the precincts of the hotel de rupt which her mother rarely quitted so devoted was she to her dear archbishop and severely repressed by an exclusively religious education and by her mother's despotism which held her rigidly to principles | rosalie knew absolutely nothing | is it knowledge to have learned geography from guthrie sacred history ancient history the history of france and the four rules all passed through the sieve of an old jesuit | dancing and music were forbidden as being more likely to corrupt life than to grace it | the baroness taught her daughter every conceivable stitch in tapestry and women's work plain sewing embroidery netting | at seventeen rosalie had never read anything but the lettres edifiantes and some works on heraldry | no newspaper had ever defiled her sight | she attended mass at the cathedral every morning taken there by her mother came back to breakfast did needlework after a little walk in the garden and received visitors sitting with the baroness until dinner time | then after dinner excepting on mondays and fridays she accompanied madame de watteville to other houses to spend the evening without being allowed to talk more than the maternal rule permitted | at eighteen mademoiselle de watteville was a slight thin girl with a flat figure fair colorless and insignificant to the last degree | her eyes of a very light blue borrowed beauty from their lashes which when downcast threw a shadow on her cheeks | a few freckles marred the whiteness of her forehead which was shapely enough | her face was exactly like those of albert durer's saints or those of the painters before perugino the same plump though slender modeling the same delicacy saddened by ecstasy the same severe guilelessness | everything about her even to her attitude was suggestive of those virgins whose beauty is only revealed in its mystical radiance to the eyes of the studious connoisseur | she had fine hands though red and a pretty foot the foot of an aristocrat | she habitually wore simple checked cotton dresses but on sundays and in the evening her mother allowed her silk | the cut of her frocks made at besancon almost made her ugly while her mother tried to borrow grace beauty and elegance from paris fashions for through monsieur de soulas she procured the smallest trifles of her dress from thence | rosalie had never worn a pair of silk stockings or thin boots but always cotton stockings and leather shoes | on high days she was dressed in a muslin frock her hair plainly dressed and had bronze kid shoes | this education and her own modest demeanor hid in rosalie a spirit of iron | physiologists and profound observers will tell you perhaps to your astonishment that tempers characteristics wit or genius reappear in families at long intervals precisely like what are known as hereditary diseases | thus talent like the gout sometimes skips over two generations | we have an illustrious example of this phenomenon in george sand in whom are resuscitated the force the power and the imaginative faculty of the marechal de saxe whose natural granddaughter she is | the decisive character and romantic daring of the famous watteville had reappeared in the soul of his grand niece reinforced by the tenacity and pride of blood of the rupts | but these qualities or faults if you will have it so were as deeply buried in this young girlish soul apparently so weak and yielding as the seething lavas within a hill before it becomes a volcano | madame de watteville alone perhaps suspected this inheritance from two strains | she was so severe to her rosalie that she replied one day to the archbishop who blamed her for being too hard on the child leave me to manage her monseigneur | i know her | she has more than one beelzebub in her skin | the baroness kept all the keener watch over her daughter because she considered her honor as a mother to be at stake | after all she had nothing else to do | clotilde de rupt at this time five and thirty and as good as widowed with a husband who turned egg cups in every variety of wood who set his mind on making wheels with six spokes out of iron wood and manufactured snuff boxes for everyone of his acquaintance flirted in strict propriety with amedee de soulas | when this young man was in the house she alternately dismissed and recalled her daughter and tried to detect symptoms of jealousy in that youthful soul so as to have occasion to repress them | she imitated the police in its dealings with the republicans but she labored in vain | rosalie showed no symptoms of rebellion | then the arid bigot accused her daughter of perfect insensibility | rosalie knew her mother well enough to be sure that if she had thought young monsieur de soulas nice she would have drawn down on herself a smart reproof | thus to all her mother's incitement she replied merely by such phrases as are wrongly called jesuitical wrongly because the jesuits were strong and such reservations are the chevaux de frise behind which weakness takes refuge | then the mother regarded the girl as a dissembler | if by mischance a spark of the true nature of the wattevilles and the rupts blazed out the mother armed herself with the respect due from children to their parents to reduce rosalie to passive obedience | this covert battle was carried on in the most secret seclusion of domestic life with closed doors | the vicar general the dear abbe grancey the friend of the late archbishop clever as he was in his capacity of the chief father confessor of the diocese could not discover whether the struggle had stirred up some hatred between the mother and daughter whether the mother were jealous in anticipation or whether the court amedee was paying to the girl through her mother had not overstepped its due limits | being a friend of the family neither mother nor daughter confessed to him | rosalie a little too much harried morally about young de soulas could not abide him to use a homely phrase and when he spoke to her trying to take her heart by surprise she received him but coldly | this aversion discerned only by her mother's eyes was a constant subject of admonition |  rosalie i cannot imagine why you affect such coldness towards amedee | is it because he is a friend of the family and because we like him your father and i |  well mamma replied the poor child one day if i made him welcome should i not be still more in the wrong |  what do you mean by that | cried madame de watteville |  what is the meaning of such words | your mother is unjust no doubt and according to you would be so in any case | never let such an answer pass your lips again to your mother and so forth | this quarrel lasted three hours and three quarters | rosalie noted the time | her mother pale with fury sent her to her room where rosalie pondered on the meaning of this scene without discovering it so guileless was she | thus young monsieur de soulas who was supposed by every one to be very near the end he was aiming at all neckcloths set and by dint of pots of patent blacking an end which required so much waxing of his moustaches so many smart waistcoats wore out so many horseshoes and stays for he wore a leather vest the stays of the lion amedee i say was further away than any chance comer although he had on his side the worthy and noble abbe de grancey |  madame said monsieur de soulas addressing the baroness while waiting till his soup was cool enough to swallow and affecting to give a romantic turn to his narrative one fine morning the mail coach dropped at the hotel national a gentleman from paris who after seeking apartments made up his mind in favor of the first floor in mademoiselle galard's house rue du perron | then the stranger went straight to the mairie and had himself registered as a resident with all political qualifications | finally he had his name entered on the list of the barristers to the court showing his title in due form and he left his card on all his new colleagues the ministerial officials the councillors of the court and the members of the bench with the name 'albert savaron ' |  the name of savaron is famous said mademoiselle de watteville who was strong in heraldic information |  the savarons of savarus are one of the oldest noblest and richest families in belgium |  he is a frenchman and no man's son replied amedee de soulas |  if he wishes to bear the arms of the savarons of savarus he must add a bar sinister | there is no one left of the brabant family but a mademoiselle de savarus a rich heiress and unmarried |  the bar sinister is of course the badge of a bastard but the bastard of a comte de savarus is noble answered rosalie |  enough that will do mademoiselle | said the baroness |  you insisted on her learning heraldry said monsieur de watteville and she knows it very well |  go on i beg monsieur de soulas |  you may suppose that in a town where everything is classified known pigeon holed ticketed and numbered as in besancon albert savaron was received without hesitation by the lawyers of the town | they were satisfied to say 'here is a man who does not know his besancon | who the devil can have sent him here | what can he hope to do | sending his card to the judges instead of calling in person | what a blunder '| and so three days after savaron had ceased to exist | he took as his servant old monsieur galard's man galard being dead jerome who can cook a little | albert savaron was all the more completely forgotten because no one had seen him or met him anywhere |  then does he not go to mass | asked madame de chavoncourt |  he goes on sundays to saint pierre but to the early service at eight in the morning | he rises every night between one and two in the morning works till eight has his breakfast and then goes on working | he walks in his garden going round fifty or perhaps sixty times then he goes in dines and goes to bed between six and seven |  how did you learn all that | madame de chavoncourt asked monsieur de soulas |  in the first place madame i live in the rue neuve at the corner of the rue du perron i look out on the house where this mysterious personage lodges then of course there are communications between my tiger and jerome |  and you gossip with babylas |  what would you have me do out riding |  well and how was it that you engaged a stranger for your defence | asked the baroness thus placing the conversation in the hands of the vicar general |  the president of the court played this pleader a trick by appointing him to defend at the assizes a half witted peasant accused of forgery | but monsieur savaron procured the poor man's acquittal by proving his innocence and showing that he had been a tool in the hands of the real culprits | not only did his line of defence succeed but it led to the arrest of two of the witnesses who were proved guilty and condemned | his speech struck the court and the jury | one of these a merchant placed a difficult case next day in the hands of monsieur savaron and he won it | in the position in which we found ourselves monsieur berryer finding it impossible to come to besancon monsieur de garcenault advised him to employ this monsieur albert savaron foretelling our success | as soon as i saw him and heard him i felt faith in him and i was not wrong |  is he then so extraordinary | asked madame de chavoncourt |  certainly madame replied the vicar general |  well tell us about it said madame de watteville |  the first time i saw him said the abbe de grancey he received me in his outer room next the ante room old galard's drawing room which he has had painted like old oak and which i found entirely lined with law books arranged on shelves also painted as old oak | when he entered the spare room of the farmhouse madge with a smile that was like a ray of sunshine extended her hand from the lounge on which she was reclining and said: you didn't fail me graydon | i couldn't have kept up a moment longer | i should have fainted before had i not heard your voice | how good god has been | he held her hand in both his own his mouth twitched nervously but his emotion was too strong for speech |  don't feel so badly graydon she resumed and her voice was gentleness itself i am not hurt nor are you to blame |  i am to blame he said hoarsely |  i gave you that brute but he's dead | i shot him instantly | oh madge if if i feel that i would have shot myself |  graydon please be more calm she faltered tears coming into her eyes |  there see you are making me cry | i can't bear to see you i can't bear to see a man so moved | please now you look so pale that i am frightened | i'm not strong but shall get better at once if i see you yourself |  forgive me madge but it seems as if i had suffered the pangs of death ten times over there i won't speak about it till we both have recovered from the shock | dear brave little girl how can i thank you enough for keeping up till i could reach you | she began to laugh a little too nervously to be natural | her heart was glad over her escape and in a gladder tumult at his words and manner | he was no shadow of a man nor did ice water flow in his veins | his feeling had been so strong that it had almost broken her self control |  some day she exulted some day god will turn his fraternal affection into the wine of love |  i'm so nervous she said that i must either laugh or cry | what a plight we are in | how shall we go forward or backward |  we shall not do either very soon | mrs hobson is making you a cup of tea and then you must rest thoroughly and sleep if possible |  what will you do |  oh i'll soothe my nerves with a cigar and berate myself on the porch | when you are thoroughly rested i'll have mr hobson drive us on to the nearest station | we are in no plight whatever if you received no harm |  i haven't | promise me one thing |  anything everything |  do no berating | i'm sorry you killed the horse but he did act vilely and i suppose you had to let off your anger in some way | i was angry myself at first he was so stupid | but when i found i couldn't hold him at all i thought i must die oh how it all comes back to me | what thoughts i had and how sweet life became | oh oh and she began sobbing like a child |  madge please i can't endure this indeed i can't | but her overwrought nerves were not easily controlled and he knelt beside her speaking soothingly and pleadingly |  dear madge dear sister madge | oh i wish mary was here | and he kissed her again and again |  graydon she gasped stop | there i'm better and she did seem to recover almost instantly |  law bless you sir said mrs hobson who had entered with the tea your sister'll be all right in an hour or so | graydon sprang to his feet and there was a strong dash of color in his face | as for the hitherto pallid madge her visage was like a peony and she was preternaturally quiet |  try to sleep madge said graydon from the doorway and i won't 'worry or take on' a bit and he disappeared | there was no sleep for her and yet she felt herself wonderfully restored | was it the potency of mrs hobson's tea | or that which he had placed upon her lips | chapter xxxvii you are very blind as a general rule graydon was not conscious of nerves and had received the fact of their existence largely on faith | but to day they asserted themselves in a manner which excited his surprise and some rather curious speculation | he found his heart beating in a way difficult to account for on a physiological basis his pulses fluttering and his thoughts in a luminous haze wherein nothing was very distinct except madge's flushing face startled eyes looking a protest through their tears | it was not so much an indignant protest as it was a frightened one he half imagined | and why was he so confused and disturbed that instead of sitting quietly down in the porch as he had intended he was impelled to walk restlessly to a neighboring grove | for one so intensely fraternal he felt he was continuing to take on in a very unnecessary style |  confound that woman | he muttered |  why did she have to come in just then and why should i blush like a schoolgirl because she caught me kissing one that i regard as a sister | and why did the word sister sound so unnatural when spoken by mrs hobson | 'great scott '| as henry says i hope i'm not growing to love madge | she would overwhelm me with ridicule infused perhaps with a spice of contempt if i gave her the impression that i had fallen out of love one week and in the next | hang it | i'm all broken up from this day's experience | i had better get on my feet mentally and then i shall be able to find out where i stand | the demon of restlessness soon drove him back to the house again and he learned that there would be a train in about two hours | they would still have time to dine at the kaaterskill and return before night | he therefore made arrangements to be driven to the station also to have the horse he had ridden and the saddles taken back to the under cliff house | there was a faint after glow on madge's cheeks when she joined him at the substantial repast which mr and mrs hobson insisted upon their partaking before departure but in all other respects she appeared and acted as usual | with a fineness of tact she was at home among her plain entertainers and put them at ease | mrs hobson continued to speak of her as graydon's sister and he had darted a humorous glance at the girl but it met such grave impassiveness of expression that he feared she was angry | when parting from her hostess madge spoke words which left a genial expression on the good dame's face for hours thereafter and at the station graydon put in mr hobson's hand more than he could have gathered from his stony farm that day although he had been called from the harvest field | during the first mile or two in the cars madge was very quiet and seemed almost wholly engrossed with the scenery | at last graydon leaned toward her and asked are you vexed with me madge |  i find that i must maintain my self control when with you graydon was the grave reply |  forgive me madge | i scarcely knew what i was doing | let your thoughts take my part a little | remember that within the hour i had believed i had lost you | i haven't had a chance to tell you yet but when you passed under the train you appeared from where i was to dash into it and i nearly fainted and fell off my horse | think what a horrible shock i had | i also was nervous and all broken up the first time in my life that i remember being so | i couldn't cry as you did and when off my balance kissing you was just as natural to me as madge's mouth had been twitching and now in spite of herself her laugh broke forth |  please forgive me madge and he held out his hand |  on condition that you will never do so again or speak of it again | never  he repeated ruefully | never  she said with severe emphasis |  i won't make any such promise he replied stubbornly |  oh very well | and she turned to the window |  confound it | he thought i'm not going to tie myself up by any such pledge | i'm not sure of myself or sure of anything except that i'm a free man and that madge won't be my sister | i shall remain free | she herself once said in effect that i could take a straight course when once i got my bearings and i shall permit no more promises or trammels till i do get them | they passed speedily on to the end of their journey and were the perfection of quiet well bred travellers he disguising a slightly vexatious constraint and sense of unduly severe punishment and she secretly exulting over the fact that he would not make the promise | when leaving the kaaterskill station her eyes first rested on the adjacent lake and its wide extent suggested the opportunity to pull an oar to some purpose | as the stage surmounted the last approach to the hotel and the valley of the hudson with the river winding through it like a silver band broke upon her vision the apparent cloud passed from her brow and her pleasure was unaffected | a few inquiries and the study of a map of the vicinity made it evident that the region abounded in superb walks and drives while from the front piazza there was a panorama that would never lose its changing interest and beauty | a suite of rooms was selected with the understanding that they should be occupied on wednesday | madge soon found herself the object of no little curiosity and interest | the story of her mad ride had reached the house and she was recognized by some who had been on the train but graydon met inquiries in such a way that they were not pushed very far | to a reporter he said is this affair ours or the public's | we have not trespassed on any one's rights | he reassured madge by saying don't worry about it such things are only the talk of a day | they returned during the afternoon | graydon's manner was courtesy itself and but little more but he was becoming a vigilant student of his companion and she soon was dimly aware of the fact |  i will understand her he had resolved |  i intend to get my bearings and then shape my course for i cannot help feeling that the destiny of the little girl who used to sit on my lap with her head on my shoulder is in some way interwoven with mine | even when i believed myself in love with another woman she had more power over me than stella more power to kindle thought and awaken my deeper nature | i begin to think that all her talk about being a friend good fellow etc is greater nonsense than my fraternal proposals | no friend fellow or sister could make my heart beat as it did to day | no human being in mortal peril could have awakened such desperate reckless despair as i felt at one time and with a smile to himself i never knew what a kiss was before | i'm not the fool to ignore all these symptoms | i'll fathom the mystery of this sweet peerless girl if it takes all summer and all my life | but the fair enigma at his side grew more inscrutable | neither by tone nor glance did she indicate that he was more to her than she had said |  do you wish to recognize the scenes we passed over this morning | he asked gently as they approached them |  no not yet | i don't wish to think about it any more than i can help |  your wishes are mine |  occasionally perhaps |  you shall see |  i usually do was her laughing answer | but she began to appear very weary and when they reached the under cliff house she went to her room and did not reappear again that day | graydon made even dr sommers's ruddy cheek grow pale by his brief narrative adding perhaps her nerves have received a severer shock than she yet understands | i wish you would tell mrs muir the story making as light of it as you can and with her aid you can insure that miss alden obtains the rest and tonics she needs | you can also meet and quiet the rumors that may be flying about and you know that miss alden has a strong aversion to being talked to or of about personal affairs | in youth health and sleep madge found the best restoratives and the morning saw her little the worse for the experiences of the previous day | the hours passed quickly in preparations for departure and in a call on mr and mrs wendall who gave evidence that they were becoming more resigned |  i am at work again said the farmer and so is nancy | there's nothing else for us to do but plod toward home where tilly is | regret was more general and sincere than is usual when the transient associations of a resort are broken | dr sommers's visage could not lengthen literally and yet it approached as nearly to a funereal aspect as was possible | he brightened up however when madge slipped something into his hand for the chapel | they were soon comfortably established in their new quarters and in the late afternoon madge was so rested that she took a short walk with graydon to sunset rock and saw the shadows deepen in the vast beautiful kaaterskill clove | then they returned by the ledge path | at last they entered the wonderful palenvilie road a triumph of practical engineering and built by a plain mountaineer who from the base of the mountain to the summit made his surveys and sloped his grades by the aid of his eye only | they had been comparatively silent and graydon finally remarked: it gives me unalloyed pleasure madge to look upon such scenes with you | there is no need of my pointing out anything | i feel that you see more than i do and i understand better what i do see from the changing expression of your eyes | don't you think such unspoken appreciation of the same thing is the basis of true companionship |  oh graydon what an original thought | he bit his lip and remarked that the evening was growing cool | at supper and during the evening his vigilance was not rewarded in the slightest degree | madge appeared in good spirits and talked charmingly even brilliantly at times but she was exceedingly impersonal and it was now his policy to follow her slightest lead in everything | he would prove that her wish was his as far as he knew it |  some day he thought i shall find a clew to her mystery | the next morning graydon went to the city and would not return till friday evening of the following week for it was now his purpose to resume business | in the evening he and his brother discussed their affairs which were beginning to improve all along the line | then their talk converged more upon topics connected with this story and among them was mr wildmere's suspension |  his failure don't amount to very much henry remarked he has always done business in a sort of hand to mouth way |  i am surprised that arnault permitted him to go down graydon said it couldn't have taken very much to keep him up |  it is said that arnault will have nothing to do with him and that this fact has hastened his downfall |  well so she played it too sharp on him also | i was in hopes that she would marry and punish him | i don't wonder at his course though for if he has a spark of spirit he would not forgive her treatment after she learned that you had not failed | oh how blind i was |  yes graydon you are very blind said mr muir inadvertently |  'are '| why do you use the present tense |  did i | replied mr muir a little confusedly |  well you see madge and i understood miss wildmere from the first |  oh hang miss wildmere | do you think madge now stop right there graydon | i think madge is the best and most sensible girl i ever knew and that's all you will ever get out of me |  pardon me henry | i spoke from impulse and not a worthy one either | i tell you point blank however that madge alden hasn't her equal in the world | i would love her in a moment if i dared | would to heaven i could have spent some time with her immediately after my return | in that case there would have been no wildmere folly | i declare henry when i thought she must be killed the other day i felt that the end of my own life had come | i can't tell you what that girl is to me but with her knowledge of the past how can i approach her in decency |  well said mr muir shrugging his shoulders and rising to retire you are out of the worst part of your scrape and madge is alive and well | this is not a little to be thankful for | i shall confine my advice to business matters | still were i in your shoes i know what i should do | 'faint heart ' you know | good night | graydon did not move or scarcely answer but with every faculty of mind concentrated he thought henry's explanation of his use of the present tense does not explain and there is more meaning in what he left unsaid in our recent interview than in what he said | can it be possible | let me take this heavenly theory and as we were taught at college see how much there is to support it | was there any change in her manner toward me before we parted years since | why she was taken ill that night when she first met miss wildmere and i stayed away from her so long idiot | from that hour he went forward scanning everything that had occurred between them until he saw again her flushing face and startled eyes when he kissed her and his belief grew strong that it was his immense good fortune to fulfil the prediction that madge should be happy | the thought kept him sleepless most of that night and made the time which must intervene before he could see her again seem long indeed | he did his utmost to get the details of his department well in hand during business hours but after they were over his mind returned at once to madge and never did a scientist hunt for facts and hints in support of a pet theory so eagerly as did graydon scan the past for confirmation of his hope that long years of companionship had given him a place in madge's heart which no one else possessed and that his blindness or indifference to the truth was the sorrow of her life | this view explained why she would not regard herself as his sister and could not permit the intimacy natural to the relation | when he examined the attitude of his own heart toward her he was not surprised that his affection was passing swiftly into a love deeper and far more absorbing than stella wildmere had ever inspired |  the old law of cause and effect he said smiling to himself and i can imagine no effect in me adequate to the cause | even when she scarcely cast a shadow she was more companionable than stella but it never occurred to me to think of her in any other light than that of little sister madge | almost as soon as the thought occurred to me and i had a right to love her love became as natural as it was inevitable | even in the height of my infatuation for stella madge was winning me from her unconsciously to myself | such thoughts and convictions imparted a gentle and almost caressing tone to his words when madge welcomed and accompanied him to his late supper on his return to the mountains | this significant accent was more marked than ever when she promenaded with him for a brief time on the piazza | nor did a little brusqueness on her part banish the tone and manner which were slight indeed but unmistakable to her quick intuition |  could henry have given him a hint | she queried and her brow contracted and her eyes flashed indignantly at the thought | as a result of the suspicion she left him speedily and in the morning was glad to hope from his more natural bearing that she had been over sensitive | the sagacious graydon however was maturing a plan which he hoped would bring her the happiness which it would be his happiness to confer |  she is so proud and spirited he thought that only when surprised and off her guard will she reveal to me a glimpse of the truth | if i consulted my own pride i wouldn't speak for a long time to come not till she had ceased to associate me with stella wildmere but if she is loving me as i believe she would love a man she shall not doubt an hour longer than i can help that i and my life's devotion are hers | sweet madge you shall make your own terms again | chapter xxxviii certainly i refuse you having heard that one of the finest views among the mountains was to be had at indian head a vast overhanging precipice facing toward the entrance to the kaaterskill clove graydon easily induced madge to explore with him the tangled paths which led thither | how his eyes exulted over her as she tripped on before him down the steep winding rocky paths | as he followed he often wondered where her feet had found their secure support so rugged was the way | yet on she glanced before him swaying bending to avoid branches or pushing them aside her motions instinct with vitality and natural grace | once however he had a fright | she was taking a deep descent swiftly when her skirt caught on a stubborn projecting stump of a sapling and it appeared that she would fall headlong but by some surprising self recovering power which seemed exerted even in the act of falling she lay before him in the path almost as if reclining easily upon her elbow and was nearly on her feet again before he could reach her side |  are you hurt | he asked most solicitously brushing off the dust from her dress |  not in the least she replied laughing |  well he exclaimed i don't believe you or any one else could do that so handsomely again if you tried a thousand times | don't try please | i carried you the other day some little distance and found that you were no longer a little ghost |  you carried me graydon | i thought the people from the farmhouse came |  oh i didn't wait for them | i was half beside myself |  evidently she replied a little coolly | her tone made him falter in his purpose and when at last they reached indian head she was so resolutely impersonal in her talk and had so much to say about the history and the legends of the region of which she had read that he felt that she was in no mood for what he intended to say | as the time passed he grew nervously apprehensive over his project and at last they started on their return with his plan unfulfilled | they agreed to try a path to their left which was scarcely distinguishable and it soon appeared to end at a point that sloped almost perpendicularly to a wild gorge that ran up between the hills |  that must be what is down on the map as tamper clove said madge and do you know some think that it was up that valley irving made poor rip carry the heavy keg | oh i wish we could get down into it and go back that way |  let me explore and he began swinging himself down by the aid of saplings and smaller growth |  some one has passed here recently he called back for trees are freshly blazed and branches broken | yes he cried a moment later here is a well defined path leading up the clove toward the hotel | do you think you dare attempt it |  certainly she answered and before he could reach her she was half way down the descent | madge  he cried in alarm |  oh don't worry she said i was over worse places in the west |  well what can't she do | he exclaimed as she stood beside him in the path |  i can't give up my own way very easily she replied |  you have found that out |  that don't trouble me in the least | i don't wish you to give up your own way | it's warm down here and our walk won't be so breezy as if we had followed the ridge |  we will take it leisurely and have a rest by and by | the gorge grew narrower and wilder | they passed an immense tree under which indians may have bivouacked and in some storm long past the lightning had plowed its way from the topmost branch to its gnarled roots | at last the path crossed a little rill that tinkled with a faint murmur among the stones making a limpid pool here and there | immense bowlders draped with varied hued mosses and lichens were scattered about where in ages past the melting glacier had left them | the trees that densely shaded the place seemed primeval in their age loftiness and shaggy girth |  oh what a deliciously cool and lovely spot | cried madge throwing down her alpenstock |  get me some oak leaves graydon and i will make you a cup and give you a drink | in a moment she made a fairy chalice with the aid of little twigs and when she handed it to him dripping with water his hand trembled as he took it |  why graydon she exclaimed what on earth makes you so nervous |  i am not used to climbing and i suppose my hand has a little tremor from fatigue |  you poor thing | here is a mossy rock on which you can imitate rip | you have only to imagine that my leaf goblet is the goblin flagon of irving's legend |  where and what would you be after twenty years |  probably a wrinkled spinster at santa barbara |  you wouldn't go away and leave me |  certainly i would if i couldn't wake you up | he looked into her mirthful eyes and lovely face | oh how lovely it was flushed from heat and climbing |  madge he said impetuously you have waked me every faculty of my soul every longing of my heart | will you be my wife | her face grew scarlet | she sprang to her feet and asked with half serious half comic dismay will i be your what |  i asked you to be my wife he began confusedly |  oh graydon this is worse than asking me to be your sister | she replied laughing |  your alternations fairly make me dizzy |  truly madge he stammered a man can scarcely pay a woman a greater compliment oh it's a compliment | she interrupted |  no he burst out with more than his first impetuosity i'm in earnest | you who almost read my thoughts know that i am in earnest that by a strong yet simple gesture she checked him |  you scarcely realize what you are asking graydon she said gravely |  i have no doubt your present emotion is unforced and sincere but it requires time to prove earnestness | you were equally sure you were in earnest a short time since and i had little place comparatively in your thoughts |  but i did not know you then as i do now |  you thought you did | you had vivid impressions then about me and more vivid about another woman | you are acting now under another impression and from impulse | if i ever give myself away it shall not be in response to an impulse |  madge you misjudge me he began hotly |  i think i know most of the facts and you know how matter of fact i am | you may think i do not know what love is but i do | it is a priceless thing | it is a woman's life and all that makes a true woman's life | it is something that one cannot always give at will or wisely but if i had the power to give it at all it should be to a man who had earned the right to ask it and not to one who within a few short days had formed new impressions about me | love is not the affection of a friend or even of a sister | there is no necessity for me to marry |  then you refuse me | he said a little stiffly |  certainly i refuse you graydon | has my manner led you to think that i was eager for a chance to accept you |  oh no indeed | you have checked my slightest tendencies toward sentiment |  thank you for the assurance | i do not care in the least for sentiment | his airy fabric of hope of almost certainty had been shattered so suddenly that he was overwhelmed | there seemed but one conclusion |  madge he said in a low hoarse voice answer me yes or no | you loved some one at santa barbara who did not return your love | that is your trouble of which mrs wendall spoke i could not help hearing her words that is the mystery about you which has been haunting me with increasing perplexity that was the sorrow i heard in your voice the evening you sang in the chapel and which has vaguely yet strongly moved me since | tell me is it not so | tell me as a friend that i may be a truer friend | she had turned away in a manner that confirmed his thought |  you are suggesting a humiliating confession graydon |  yes humiliating to the man who saw you knew you yet did not love you | tell me madge | it will make my own course clearer |  yes then she replied | he sighed deeply and was silent for a few moments |  madge he at last resumed look at me | i wish to tell you something | she turned slowly toward him and he saw that her lip was trembling and that tears were gathering in her eyes |  you may think me cruel in wringing such a confession from you but perhaps you will forgive me when you hear all i have to say | you may look upon me now as a creature of impulses and impressions | the memory of my recent infatuation is fresh in your mind but you yourself said i could be straightforward when once i got my bearings | i have them now and i take my course | as a friend you have revealed to me much of your woman's nature and having known the best i shall not look for anything less than yours | i shall be devoted to you through life | i will be to you all that i can be all that you will permit | it is said that time heals all wounds | perhaps some day well if it ever can be i should be content to take what you could give | you said i was kind and patient with the little ghost | i should be far kinder gentler she had felt herself going fast and had almost yielded to the impulse to exclaim you graydon are the one who did not return my love and although your love has been so brief and untested compared with mine i will trust you when voices were heard on the same path by which they had come and the figures of other ramblers were seen indistinctly through the foliage | she gave his hand a strong pressure seized her alpenstock and hastened swiftly forward | the path soon afterward emerged on the public road | the breeze cooled her hot cheeks kissed away her tears and half an hour later they approached the hotel chatting as quietly as the strictest conventionality would require | chapter xxxix my true friend they found that mr muir had arrived and no family party in the long supper room appeared more free from disturbing thoughts and memories than the one gathered at the banker's table | in madge the keen eyed man could detect nothing that was unusual and in graydon only a trace of the dignity and seriousness which would inevitably follow some deep experience or earnest purpose | they all spent the evening and the greater part of the following day together and madge was touched more than once by observing that graydon sought unobtrusively to comply with even her imagined wishes and to enhance the point and interest of her spoken thoughts | in answer to his direct question she had acknowledged the absolute truth and yet it had proved more misleading than all the disguises which her maidenly reserve had compelled her to adopt | it seemed now that she would have no further trouble with him that he had defined his purpose and would abide by it | she was glad that she had not yielded to his appeal and rewarded him in the first consciousness of his new regard for her | this feeling had seemed too recent tumultuous and full of impulse and did not accord with her earnest chastened spirit that had attained the goal of its hope by such patient endeavor | she preferred that the first strong outflow from his heart should find wide deep channels and that his love for her should take the same recognized place in his life that her love had occupied so long in her own | she also had a genuine and feminine reluctance that the suitor of stella wildmere should be known as her lover so speedily and something more and deeper than good taste was the cause of her aversion | yet she was exceedingly happy | the hope that had sustained her so long that had been so nearly lost now seemed certain of fulfilment and no one but she and god knew how much this truth meant | only he had been her confidant and she felt that she had been sustained in her struggle from weakness to strength by a power that was not human and guided during the past weeks by a wisdom beyond her own |  he has proved to me a good father was her simple belief |  he led me to do the best i could for myself and then did the rest | i also am sure he would have sustained me had i failed utterly | that my life would not have been vain and useless was shown when i saved little nellie wilder | thus it may be seen that she was quite unlike many good people | in her consciousness god was not a being to be worshipped decorously and then counted out from that which made her real life and hope | the future now stretched away full of rest and glad assurance | graydon's manner already began to fulfil his promise | he would quietly accept the situation as he understood it and she saw already the steadying power of an unselfish unfaltering purpose | he appeared by years an older and a graver man and when he sat by her during the service in the wide parlor there was not a trace of his old flippant irreverence | whatever he now believed he had attained the higher breeding which respects what is sacred to others | she had but little compunction over his self sacrificing mood | it was perfectly clear that by quiet manly devotion he proposed to help time heal the wound made by that idiot at santa barbara and she that she could gradually reveal to him so much improvement that equanimity and at last hope would find a place in his mind | they parted monday morning with a brief strong pressure of hands which graydon felt conveyed volumes of sympathy and mutual understanding | she had said that he could write to her and he found he had so much to say that he had to put a strong constraint upon himself | mr muir had watched them curiously during his stay in the mountains and felt that something had occurred which he could not fathom | graydon's manner at parting and since during business hours had confirmed this impression | he was almost as grave and reticent as the banker himself and the latter began to chafe and grow irritable over the problem which he was bent on seeing solved in but one way | he looked askance and discontentedly at graydon during dinner in the evening | when they were alone he was fidgety and rather curt in his remarks | at last he burst out confound it | what has happened between you and madge |  she has refused me that's all was the quiet reply | mr muir gave a low whistle |  oh i understood you the other evening resumed graydon |  the phenomenal penetration on which you so pride yourself is at fault for once | the banker was so nonplused that he permitted his cigar to go out but he soon reached the conclusion he has bungled |  well he asked at last what do you propose to do |  to be to her all that she will ever permit and die a bachelor for her sake if i must | mr muir lighted his havana again and puffed in silence for a while then said i like that | your purpose is clearly defined | in business and everything else there is solid comfort in knowing what you can depend upon | madge's replies to graydon's letters were scarcely more than notes but they were breezy little affairs fragrant with the breath of the mountains and had an excellent tonic effect in the hot city | they usually contained a description of what she had seen or of some locality visited | on one occasion she wrote: late in the afternoon there had been a shower not gentle and pattering but one of those frightful passionate outbursts which are not infrequent in these mountains | the wind appeared to drive black masses of clouds from all directions save one which meeting over the height occupied by the hotel discharged torrents of rain | at last the wind left the writhing trees in peace and carried the deeply shadowing cloud away beyond the hills | the sun broke forth and nature began some magic work | calling the mist fairies to her aid she gathered from every ravine and clove delicate airy clouds which formed a large and rapidly increasing mass of vapor | soon the plain below the wide hudson valley was entirely shut out as though a great white curtain had dropped from the sky to the mountain's base | just then the setting sun which had been temporarily obscured shone forth in glorious brightness casting on the beautiful cloud curtain the dark clearly defined shadow of the mountain top with its crown of buildings even the towers and turrets showing with startling distinctness | it was like a mammoth well cut cameo or a gigantic magic lantern effect with the sun as a calcium light |  the spectacle lasted only a few moments | then the cloudy curtain parted and the valley of the hudson was seen again spanned by a rainbow | the days lengthened into weeks graydon coming every friday afternoon and wondering slightly at the demurely radiant face that greeted him |  truly he thought in the words of the old hymn she 'puts a cheerful courage on ' | at times however she would be a little pensive | then his tones would have a greater depth and gentleness and his sympathy was very sweet although she felt a little guilty because she was in no need of it | she could stifle her compunction by thinking: there was such a long weary time when i did need it and was desolate because of its absence that i must have a little now to offset those gray lonely days | she had thought she loved him before but as she saw him patiently and unselfishly seeking to brighten her life in every possible way with no better hope than that at some time in the indefinite future she might give him what was left of her heart after the old fire had died out her former affection seemed as pale and shadowy as she was herself when first she learned that she had a woman's heart | late one friday afternoon he startled her by asking abruptly madge what has become of that fellow out west |  please don't speak about that again she faltered |  oh well certainly not if you don't wish me to but i thought if there was any chance chance for what graydon |  confound him | i don't suppose i could do anything | i want to make you happy madge | i feel just like taking the idiot by the ear bringing him to you and saying 'there you unconscionable fool look at that girl ' you know what i mean | i'm suggesting the spirit not the letter of my action | but madge believe me if i could help you at any cost to myself is your regard for me of which you spoke so slight that you could go to work deliberately to bring that man to me |  there is no regard about it | my love for you is so great that i would do anything to make you happy |  madge called the voice of mrs muir who was following them with her husband where are you and graydon | here  cried madge springing up | then she gave her hand to him and he saw that there were tears in her eyes |  graydon she said i couldn't ask a stronger test than that | i can't tell you how i appreciate it | i shall never impose any such task upon you |  don't hesitate on my account | i admit that it would be harder than one of the labors of hercules but you command me now and always | nothing is so bad as to know that you are unhappy |  do i seem very unhappy |  no you brave little woman | but who could guess the truth if you were | my knowledge is not derived from your usual manner |  it is a pity if i cannot be patient when you set me so good an example she said as mr and mrs muir approached | when they were alone again for a brief time during the ramble graydon resumed: i wish to make sure of your confidence madge i wish you to take me at my word | i don't think you have been quite just to me | i am not a cold blooded fellow and no doubt am given to impressions and impulses but i think constancy is one of my traits | i never wavered in my affection for you until i misunderstood you immediately after my return and then that very misapprehension kept me worried and perplexed much of the time | i was true to miss wildmere as long as there was anything to be constant to and yet for years she was scarcely anything more than a fancy a preference | since my return you know just what she was to me | nothing is more certain than that i never loved her | i did not know what the word meant then | there is a chapter in your history that i don't know much about but i am sure i could make good my word to do anything within my power to bring you happiness | i have imagined that a little management guided by tact and absolute fidelity don't say anything more about that graydon she said firmly |  not if my heart broke a thousand times would i seek a man or permit him to be sought for me in any such way as you suggest |  that's settled then |  that's settled forever |  well in that case he said with a short nervous laugh there may be a chance for me within the next hundred years |  are you so willing to take a woman who had once given her heart to another |  i don't know anything about 'a woman '| i would take you madge under any circumstances that i can imagine |  graydon said mrs muir suddenly appearing around a turn in the walk what is the matter with you | why can't you and madge keep with us more | for some reason we are getting separated all the time | this is a lovely spot | let us sit down here like a family party and have a little music | i just long to get back home so that madge may sing for us as much as we wish | here she would attract the attention of strangers and that ends the matter and so i feel as if i had a rare singing bird but never a song | in this secluded place no others will hear you madge |  very well | what do you wish | i feel like singing |  make your own choice |  i'll give you an old song then about friendship and with notes rivalling those of a hermit thrush that had been chanting vespers in the dense woods near by she sang a quaint melody her voice wakening faint echoes from the adjacent rocks | when she came to the last lines she gave graydon a shy glance which seemed to signify these words are for you |  kinder than love is my true friend | he'd die for me if that would end my sorrow | yes would live for me suffer and live unselfishly and that for him would harder be than at my feet to die for me | as she ceased she again encountered his steadfast gaze with a glance which said have i not done you justice | he was satisfied and felt that the presence of his relatives had secured a sweeter answer than might otherwise have been given an answer that contained all he could hope for then | humph  ejaculated mr muir very discontentedly |  what an appreciative remark henry | said madge laughing |  it was and it expressed my views said the banker dryly |  come mary let us go home to supper |  now i think the song very pretty said mary only there are no such people nowadays | as madge followed with graydon she continued laughing softly to herself |  you are not hiding vexation at henry | graydon asked |  oh no i understand henry | you think i am always hiding something | you at least should have understood my song |  yes madge he said gravely and you also made it clear that you understood me | i am content | she laughed imitating the ejaculation |  henry's 'humph '| was too rich for anything | it meant volumes | what sentimental fools he thinks us to be |  henry could no more understand such a song than sing it was graydon's somewhat irritable response |  no matter | such men are invaluable in the world | my nature is very much in accord with henry's and so far as he has had experience he is very sound |  with your saving clause in mind i agree with you perfectly about henry but not about yourself | your nature madge like your voice has a wide compass | with this one exception there was no other spoken reference during the remainder of the summer to the attitude toward her which he now maintained in thought and action | the season was drawing to a close and she had enjoyed the latter part of it beyond her fondest hopes and expectations | she made a few congenial acquaintances at the hotel and with them never wearied in exploring the paths that converged at the great caravansary and in visiting the various outlooks from which the same wide landscapes presented ever changing aspects | chief among these friends was a middle aged artist who was deeply imbued with the genius of the mountains and who had no little skill in catching and idealizing the lovely effects he saw | he proved her best guide for he had long haunted the region and the majority of the paths were due to his taste and explorations | in such congenial tasks he acted as agent for the sagacious and liberal owner of the vast property who was so wise that in his dealings with nature he employed one that loved and understood her | to madge the artist showed his favorite nooks and haunts where the wild beauty of the hills dwelt like a living presence and the scenery not yet painted which from certain standpoints almost composed itself on the canvas | thus he taught her to see the region somewhat as he did and to find in the general beauty definite natural pictures that were like flowers in the wilderness | she greatly enjoyed watching with him the wonderful moonlight effects on the vast shaggy sides and summit of high peak that reared its almost untrodden solitudes opposite the hotel | this mountain was the favorite haunt of fantastic clouds | sometimes in the form of detached mists they would pass up rapidly like white spectres from the vast chasm of the kaaterskill | again a heavy mass would settle on the whole length of the mountain the outlines of which would be lost and the whole take the semblance of one vast height crowned with the moon's radiance | nothing fascinated madge more than to observe how the artist caught the essential elements of beauty in the changing cloud scenery and reproduced the effects on a few inches of canvas and in her better appreciation of similar scenery thereafter she saw how true it is that art may be the interpreter of nature | the fine music and varied entertainments at the house served also to beguile her time | on one occasion the young people were arranging a series of tableaux and she was asked to personate jephtha's daughter | when the curtain rose on her lovely face and large dark eyes the hebrew maiden and her pathetic history grew into vivid reality against the dim background of the past | after all the time that intervened between monday and friday afternoon was spent in waiting and even the hours toward the last were counted | the expression in graydon's dark blue eyes was always the same when he greeted her and recalled the line: kinder than love is my true friend | on saturdays they took long tramps seeking objective points far beyond the range of ordinary ramblers | chapter xl the end of the wooing madge had often turned wistful eyes toward high peak and on the last saturday before their final return to the city she said to graydon dare we attempt it | perhaps if we gave the day to the climb and took it leisurely there's no 'perhaps' about it | we'll go if you wish | i should like nothing better than to get lost with you |  there is no danger of getting lost she replied hastily |  the hotel must be visible from the whole line of its summit and i am told that there is a path to the top of the mountain |  i will be ready in half an hour he said | it was a lovely day in early september | the air was soft yet cool and bracing enough to make climbing agreeable | graydon had a lunch basket which he could sling over his shoulder well filled and ordered a carriage |  there is no need of our tramping over the intervening miles of dusty roads which must be passed before we begin our climb he said and the distance we ride will make a pleasant drive for mary and the children | madge and graydon reached the summit without any great difficulty mary having returned with the assurance that they would find their own way back to the hotel | as the hours passed graydon began to gather more hope than he had dared to entertain since his shattered theory had so disheartened him | in spite of his fancied knowledge about madge it was hard to believe she was very unhappy that morning | there was an elasticity to her step a ring of genuine gladness in her tones and laugh which did not suggest that she was consciously carrying a heavy burden |  she certainly is the bravest and most unselfish girl i ever imagined he thought as they left the highest point after enjoying the view |  with an art so inimitable as to be artless she has tried to give me enjoyment | instead of regarding herself as one to be entertained she has been pouring forth words fancies snatches of song like sparkling wine and i am exhilarated instead of being wearied | when at last they found a spring at which to eat their lunch he told her so concluding this mountain air does you good madge |  so do you she replied with a piquant nod |  don't be conceited when i tell you that you are good company |  no but i can't help being happy |  oh indeed | it doesn't seem to take much to make you happy |  not very much from you |  pass me a biscuit graydon i want something more substantial than fine speeches after our climb | isn't all this truly arcadian this mossy rug on which we have placed our lunch the trees whispering about us overhead and the spring there bubbling over with something concerning which it murmurs so contentedly |  i wonder what they think of us | i can imagine one thing |  you are always imagining | the idea of your being a banker | well there is a loud whisper from the trees | what was remarked |  that yonder little girl doesn't look so very unhappy |  no graydon she said earnestly you make saturdays and sundays very bright to me | no girl ever had a truer friend than you are becoming |  have become madge |  graydon she said eagerly as if hastening from dangerous ground the hotel is there just opposite to us | don't you think we could scramble down the mountain here and return by kaaterskill clove and the falls | it would be such fun and save such a very long distance |  we'll try it he said |  come she resumed brusquely you are spoiling me | you say yes to everything | if you don't think it safe or best you must not humor me |  we can soon learn whether it's safe and practicable and there is no danger of losing our way | we have only to return over the mountain in order to strike the path somewhere at right angles |  let us hasten then | i am in the mood to end our sojourn in the catskills by an hour or two of contact with nature absolutely primitive | the scenes we shall pass through will be so pleasant to think of by a winter fire |  winter fire | that's capital | you are not going back to santa barbara madge |  i haven't promised that i haven't promised anything |  no i have done all the promising |  you did so of your own free will |  and of my own free will shall keep my promises | no don't let us leave any remnants of our lunch | should we get lost you will want something more substantial than fine speeches |  i shall indeed | graydon filled from the spring the bottle which had contained milk and then packing his little hamper he led the way downward over and through obstacles which often involved no little difficulty and sometimes almost danger | he transformed parsons into laymen because he transformed laymen into parsons | he liberated men from outward religiosity because he made religiosity an inward affair of the heart | he emancipated the body from chains because he laid chains upon the heart | but if protestantism is not the true solution it was the true formulation of the problem | the question was no longer a struggle between the layman and the parson external to him it was a struggle with his own inner parson his parsonic nature | and if the protestant transformation of german laymen into parsons emancipated the lay popes the princes together with their clergy the privileged and the philistines the philosophic transformation of the parsonic germans into men will emancipate the people | but little as emancipation stops short of the princes just as little will the secularization of property stop short of church robbery which was chiefly set on foot by the hypocritical prussians | then the peasants' war the most radical fact of german history came to grief on the reef of theology | to day when theology itself has come to grief the most servile fact of german history our status quo will be shivered on the rock of philosophy | the day before the reformation official germany was the most abject vassal of rome | the day before its revolution it is the abject vassal of less than rome of prussia and austria of country squires and philistines | meanwhile there seems to be an important obstacle to a radical german revolution | revolutions in fact require a passive element a material foundation | theory becomes realized among a people only in so far as it represents the realization of that people's needs | will the immense cleavage between the demands of the german intellect and the responses of german actuality now involve a similar cleavage of middle class society from the state and from itself | will theoretical needs merge directly into practical needs | it is not enough that the ideas press towards realization reality itself must stimulate to thinking | but germany did not pass through the middle stages of political emancipation simultaneously with the modern nations | even the stages which she has overcome theoretically she has not reached practically | how would she be able to clear with a salto mortale not only her own obstacles but at the same time the obstacles of modern nations obstacles which she must actually feel to mean a liberation to be striven for from her real obstacles | a radical revolution can only be the revolution of radical needs whose preliminary conditions appear to be wholly lacking | although germany has only accompanied the development of nations with the abstract activity of thought without taking an active part in the real struggles incident to this development she has on the other hand shared in the suffering incident to this development without sharing in its enjoyments or their partial satisfaction | abstract activity on the one side corresponds to abstract suffering on the other side | consequently one fine day germany will find herself at the level of european decay before she has ever stood at the level of european emancipation | the phenomenon may be likened to a fetish worshipper who succumbs to the diseases of christianity | looking upon german governments we find that owing to contemporary conditions the situation of germany the standpoint of german culture and finally their own lucky instincts they are driven to combine the civilized shortcomings of the modern state world whose advantages we do not possess with the barbarous shortcomings of the ancien r gime which we enjoy in full measure so that germany is constantly obliged to participate if not intelligently at any rate unintelligently in the state formations which lie beyond her status quo | is there for example a country in the world which shares so na vely in all the illusions of the constitutional community without sharing in its realities as does so called constitutional germany | was it necessary to combine german governmental interference the tortures of the censorship with the tortures of the french september laws which presupposed freedom of the press | just as one found the gods of all nations in the roman pantheon so will one find the flaws of all state forms in the holy roman german empire | this mental anguish and the effort he put forth to respond to these words caused great beads of sweat to start out upon his face | suddenly as if a giant hand was lifted the effects of the shock resulting from his fall passed away | he opened his eyes and there was madge with her face buried upon his breast in brief oblivion from fears that threatened to crush at once hope and life | to his great joy he found that he could move | feebly and with great difficulty he lifted her head and tried to regain his feet | he found this impossible and soon realized that his leg was broken | he now saw that he must act wisely and carefully or their plight would be serious indeed and yet his mind was in such a tumult of immeasurable joy at his discovery that he would not in the least regret the accident if assured of her safety | at last in response to his efforts she began to revive | the sense of responsibility the necessity for action on her part had been so great immediately before she had fainted under the stress of one overwhelming fear that her mind even during unconsciousness may have put forth effort to regain its hold upon sense | she found herself leaning against a prostrate tree and graydon sitting near speaking to her in soothing and encouraging tones | in response to her bewildered troubled look of inquiry he said cheerfully and in natural tones don't worry madge or be frightened |  what has happened graydon |  i'll tell you what i know and you must supply the rest | we were proceeding along that ledge above us and trying to find a safe place to climb down | a slow deep color began to take the place of her pallor showing that her own memory was supplying all that had occurred |  you know i fell madge | thank god i did not carry you down with me |  any other man would she said almost brusquely |  you threw my hand back around a tree |  did i | exclaimed graydon very innocently and gladly |  well everything became very confused after that | i must have been unconscious | i do remember grasping at the branches as i passed through these low trees above us you must have caught one of them graydon she said eagerly turning toward him again for a large limb had broken off and was lying upon you |  was it so | perhaps i owe it a good turn for it may have so broken my fall as to have saved my life | well in some way you true brave little girl you must have reached me and finding that you could not restore me and imagining i was dead or dying you fainted yourself from the nervous shock of it all | when i recovered the use of my senses i found evidence that you had been trying to revive me | now madge we must both be brave and sensible | we must regain the full possession of our wits as soon as possible | can you be very brave and sensible to use your favorite word if i tell you something |  yes graydon she said |  i can do anything now that i know you are going to live |  i am very much alive and shall be thoroughly conscious of the fact for some time to come | you must keep perfectly cool and rational for what has happened is a very serious affair under the circumstances | her scarlet face was turned from him again |  madge he concluded in quiet tones i've broken my leg |  is that all | she said with a look of intense relief |  isn't that enough | i'm helpless |  i'm not and she sprang to her feet why graydon it might have been a hundred fold worse | i thought it was immeasurably worse she said suppressing a sob |  you might have been killed | see how far you fell | i feared you might have received some terrible internal injury i have but that's a chronic affair as you know he interrupted laughing | his mirth and allusion did more to restore her than all else for he appeared the same friend that she thought she had lost |  now that it is so evident that you will survive all your injuries she resumed with an answering laugh i am myself again | you direct me what to do |  i shall indeed have to depend on you almost wholly and the fact that another must look to you in such a strait will do more to keep you up than all cordials and stimulants | i can do very little myself forgive me graydon | you know i am not indifferent | are you in much pain | and her voice was very gentle |  not yet | you must act contrary to your instincts for once and exert all your ingenuity to attract attention | first we must have a fire meanwhile i shall light a cigar which will help me to think and banish the impression that we are lost babes in the woods | the smoke you see will draw eyes to this spot the smoke of the fire i mean |  i'm following you correctly |  you must have followed me very bravely heroic little woman that you are | you are indeed unlike other girls who would never have reached me except by tumbling after come no more reminiscences till you are safe at the hotel and your leg mended |  very well | i direct but you command | as soon as we have a column of smoke ascending from this point you must try to find an open space near here and wave something white as a signal of distress | he had scarcely concluded before she was at work | the prostrate tree against which he had managed to place her at such pain to his broken limb served as a back log and soon a column of smoke was ascending | at times she would turn a shy half doubting half questioning glance at him but he would smile so naturally and speak so frankly that the suspicion that he had heard her words almost passed from her mind |  madge he said in finding an outlook toward the hotel or valley don't go far away if possible | it makes me awfully nervous to think of you climbing alone | she found a projecting rock beneath them within calling distance and on an extemporized pole she fastened the napkins | at his suggestion she waved them only downward and upward at the same time sending out her powerful voice from time to time in a cry for help | he left alone sometimes groaned from an unusually severe twinge of pain and again laughed softly to himself over the situation | he knew that the question of their being sought and found was only one of time and he would have been willing to have had all his bones broken should this have been needful to secure the knowledge which now thrilled his very soul with gladness | the past grew perfectly clear and the pearl of a woman who had given herself to him so long ago gained a more priceless value with every moment's thought ah sweet madge | i'm the blessed idiot you loved and toiled for at santa barbara | i shouldn't have believed that such a thing could happen in this humdrum world | nor would it seem that the attention of even a fraction of that great world could be obtained | the shadows of evening began to gather and madge at graydon's call returned wearied and somewhat discouraged |  cheer up he said |  it is only a question of time | we shall soon be missed and our signals will be more effective when it is dark | see we shall not starve | i have been getting supper for you | keeping the remnants of our lunch wasn't a bad idea was it |  keeping up your courage and mine is a better one | graydon i fear you are suffering very much |  oh madge armies of men have broken their legs | that's nothing but a little disagreeable prose while this adventure with you is something to talk and laugh over all our lives | i've cut my boot off and bandaged my leg as well as i could and am now hungry | that's a good sign | i shall be positively hilarious if you make as good supper as this meagre spread permits | take a little water for your throat must be parched | you will have to drink it from the bottle pat's fashion for my rubber cup is broken |  indeed a little water is all i want at present and i must gather wood for the fire before it is darker |  very well he said laughing supper shall wait for you | the vicinity appeared as if never before visited and there was an abundance of dead and decaying wood lying about | when she had secured a large quantity of this she came and sat down by the fire and said i will take a little supper now and then it will be so dark that we can signal in some other way |  madge said graydon earnestly it has cut me to the heart to lie helplessly here and see you doing work so unsuitable |  nothing could be more suitable under the circumstances | you do think we shall be found soon | oh i'm so worried about you |  more then than i am about myself | i shall have to play invalid for some time | won't you be my nurse occasionally |  yes graydon all i can |  why then don't worry about me at all | the prospect makes me fairly happy | come now eat the whole of that sandwich | she complied looking thoughtfully into the fire meanwhile | by the light of the flickering blaze he saw the trouble and worry pass from her brow and the expression of her face grow as quiet and contented as that of a child's | at last she said well this does seem cosey and companionable in spite of everything | there forgive me graydon i forgot for the moment that you were in pain |  was i | i forgot it too | sitting there in the firelight you suggested the sweetest picture i ever hope to see |  you can't be in extremis when you begin to compliment |  don't you wish to know what the picture was |  oh yes if it will help you pass the time |  i saw you sitting by a hearth and i thought 'if that hearth were mine it would be the loveliest picture the world had known '| now you see what an egotist i am | you look so enchanting in that firelight that i cannot resist i would try so hard to be worthy of you madge | make your own terms again as i said once to you before |  my own terms | she repeated turning a sudden and searching glance upon him |  then tell me did you hear what i said this afternoon when i first found you | he hesitated a moment and then said firmly: yes every word but madge you must not punish me for what i could not help | it would not be right |  could you hear me and yet i could hear you and yet could not move a muscle until you fainted and then my intense mental excitement and solicitude must have broken the paralysis caused by the shock of my fall | oh madge look at me | only a false pride can come between us now | my love is not worthy to be compared with yours but it is genuine and it will it will last as long as i do | i shall bless this accident and all the pain i must suffer if they bring you to me | she sprang to his side and putting her arm around his neck said graydon on the evening after your return i told you i couldn't be your sister | you know why now and you uttered these words 'i shall have to take you as you are if i ever find out '| i meant to win you if i could but only by being such a girl as i thought you would love | now you know the mystery of the little ghost and you can bring to me that 'idiot' who didn't return my love as often as you choose |  thank heaven for what i escaped | thank god for what i have won | he exclaimed | won nonsense  you have been won not i oh graydon wouldn't you have been amazed and horrified if you had been told years ago that the little ghost would go deliberately to work to woo a man and take him from another girl | think how dreadful it sounds | but you shall now know the worst |  it's music that will fill my life with gladness | how exquisitely fine your nature is that you could do this with such absolute maidenly reserve | suppose i had become stella wildmere's bondman |  i should have gone back to santa barbara and kept my secret | horrible   i said you knew all but i am mistaken | now don't be shocked back into your kind of unconsciousness again | i did another horrid thing | i listened and learned about the plot by which arnault meant to bring miss wildmere to a decision against you and she told him the circumstances and what had passed between herself and henry | his arm tightened around her almost convulsively |  madge he cried you have not only brought me happiness you have saved me from a bitter lifelong self reproach far worse than poverty | how can i ever show sufficient devotion in return for all this |  by being sensible and telling me how to make signals now that it is as dark as it will be this moonlight night |  let me lean on you as i ever shall figuratively hereafter | we will go down to the outlook you found build another fire and wave burning brands | this was done | henry muir who had grown very solicitous saw their signals and promptly organized a rescuing party | a wood road led well up toward their position and with the aid of some employ s of the house he at last rescued them | graydon was weak and exhausted from pain by the time he reached the hotel yet felt that his happiness had been purchased at very slight cost | you are breaking your parole and risking shame for me | nay you have shamed me already | polly is here |  polly is a good girl she understands | a word then if you must drive me away |  your parole |  i can pass the sentries | no fear of the patrol hereabouts | your hand let down your hand to me | i can reach it from the parapet here with my fingers only not with my lips though even that you never forbade | weakly she lowered her arm over the sill | he reached to touch it and she leaned her face towards his hers in shadow his pale in the moonlight | before their fingers met a yellow flame leapt from the angle to the left a loud report banged in her ears and echoed across the park and raoul after swaying a second pitched forward with a sharp cry and rolled to the foot of the glacis | dorothea forced herself back in the room and stood there upright and shook with polly beside her holding her two hands |  they have shot him | the two women listened for a moment | all was still now | polly stepped to the window and closed it softly |  but why | what are you doing | dorothea asked in a hoarse whisper |  they will find quite enough without that said the practical girl but her voice quavered |  yet if they had seen ah how selfish to think of that now | hush that was a groan | he is alive still | she moved towards the window but polly dragged her back by main force |  listen miss | below they heard the sudden unbarring of doors and endymion's voice calling for mudge the butler | a bell pealed in the servants' hall stopped and began ringing again in short and violent jerks |  let me go commanded dorothea |  they will never find him under the slope there | he may be bleeding to death | i must tell but polly clung to her |  they'll find him safe enough miss dorothea | there's sam now hark at the backdoor bell: he'll tell them | sam   sam zeally miss |  but i don't understand dorothea stammered with a sharp suspicion of treachery she pushed the girl from her |  was
