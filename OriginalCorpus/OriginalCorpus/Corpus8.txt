chapter i the last strain of the grand old christmas hymn had just been warbled forth from the throats and hearts of a number of happy folks who were seated around the blazing log one christmas eve and on the face of each one of that family circle the cheering light revealed the look of happiness the young happy in the present and indulging in hopeful anticipations for the future the old equally happy as the young and revelling in many a darling memory of the past |  come uncle john | said a bright eyed flaxen haired beauty over whose head not more than ten christmas days had passed come uncle do tell us a story you know that we always expect one from you | as a rule i am not one to peer over shoulders and read other people's letters or papers | but when one is in a queue waiting for one's passport to be vis d and when one has been there for an hour and still seems no nearer to the promised land and when it is the second time in the day that one has been in a queue for the same purpose once in france and once in england why some little deflection from the narrow path of perfect propriety may be forgiven | moreover in other ways i behaved better than many of my fellow travellers for i stood loyally behind the man in front of me in my due place and did not as others did insinuate myself from the side into positions to which by all the laws of precedence and decency they were disentitled | indeed i even caught myself wondering whether had i any preferential opportunities of getting through first as some red cross and otherwise influential people had i should make use of them | to take any advantage of this weary waiting line of suspects of which i was one would have been almost monstrous | so standing there all patiently and dejected moving forward a foot or so every four or five minutes no wonder that i found myself reading the embarkation paper which the gentleman in front of me had filled up and was holding so legibly before him | he was tall and solid and calm and french with a better cut coat than most frenchmen even the aristocrats trouble about | he was broad shouldered and erect and i was piqued to find him for all his iron grey hair five years younger than myself | his name was never mind but i know it | his profession was given as publicist as though he were mr arnold white or sir henry norman although for all i know sir henry norman may by now be a brigadier general | his reasons for visiting england given in english were in connection with his profession | but after that his english broke down for when it came to the question what was his sex how do you think he had answered it | i consider that his solution of the difficulty was an ample reward to me and to you if you too have any taste in terminological exactitude for my fracture of a social convention | the word he had wanted was either male or masculine but they had evaded him | he had then cast about for english terminology associated with men and had thought vaguely of master and mister | the result was that the line ran thus: sex: masterly | and looking at the publicist's soign moustache and firm jaw and broad hands i could believe it | but what an inspiration | and dear me | what will the panks if there are any left say |  to teachers and business ladies | heathful holiday in north wales brainy air | provincial paper | think what it has done for mr lloyd george | identification  how often the kind of thing occurs that i am about to describe | four or five summers ago before the world went mad i was on one of david macbrayne's steamers on the way to a scotch island | among the few passengers was an interesting man with whom i fell into conversation | he was a vigorous bulky very tall man with a pointed grey beard and a mass of grey hair under a panama and he was bound he told me for a well known fishing lodge whither he went every august | he had been a great traveller and knew persia well he had also been in parliament and one of his sons was in the siege of mafeking | so much i remember of his affairs but his name i did not learn | we talked much about books and i put him on to doughty's arabia deserta | i have often thought of him since and wondered who he was and whenever i have met fishermen or others likely to be acquainted with this attractive and outstanding personality i have asked about him but never with success | a jug of herb tea is on the table | the fire is very low and the light from it is only sufficient to render all indistinctly visible | in a chair opposite is a young woman with such a mournful careworn face that a glance inspires you with sorrow and from a bundle of clothes on her knee issues the fretful wail of a restless child | the monotonous tick of an old clock is the only sound saving the longdrawn sigh of that young mother or the quick hollow breathing of the sleeping man | now and then the wind whistles more shrilly through the crevices of the door and the rain beats with greater force against the little window | the mother draws still nearer to the few red embers and turns a timid glance to the window and then to the bed: another sigh and then the overburdened heart overflows at her eyes and the large bright drops fall quickly on that dearly loved infant | the church clock chimes a quarter after six this rouses the mother once more to set aside her own griefs the wind still howls and the rain beats with unabated fury against the glass: her thoughts are of those little ones and a tremor passes over her as she fears lest they should be shut out | the man moves wearily in his bed and opening his eyes he looks towards his wife | she is at his side in an instant |  have they gooan bessy | he asks |  eea they've gooan an' aw hooap ther thear before nah |  it saands vary wild | we ne'er thowt it ud come to this twelve year sin bess an' it's all along o' me |  nay jim tha munnot say soa tha knows we can nooan on us help bein poorly sometimes but when spring comes tha'll pick up thi crumbs agean an' things 'll be different |  that's true lass aw feel that's true things will be different when spring comes an' afoor it comes aw'm feeard | has ta iver been i' bed to neet |  nay aw couldn't come to bed 'coss th' child wor cross but aw've slept a bit i' th' cheer: dooant thee bother aw'l look after mi sen | will ta have a sup o' this teah | whisht  he said that's awr susy callin aw'm sure it is | oppen th' door | she flew to oppen th' door and the storm rushed in with fury the snow had begun to fall thickly: she strained her eyes and called susy |susy  but she heard no response: yet her heart misgave her for the thoughts of her darlings being exposed to such a storm made her shudder but necessity knows no law and on the slender earnings of these two children depended the subsistence of herself and husband |  aw think tha wor mistakken jim: aw con see nowt she said as she returned and closed the door |  well happen aw wor but it's a sorry mornin to turn aght two little lambs like them | bessy he said lowering his voice to a whisper aw know aw'm i'th' gate aw con do nowt but lig i' bed an' aw know 'at thee an' th' childer have to goa short mony a time for what aw get but it willn't be for long | dooant rooar | tha knows it's summat 'at we've nowt to do wi an' tha heeard what th' parson said 'ther's one aboon at 'll work all things together for gooid ' an' aw feel my time's commin' varry near but aw'm nooan freetened like aw used to be aw think it's gooin to be a change for th' better an' he'll luk after thee an' th' little ens | o jim  tha munnot talk abaght leavin us yet tha'll be better in a bit |  niver i' this world bessy | come put thi heead o' th' pillow here beside me aw think aw want to rest | she placed the little babe upon the coverlet laid her head upon the pillow and worn out with watching she wept herself asleep | the church clock had chimed the half hour before tom and his little sister landed at the mill yard and it was closed | the storm was still raging but to his repeated entreaties for admission the same answer was returned tha'rt too lat | tha connot come in afoor th' braikfast | experience had taught him how vain his endeavours would be to obtain admission and had it been himself alone that was shut out he would have gone quietly away and spent the time as best he might but he felt emboldened by the responsibility that was upon him on his sister's account and he redoubled his efforts but the timekeeper was inexorable: my orders iz az nubdy mun come in after a quarter past an' if tha doesn't goa away aw'l warm thi jacket for thi tha should ha come i' time same as other fowk | poor tom | there had still lingered some little faith in the goodness of human nature in his breast but as he turned away the last spark died out | to attempt to go home he knew would be useless and therefore he sought as the only alternative some place where he might find shelter | at a short distance from the gate but within the sound of the whirling wheels he sat down with his uncomplaining sister upon his knee | the snow began to fall gently at first and he watched it as the feathery flakes grew larger and larger | he did not feel cold now he wrapped his little scarf around his sister's neck | the snow fell still thicker: he felt so weary so very weary his little sister too had fallen asleep on his breast he laid his head against the cold stone wall and the snow still fell so softly so very gently that he dozed away and dreamed of sunny lands where all was bright and warm: and in a short time the passer by could not have told that a brother and sister lay quietly slumbering there wrapped in their shroud of snow | the hum of wheels has ceased the crowd of labourers hurry out to their morning's meal a few short minutes and the discordant whistles again shriek out their call to work | tom and susy where are they | the gates will soon be closed again | well let them close | other gates have opened for those little suffering ones | the gates of pearl have swung upon their golden hinges no harsh voice of unkind taskmaster greets them on their entrance but that glorious welcome |  come ye blessed | and their unloosed tongues join in the loud hosannah | but those pearly gates are not for ever open | the time may come when those shall stand before them unto whom the words inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me shall sound the death knell of all hopes throughout an inconceivable eternity | chapter ii | it is night and the wind is sighing itself away | the snow has ceased to fall and the moon looks down upon the hills in their spotless covering shedding her soft mild light upon all | the little cottage on the hill side would be imperceptible were it not for the light that streams through the window and the open door | the church clock has just struck eight and for nearly an hour a woman has stood looking towards the town her anxiety increasing every moment | she listens to the sound of feet on the crisp snow they come nearer they are opposite the turn that leads to the cottage: but they pass on | again and again she listens: once or twice she fancies she sees two children in the distance but they come not | passersby become less frequent again the church clock chimes and all is still | her husband and her babe are asleep | quickly putting on her bonnet and shawl she runs to her nearest rleighbour to ask if she will sit with them until she returns for she must go and learn how it is that her children have not come home | she fears no denial and she meets with none as soon as she has stated her case the good woman replies sit wi' 'em lass | aw'm sure aw will | an' thee she said turning to her husband put on thi hat an' coit an' goa wi' her |  o they're nobbut laikin at snowball or else slurrin a bit he said at the same time he put on his hat and coat and showed as much alacrity to join in the search as the mother herself | owd becca thrust into her capacious pocket a tea cake and two eggs and taking the teapot into which she put a good supply of tea she prepared for starting off but suddenly recollecting herself she returned and called in loud tones to her daughter: sarah i get that sucking bottle an' fill it wi' milk for th' little en an' nah if yo two 'll nobbut bring th' childer back aw'l see 'at all gooas on reight at hooam | bessy began to express her thanks but becca was determined not to hear her and drowned all she said in exhorting her husband to luk sharp | bessy and old abe directed their steps to the factory but often paused to ask passers by if they had seen the two lost ones but as there had so many children passed whose outward appearance corresponded with theirs of whom they were in search they thought it best to go at once to the works and ascertain at what time they left | bessy's heart misgave her as she knocked at the gatekeeper's house an indefinable dread came over her and she scarce knew how to state her case | little did she think that within sound of her voice lay the dear objects of her search hundreds of feet had passed them during the day but none had disturbed them the whistles had screamed for them in vain for they had gone to that lasting rest prepared for the weary and heavy laden | from the gatekeeper they learned that the two had arrived too late in the morning and gone away somewhere but had not returned or been seen afterwards | bessy stood transfixed for a moment scarce knowing what to do but old abe could look at the case more calmly and taking hold of her hand he led her gently away and proceeded forthwith to the police station where he gave as full an account and as correct a description of the missing ones as he was able | it took but a short time to accomplish this much but the journey homewards was not so speedily performed | every dark corner was explored and every alley and by lane had to be traversed and the morning was far advanced when they reached home after their unsuccessful search | the husband and babe were still sleeping for becca had ministered to all their wants | she had buoyed herself with the hope that they would be successful: but when she saw them return alone her spirits sank as low as those of the mother and although she was silent yet the frequent application of the apron to her eyes showed that she felt as a mother for one so sorrowfully placed | promising to luk in i' th' morn' they left the disconsolate bessy to her grief | who shall attempt to describe the anguish of that bereaved parent | statuelike she sat nursing a sorrow too deep for tears | hours passed and the first faint streak of dawn found her still sitting with her eyes intently fixed on vacancy | her husband's voice was the first thing that roused her from the state of despondency into which she had sunk | he spoke with difficulty and his voice was feeble as a child's |  bessy he gasped tha munnot leave me ony moor | it's drawin varry near | awr little tom an' susy have been here wol tha's been off aw heeard 'em calling for me but aw could'nt goa until aw'd had a word wi' thee | aw'm feeard tha'll tak it hard lass but if tha finds tha cannot bide it ax th' parson to tell thee what he tell'd to me an' it'll comfort thee | bessy was unable to reply | sorrows had been heaped upon her so heavily that her feelings were benumbed she scarcely comprehended what was said but in the bitterness of her soul she fell upon her knees and sobbed lord help me | her husband feebly took her hand and drew her towards him |  he will help thee lassie niver fear | one kiss bessy gooid bye |tom  susy it's varry dark aw think aw want to sleep |  and ere that hour departed | all death reveals he knew | chapter iii | a change had taken place in the atmosphere since bessy and abe had returned | here and there green patches could be seen on the hill side and the distant town presented a view of smoke blackened roofs that shone dripping with wet as the sickly' sun glanced over them | little or no snow was to be found in the streets and all the hideous sights stood out once more rejoicing in their naked deformities | the giant engine the factory's heart was ceasing to beat once more in order to allow the workers time to swallow the food necessary to enable them to bear up until noon | the gates were opened and the crowd swarmed forth but all seemed instinctively directed to a group at a short distance whose pallid faces reflected the ghastly sight before them | the group soon swelled to a vast crowd | enquiries were made on every hand by those in the outer circle what is it | what is it |  frozen to death | tenderly those rough handed rough spoken men raised the death frozen little ones | some there were who knew them and had heard of their loss | it was to them an easy task to account for their deaths and curses low but deep were cast on them at whose doors the blood of those innocents must lie | the bodies were taken to the nearest inn to wait an inquest | those in authority were quickly on the alert whilst some who were acquainted with the parents prepared to carry them the sorrowful tidings poor bessy | thy cup of bitterness is nearly full | old becca had come according to promise and found bessy laid partially upon the bed in a swoon her arm around the neck of him who had been her faithful partner for a dozen years | she raised her bathed her forehead and used all means in her power to promote her recovery | after a short time she was successful and having prepared the other bed and placed bessy upon it she hastily left to get some assistance | the poor have but the poor on whom they can depend in an emergency and it is a blessing that the request for help to each other is rarely if ever made in vain | she soon returned with plenty of willing hands one took the babe and others remained to perform the last sad offices to the remains of him who had gone a little while before | soon the men arrived with the mournful account of the discovery of the children but bessy knew it not | god had had compassion upon her and to save her heart from breaking had thrown a cloud over her reason | silently they stood for a moment in that house of death and as they turned to go one after another placed what money each had noiselessly upon the table: the whole perhaps did not amount to much but who shall say that it was not a welcome loan to the lord an investment in heaven that should in after time yield to them an interest outweighing the wealth of the whole world | as the day advanced numbers gathered round the inn where the coroner and jury were assembled | the usual form of viewing the bodies was gone through and with the exception of the girl's ancle which was found to be dislocated there appeared nothing to account for death save exposure to the cold | the coroner quickly summed up and addressing the jury said he did not see how they could bring in any other verdict than 'died from natural causes ' | with one exception all acquiesced and this one refused to agree to such a verdict saying that death had been caused by unnatural causes | at last the verdict was altered to found frozen to death | to this a juryman wished to add something about arbitrary laws and inhumanity but he was overruled | it needed nothing now but to put them in the earth and cover them up | the following morning the whistles shrieked as fiercely the wheels went round as merrily as ever two other children were in the places of the lost ones and it was as if they had never been | the day for the funeral arrived the father and children were to be interred together | there was a large gathering of sympathising friends | poor bessy | had partially recovered but seemed like one just waking from a dream the mournful cortege gained the church yard | the coffins were slowly lowered into the grave | the grey haired pastor's voice was at times almost inaudible every heart was touched for all took the case home to themselves and asked the question how if they were mine |  dust to dust and ashes to ashes and the ceremony was completed | few of them had failed to remark the presence of a strange mourner one whose dress bespoke him to be a gentleman and as the widow turned to leave the grave he stept up to her and offered her his arm for support | she took it mechanically and wended her way to her desolate home | he was the only one with the exception of old becca who entered with bessy | he looked around the forlorn room gazing now here now there to hide his emotion | he seemed about to speak when a knock at the door interrupted him | becca opened it and returned with a letter stating that the bearer required an answer | the stranger took it with an air of authority and broke the seal as he did so a five pound note fluttered to the ground | while he read the letter his eyes flashed with a strange fire and his quivering nostril showed the strength of the passion raging within | turning to the boy he thrust the letter into his hand and bade him pick up the note |  take this answer to your master boy he said we return the letter and his money with disdain and tell him that bessy green is not so desolate and friendless that she needs accept five pounds as the price of two innocent lives | the debt is one that no man can cancel: but the reckoning day is sure to come | tell him that boy from the brother of bessy green from the uncle of tom and susy | the boy hurried away with the message and bessy who had been aroused by the stranger's vehemence at the word brother threw herself upon his neck crying it is george | what follows is quickly told: bessy's grief was deep and it took long long months before she was fitted to engage in the ordinary occupations of life but change of scene and cheerful company together with the daily expanding beauties of her only child partially healed her lacerated heart | her generous brother who had returned from a distant land where fortune had smiled upon his labours took her to live with him and adopted her child as his son | becca and abe became also installed in the house as helpers and now far away from the regions of factory whews they are all living amicably together |  that is my story for this christmas | how do you like it | it is very sorrowful uncle john but we are much obliged to you for telling it us but it is surely wrong for children so young to be compelled to go to work at such an early hour |  it may not be wrong to require them so to do but it would at least show a desire on the part of the employers to ameliorate the hardness of their lot if while endeavouring to enforce strict punctuality they would provide some shelter for those who having come from a distance fail to arrive in time for admission |  hark the village waits | pill jim's progress wi' johns bunion | it wor a varry wild day when john set off to see pill jim as he wor called but as it wor varry particklar business he didn't let th' weather stop him | nah pill jim wor a varry nooated chap i' some pairts o' yorkshire | he

him who he wor | he didn't like to tell me for a bit but at last he sed' he wor th' clerk o'th' weather office an' he'd just getten a day off bi th' way ov a leetnin' '| 'well ' aw says 'aw'll gie yo a box o' pills an' yo mun tak two ivery neet '| he thanked me an' went away an' aw've niver seen a wink on him sin but tha may be sure it's them pills 'at we have to thank for sich a oppen winter as we've had for as aw sed befoor they'll oppen owt |  well jim tha fair caps me | aw wonder tha hasn't made a fortun befoor nah | but aw dooant think aw want ony pills tho' aw'm badly enough |  why what

an' see yo in a bit to repoort progress | john limped hooam as weel as he could an' after puttin' th' pills into a pint basin i'th' cubbard he went to bed | his wife axed him what he could like to his supper but he sed he worn't particklar soa shoo went daanstairs an' when shoo luk'd i'th' cubbard shoo saw this basin o' pills but shoo thowt they wor pays soa shoo gate a bit o' mutton an' made a sup o' broth an' put 'em in an' when they'd been boilin' awhile shoo couldn't find 'em hardly |  why shoo sed aw niver saw sich pays as theease i' all mi life they've all boiled to smush | shoo tuk him a

front seeats supt twice when i look around me ladies and gentlemen and see so many old and familiar faces that i have never seen before and when i see so many strangers that i have passed long years of social intercourse amongst i feel ladies and gentlemen i feel moved very much moved and when i gaze again i begin to feel removed | our object which we have in view in keeping agate of giving these here readings are to throw open the doors of knowledge so that all may come and drink from the inexhaustible bottle so to speak ladies and gentleman which says 'drink and thirst no more' great cheering women wi' cleean pocket hankerchies blow ther nooases | these meetings have also another himportant object a nobject noble and great which is namely to draw people out of the public houses and create a thirst in them for wisdom | how many men after a hard day's work go and sit in the public house or what is still worse often spend their time at some thripny concert room until nine or ten o'clock whereas now they can come here and sit until 10 or 11 o'clock where they are not only hentertained but hedicated and hedified | with thease few remarks i call upon the first reader for a solo on the german concertina | an' it wor a solo | it reminded me o' being in a bazaar at fair time an' abaght a thaasand childer blowin penny trumpets an' he whewd his arms abaght like a windmill an' aw wor nooan sooary when he'd done | but fowk clapt an' stamped wol he coom back agean an' he bow'd an' sed he'd give 'em an immitation o'th' backpipe an' awve noa daat it wor varry like it for awm sure noa frontpipe iver made as faal a din | after that th' cheerman made a few remarks an' sed music had charms to soothe the savage beast an' he'd no doubt we all felt soothed with what we had heard | he had now the pleasure to call for something of a more elevating nature still | the next reading would be a comic song |  up in a balloon boys | th' chap 'at gave that wor varry wise for as sooin as he'd begun singin' he shut his een an' niver oppened 'em agean till he'd done an' if he'd kept his maath shut aw should ha' been better suited still | ov coorse he wor honcored an' he coom back an' sang be e eutifool oil of the se e e he | wol he fair fooamd at th' maath but awl wave mi opinion o' that | then coom th' gem o'th' evening an' th' chap wor a gem 'at sang it | th' cheerman sed he was always proud to be able to sit an' listen to such like for it show'd what a deal better world ther might be if we all did our best for one another | th' peanner struck up an' a chap in a big white hat an' longlapp'd coit sang what aw did for hannah an' afoor he'd finished aw thowt if he'd done hauf as mich for hannah as he'd done for us he owt to be shot | but when a chap's i' favor he con do owt an' when he'd done an' been called back three times th' cheerman sed it wor now his duty to introduce the rev'd dowell to read a selection from heenuck harden | as sooin as he'd sed this ivery body began to walk aght an' soa as aw thowt they must be gooin into another raam to hear it aw went aght too | but when awd getten aghtside aw saw they wor all awther leetin ther pipes or laikin at soddin one another | aw axed one on 'em if it wor all over |  net it he sed we've nobbut come aght wol yond dry old stick has done talking | th' best pairt o'th' entertainment has to come off yet | ther's three single step doncers gooin to contest for a copy ov 'baxter's saint's rest ' bun up wi' gilt edges | when aw heeard that aw ihowt well awm nooa saint misel but if awm a sinner awl have a bit o' rest whether it's baxter's or net | soa aw walked quitely off hooam thinkin ha thankful we owt to be at fowk 'll labor as they do to improve an elevate poor workin' fowk | that wor th' end o' my entertainment | sperrit rappin | did yo iver goa to a sperrit rappin' doo | aw did once but aw can't say it wor mich i' my line | it happen'd one setterdy neet 'at aw'd been to have a pint at th' rompin kittlin an' aw heeard some chaps say 'at ther wor baan to be a meetin i'th' owd wayvin shop o'th' sundy afternooin an' iver so mony mediums wor commin to tell all 'at wor gooin on i'th' tother world soa as awd nowt else to do aw went an' after a bit o' thrustin aw managed to get into a front seat: but they wor varry particlar who they let in | as aw wor set waitin for th' performance to begin aw thowt it luk'd varry mich like a inquest for ther wor one chap set o'th' end o't' table an' six daan each side an' they wor a lot o'th' rummest lukkin fowk aw'd seen for a long time | they all seem'd as if they wanted sendin aght to grass for ther faces wor th' color ov a lot o' tallow craps | in a bit they started an' we all sang a hymn an' varry weel it wor sung too considerin 'at that radical gravestoan letterer joined in it for if ther is ony body 'at can throw a whole congregation aght o' tune its owd cinnamon for he owt niver to oppen his maath onywhear unless all th' fowk is booath deeaf an' blind for th' seet o' his chowl is enuff to drive all th' harmony aght ov a meetin | aw dar wager a trifle 'at he'd be able to spoil th' jubilee | but as aw wor sayin we did varry weel considerin an' then th' cheerman gate up an' addressed a few words to us | he sed he'd noa daat 'at ther wor a goaid many amang us 'at didn't believe i' sperrits but he could assure us 'at ther wor moor i' sperrits sometimes nor what we imagined | he sed he knew one man 'at had been under th' influence ov a sperit 'at went hooam an' tell'd his wife sich things 'at made her hair stand ov an end an' when he gate up next mornin he knew nowt abaat it till he saw his wife wor i'th' sulks an' he ax'd her what ther wor to do |  ther's plenty to do aw think shoo says ha can ta fashion to put thi heead aght o'th' door | but tha can have yond nasty gooid for nawt as soain as tha likes for awst leeave thi if aw live wol awm an haar older | it's a bonny come off 'at me at's barn ommoss a duzzen children to thi should be shoved o' one side far a thing like yond |  why lass aw doant know what tha'rt talking abaat he sed tell me what tha meeans |  aw've noa need to tell thi shoo sed tha knows weel enuff an' aw believe ivery word 'at tha sed for they say 'at druffen chaps an' childer allus spaik th' truth an' awve suspicioned yond betty for a long time | what reight has shoo to be dawdlin abaat other fowks husbands for | if shoo wants a felly let her get one ov her own | but tha may tak her an' welcome an' mich gooid may shoo do thi an' may yo allus be as happy together as aw wish vo an' noa happier | drot her |  why did aw say owt abaat betty | tha mun tak noa nooatice o' owt aw say when aw come hooam throo a meetin tha sees sin aw wor made a medium aw ammot allus just i' mi reight senses an' it isn't me 'at spaiks it's what's in me |  eea an' it wor what wor in thi 'at spaik last neet | tha's noa need to tell me 'at tha worn't i' thi reight wit for tha hasn't been that for a long time but aw can tell thi one thing if tha'rt a medium awm net gooin to be made one | aw'll awther be one thing or tother soa if tha'd rayther have yond mucky trolly tak her an' may yo booath have a seed i' yor tooith an' corns o' yor tooas an' be fooarsed to walk daan th' hill all th' days o' yor lives that's what aw wish | he talked to her for a long time but it wor noa use for yo see shoo'd niver been enlightened an' all he could say didn't convince her 'at he worn't answerable for all he'd sed an' done but ov cooarse it's weel known 'at mediums arn't responsible for owt | after a few moor remarks an' relatin a few moor incidents he sed it wor abaat time to begin the serious business 'at had called us together an' he sed he hooap'd 'at if ony had came to scoff they'd remain to pay for they wor sadly i' need o' funds an' he hooap'd 'at iverybody wod respond liberally for sperits sich as they dealt in could not be getten o' trust although they had to be takken that way | then he knock'd th' table three times wi' his knuckles an' two o'th' fiddle faced chaps 'at wor set one o' each side on him began to wriggle abaat as if they'd getten th' murly grubs | stop stop  he sed one at once if yo pleease | brother sawny had better give his sperit backward for a few minutes wol we've done wi' brother titus's | soa sawny gave ovver shakkin hissen exceptin his heead an' jumpin onto his feet he sed if awve allus to give way to titus awm blow'd if awl come to edify yor lot ony longer |  husht husht | says th' cheerman the sperit has takken possession o' titus already | will ony o'th' unbelievers ax it a few questions | soa aw thowt aw mud as weel be forrad as onybody else soa aw stood up an' ax'd it furst what did they use to call thi |  mary jane wittering |  ha

a scoor |  are they happy or miserable |  some one way an' some another |  has ta seen onybody at's come latly |  nubdy but a chap they call 'profit |  what did they call him 'profit' for |  aw doant

for as monny year as he's charged fowk for feet o' gas 'at they've niver burned an' bi what awve heeard some o'th older end o'th sperits say it seems varry likely 'at eternity will ha getten farish in befoor he sees leet agean |  is he tormented wi' owt |  nowt but his conscience |  ha's that |  he hadn't one when he coom soa he's had to tak one at's been left bi somdy else an' it pricks him sadly |  then it seems his brass willn't save him |  noa for yo know 'wi whatsoever metre yo measure to yo it'll be measured agean |  is ther owt to ait an' drink i' yor quarter |  noa they've shut all th' shops up an' it's time they shut thine up for aw'm stall'd o' tawkin to thi | aw wor baan to ax him summat else but he began to wriggle agean an' th' cheerman sed th' sperit wor takkin its departure an' in a minute he oppened his een an luk'd raand as sackless as if he had nobbut just wakken'd |  nah my dear friend sed th' cheerman turnin an' spaikin to me aw hooap yo're satisfied | does ta believe i' what this sperit has communicated |  well aw says to tell the th' truth aw can't say 'at aw awther believe in it or net for aw've noa proof but if aw sed owt aw should be inclined to say 'net' but still it saands varry likely what one might expect an' that's all aw can say abaat it at present |  be sure tha comes to awr meetin next sundy he sed an' aw can see 'at tha'll sooin be one on us | an' for that reason aw niver went agean for aw couldn't help thinkin 'at if aw wanted to be a medium for sperits 'at awd rayther get a owd licensed haase an' start reight | wol this had been gooin on awd heeard a chap an' his wife 'at sat cloise to me talkin a gooid deal an' aw varry sooin fan aght 'at shoo wor tryin to mak him believe as mich i' sperits as shoo did an' ivery time th' medium answered one o' my questions shoo nudged him an' sed does ta hear that | its ivery word as true as gospel | does ta believe it nah | after shoo'd axed him two or three times he sed well its varry wonderful an' aw do begin to think 'at there's summat in it | a'a  shoo sed aw knew tha'd believe if aw could get thi to come | it wor sawney's turn next to be entranced as they call it an' as sooin as th' sperit had takken possession on him which seemed to be a varry hard task an' aw dooant know wether it went in at his maath or whear this woman 'at set aside o' me jumped up an' axed if shoo mud be allowed to put a few questions | th' cheerman sed shoo mud an' welcome soa shoo began ha old am aw fifty two |  am aw married or single married |  ha monny childer have aw four |  nah shoo says turning to her husband isn't it true |  yos its true enuff he sed aw believe there's summat in it but aw should like to ax a question or two misen |  why jump up then an' luk sharp an' start shoo

childer have aw two | two  then if my wife's four whose is tother two | as sooin as shoo heeard that an' befoor th' medium had time to spaik shoo seized hold ov her umbrella an'lauped off her seat towards whear th' medium wor set an' aw fancy if th' umbrella nop had made acquaintance wi' his heead i'th' way shoo'd intended 'at it wodn't ha taen long to untrance that chap | but th' cheerman saw her comin an' managed to stop it but it wor noa easy job to quieten her |  a'a tha lyin gooid for nowt | shoo sed has ta come here slanderin daycent wimmin | aw defy awther onybody i' this world or onybody i'th' tother to say owt agean my karractur | yor a lot o' himposters ivery one on yo that's what yo are | come on jim shoo sed to her husband as shoo seized hold ov his arm let us goa its nooan a fit place for gradely fowk |  dooant be i' sich a hurry he sed aw begin to think ther's summat in it |  summat in it | has ta noa moor sense nor to believe in a lot o' lyin vagabones like thease | let's get hooam they're nooan fit spots for daycent fowk an' aw hooap awst niver catch thi i' one agean | come on |  why tha browt me didn't ta | an' tha seemd to believe in it |  eea aw

or else awd rive his heead off nasty low lived sneak as he is | but come on hooam an if tha waits wol aw bring thi agean tha'll wait wol tha'rt a thaasand year old an moor ner that | they went aght an in a bit quietness wor restored | after a few moor remarks th' cheerman sed 'at it wor too far on i'th' day for ony moor sperits to be sent for for th' mediums had another meeting to attend that neet soa he read aght another hymn an' we tried to sing it to th' tune ov sweet spirit hear mi prayer but we couldn't for cinnamon wor too mich for us all he wor a deal better brayer nor prayer an' after one or two moor tries th' cheerman sed 'at unless that gentleman lukkin at cinnamon wod awther swallow a scaarin stooan an' a pund o' sweet sooap to clear his voice or else keep his maath shut we should have to leave singin aght o'th' question altogether | but cinnamon worn't to be put daan an' he tell'd th' cheerman 'at if he didn't know what singin wor he did an' when he wor in horstraly a voice what does ta know abaat horstraly tupheead tha niver went noa farther ner burtonheead i' all thi life | this ryled cim an' he up wi' a stooil an' whew'd it slap at th' cheerman | aw saw ther wor likely to be a row for whativer other sperit wor thear aw could see plain enuff 'at th' sperit o' mischief wor i' some on 'em soa aw crept up beside th' door an' pop'd aght an' left 'em to settle it as they could | aw met cinnamon th' next mornin an' aw saw 'at he'd a gurt plaister ov his nooas an' aw couldn't help thinkin what a blessin it wod ha been to some fowk if it had been stuck ovver his

for aboon a wick at after | when he turned aght next mornin to goa see th' superintendent he luked like a gate post 'at's studden in a rookery for six months | he'd to wait a bit afoor he could see

 thank thi' he said an' here's wishing at ther may niver be a 'mule i' th' garden' but what 'll be as easy getten shut on as this has been this afternooin |  gooid lad slinger | tha talks like a book

aght on thi nah |  well aw gate it swill'd aght on me ony way | but aw think some times' at it towt me a bit o' sense an' whoiver he is 'at wants to raise hissen up by poolin somdy else daan aw hope he'll get sarved ith' same way for when a chap shuts his een to ivery body's interests but his own he desarves to be dropt on but if we'd all to strive to lend one another a hand things ud go on a deal smoother an' as nooan on us is perfect we ought to try by kindness an' gooid natur an by practisin a bit o' patience to mak one another's rooad as pleasant as we con an if we stuck to that we should find fewer mules i' th' garden | o  an' soa that's th' tale abaght slinger is it ezra |  that's it uncle its done nah |  its abaght time it wor an' th' next time tha comes here an' brings a tale wi' thi mak it hauf as long an' it'll be twice as welcome | a neet at widup's rest | we've mooast on us at one 'time or another accidentally dropt amang company withaat havin ony idea o' spendin mich time wi' em an' yet we've kept stoppin an' stoppin feelin as happy as con be an' niver thinkin for a minit what a blowin up we should get when we landed hooam | an' aw've mony a time thowt 'at a body enjoys a bit ov a doo o' that sooart a deal better nor a grand set affair becoss when a body expects nowt it's hardly likely he'll be disappointed | well it wor one day last winter 'at aw'd walked monny a weary mile an' it wor commin dark when aw called at widdup's rest to see if aw could get owt to comfort me old inside for aw wor feelin varry wamley | as sooin as th' lonlady saw me shoo ax'd me to step forrads into another raam which aw did an' fan a few chaps set raand a fire fit to rooast a bull an' lukkin varry jolly | as sooin as they saw me they made raam for me at th' hob end an' began talkin to me as friendly as if they'd known me all ther life | aw sooin began to feel varry mich at hooam wi' em an' as th' lonlady browt in some basins o' hot stew 'at shoo wodn't be paid for an old trick to get fowk to spend twice as mich another rooad an' as another chap wod pay for all we had to sup an' smook aw thowt aw mud ha gone farther an' fared worse | it worn't long befoor some moor coom droppin in ha that happens aw dooant know but aw darsay you'll ha nooaticed it monny a time yorsen 'at if ther's owt stirrin 'at's cheap ther's allus a certain class o' fowk 'at drop in accidentally | after a bit we mustered a varry nice pairty ov abaat a dozen an' as iverybody wor tawkin at once we managed to mak a fairish din | but at last one o'th' chaps proposed 'at we should have a cheerman an' see if we couldn't conduct business in a moor sensible manner | ivery body sed hear hear | an' ov cooarse th' chap 'at wor standin sam wor voated in which seemed to give him mich satisfaction an aw couldn't help thinking 'at he worn't th' furst chap 'at had getten put i' sich a position for his brass an' net his brains | after order had been called two or three times bi every body i'th' place th' cheerman stood up an' sed gentlemen aw feel varry praad to okkipy this cheer an' aw'll do mi best to discharge the duties that disolves upon me at this important crikus an' aw think if ony body wants to order owt they'd better do it at once soas we shalln't have ony interruptions | we all shaated hear hear | agean an' th' lonlady wor i'th' raam befoor we'd time to ring th' bell | when we'd all getten supplied th' cheerman stood up agean an' knockin th' table wi' a empty ale bottle sed silence | we ivery one shaated silence | an' luk'd daggers at one another for makkin sich a din an' then he went on to say gentlemen as aw'm a stranger amang yo ov coorse aw dooant know mich abaat yo but aw should be varry mich pleeased if one on yo wod oblige bi singing a song |  nah ther's a chonce for thee cocky sed one |  tha knows aw connot sing sed cocky aw think ike ud do better nor me |  nay aw can sing nooan sed ike aw niver sang owt i' mi life but' rock a boo babby ' an' it's soa long sin aw've forgetten that but ther's old mosslump thear happen he'll give us one we all know he can sing |  dooant thee pitch onto me sed mosslump it'll be time enuf for thee to start o' orderin when we mak thi into th' cheerman what can't yo start wi' standhen for we know he can sing |  o standhen | they sed we'd forgetten standhen | he can give us a owd tory touch we know | up jumpt th' cheerman an befoor standhen had time to spaik he called aght mr standhen | we're all waitin for thy song an as cheerman o' this assembly aw expect thee to do what tha con to entertain this compny or otherwise aw shall vacate this cheer | as all th' glasses wor beginnin to get low they felt this to be an appeal to ther inmost sowl soa they all began perswadin standhen an' after a deeal to do he promised to try |  aw know awst braik daan befoor aw start he sed |  nay tha'll have to start furst sed one but we'll excuse thi if tha does if tha tries it'll show willin | after coughin once an' suppin twice he shut his e'en an' oppened his maath an' this is what coom aght: thou grand old church of england | though others raise their voice and try to stain thy spotless name thou still shall be my choice just as thou art i love thee thus and freely i confess i'd have thee not one jot the more nor yet one tittle less | those who would rob thee of thy rights and urge with specious tongue that theft by act of parliament can surely not be wrong | i'd have them leave thy sheltering wing and nevermore to dare to stand within thy courts of praise or taint thy house of prayer |oh  dear old church of england that points the way to heaven | amid a sad sad world of sin the truly only leaven | we leave thee to our father's care who knows thy needs the best convinced that he by aid of thee will leaven all the rest | when he'd finished they all knocked ther glasses on th' table bi way ov applaudin which th' lonlady hearin at once coom in an' ax'd if they wor callin | an' as all wor empty shoo luk'd varry hard at th' cheerman an' he nodded as befoor soa shoo gethered up th' empties an' called for liza to bring in them glasses which wor at once done an' showd a gooid deal o' foreseet on her part i' havin 'em ready | when all had getten sarved wi' hot watter an' given ovver crushin sugar th' cheerman announced 'at it wor mr standhen's call soa up jumped standhen an' said he couldn't do better nor call owd mosslump for a song | some moor applause followed this but they didn't knock th' tables wi' ther glasses this time becoss they wor too full | long befoor he'd done th' chaps had begun tawkin some abaat politics an some abaat knursticks an' when he sat daan th' cheerman wor th' only quiet chap i' th' lot an' he wor ommost asleep but mosslump comforted hissen wi' whisperin to me 'at classical mewsic wor varry little thowt on an' after a sigh a sup a shake ov his head an' another leet for his pipe he sat daan evidently detarmined not to be suited wi' owt i' th' singin way that neet | after th' cheerman had wakken'd up two or three called for cocky an' this time he gate up withaat ony excuses an' although he did rock backards an' forrads like a clock pendlum th' wrang end up yet aw must say he entered life an' soul into what he had to do an' in a voice 'at seemed three times too big for the size ov his carcass he sang lord john and john lord were both born on a day but their fortunes were different quite lord john was decked out in most gorgeous array as soon as he first saw the light | but poor johnny lord it's true on my word he'd no clothes to step into at all he'd no flannel to wrap he'd no nightgown or cap but was rolled in his poor mother's shawl | now it seems very strange yet it's true what i say and i hope you're not doubting my word and i'll tell what took place in a general way with lord john and with poor johnny lord the nurse took lord john and the doctors stood round and examined the child and his clothes whilst a fussy physician with looks most profound wiped his aristocratical nose |  it is i declare most uncommonly fair and its voice oh | how sweet when it cries it really would seem like the child of a dream or an angel just dropt from the skies | now it seems very strange c now poor johnny lord and his mother were laid both fainting and cold on the straw no doctors would come there unless they were paid or compelled to be there by the law | no comforting word heard poor mistress lord as o'er her babe bending she sat and each one who saw it cried with one accord what a little detestable brat | now it seems very strange c the two babes became men as the years rolled away | and lord john sported carriage and pair whilst poor johnny lord working hard for poor pay was content with what fell to his share | lord john went to races to balls and to routs and squandered his wealth with the gay till at last came the reaper and sought them both out and took lord john and john lord away | now it seems very strange c very soon a grand monument stood o'er lord john to show where the great man was laid but over john lord was no mark and no stone it was left as when left by the spade | but the time yet shall come when john lord and lord john shall meet in the realms far away when the riches and titles of earth are all gone then which will be greatest friends say | then though it seems strange yet it's true what you've heard and a lesson throughout it is cast which should comfort the poor working men like john lord for we all shall be equal at last | as sooin as he'd finished quaverin on th' last noat but one ther wor sich a knockin o' glasses an' thump in o' fists wol th' lonlady coom in agean an' th' cheerman felt it his duty to order as befoor which order th' lonlady worn't long i' executin |  gooid lad |cocky  sed ike if aw'd a voice like thee aw'd travel | tawk abaat sims reeves | he niver sang a song like that sin he wor creddled | nah maister cheerman keep up th' harmony we're mendin on it aw'm sure | 'gow aw'll have another pipe o' bacca o' th' heead on it' nay raylee aw niver did hear sich a song savin which he sat daan an' hid his astonishment behund a claad o' reek |  well sed th' cheerman as ike seems soa anxious aw think he'd better try an' let's see what he con do |  hear hear | on all sides an' two or three pulled him up whether he wod or net an' after a gooid deal o' sidelin abaat he axed if he mud have his cap on for he could niver sing withaat cap |  that's to keep th' mewsic throo flyin aght o'th' top ov his heead sed one | order  sed th' cheerman if ike wants his cap on let him have it may be he'll loise th' air withaat it | ike luk'd very solid for a minit an' then he struck a lively tune in a voice abaat as musical as a saw sharpener | when shoo ax'd me yesterneet what made mi heart so leet aw says why can't ta see it's 'coss mi love's come back | then aw gave her just a kiss an' shoo tuk it noan amiss an' aw'm feear'd aw'st brust wi' bliss for mi love's come back | o aw niver thowt befoor 'at sich joy could be i' stoor but nah aw'l grieve noa moor for mi love's come back | as mud ha been expected they applauded ike famously but th' cheerman wor hard asleep agean an' it tuk a gooid shakkin to wakken him an' then he didn't seem to be altogether thear an' as sooin as they left him aloan he dropt on agean |  aw think th' cheerman's ommost sewed up sed ike |  net he | he's noan sewed up sed mosslump it's that song o' thine 'at's sent him to sleep | who the shames does ta think could keep wakken for sich a song as that | aw knew tha'd do it as sooin as aw heeard thi begin |  come aw'll sing thee for a quairt any day sed ike tha fancies coss tha'd once a uncle 'at could sing a bit 'at ther's some mewsic born i' thee but if aw'd a public haase aw wodn't let thee sing in it for a paand for aw'll bet tha'd turn all th' ale saar |  tha am't worth tawkin to ike an' as for thee havin a voice why | tha arn't fit to hawk cockles an' mussels |  well an if aw did hawk 'em aw'd tak gooid care aw didn't sell thee ony unless aw gate th' brass befoorhand soa tha can crack that nut |  does ta mean to say 'at aw dooant pay mi way | aw've moor brass commin in ivery day nor tha can addle in a wick | aw saw it luk'd likely for a row brewin soa aw sed nah chaps we've had a verry nice evening soa far an' aw shouldn't like ony unpleasantness for yo see th' cheerman's had a drop too much an' aw think we owt to try to get him hooam if ony body knows wheear he lives | eea  sed one chap 'at had been varry quite all th' neet aw dooant think he'll pay for owt ony moor soa we mud as weel get shut on him |  ther's frank standin' at th' corner sed another aw dar say he'll tak him |  who's frank aw asked |  and bring suspicion upon us both | no said edwy one will be enough to report ill at once dunstan is an old fox | poor elfric could hardly get to bed and almost for the first time since infancy he laid himself down without one prayer | edwy left him in the dark and there he lay his head throbbing and a burning thirst seeming to consume him | long before morning he was very sick and when the bell was sounded for the early mass it need hardly be said that he was unable to rise | sigebert the physician who like redwald was in the confidence of the future king edwy came in to see him and asked what was the matter |  i am very sick and ill gasped elfric |  i suppose you have taken something that disagreed with you too much fish perhaps |  with a smile |  no no i do not i understand said the leech you will soon be better meanwhile i will account for your absence at chapel | here take this medicine you will find it relieve you | and he gave elfric a mixture which assuaged his burning thirst and bathed his forehead with some powerful essence which refreshed him greatly whereupon the leech departed | only an hour later and edred hearing from the physician of elfric's sudden illness came in to see the boy whose bright cheerful face and merry disposition had greatly attracted him | this was hardest of all for elfric to bear he had to evade the kind questions of the king and to hear expressions of sympathy which he felt he did not deserve | more than once he felt inclined to tell all but the fear of the prince restrained him and also a sense of what he thought honour for he would not betray his companion and he could not confess his own guilt without implicating edwy | poor boy | it would have been far better for him had he done so: he had taken his first step downward | chapter vi | lower and lower | it becomes our painful duty to record that from the date of the feast described in our last chapter the character of poor elfric underwent rapid deterioration | in the first place the fact of his having yielded to the forbidden indulgence and as he felt disgraced himself gave edwy as the master of the secret great power over him and he never failed to use this power whenever he saw any inclination on the part of his vassal to throw off the servitude | it was not that he deliberately intended to injure elfric but he had come to regard virtue as either weakness or hypocrisy at least such virtues as temperance purity or self restraint | the great change which was creeping over elfric became visible to others: he seemed to lose his bright smile the look of boyish innocence faded from his countenance and gave place to an expression of sullen reserve he showed less ardour in all his sports and pastimes became subject to fits of melancholy and often seemed lost in thought anxious thought in the midst of his studies | he seldom had the power even if the will to communicate with home | mercia was in many respects an independent state subject to the same king but governed by a code of laws differing from those of wessex and it was only when a royal messenger or some chance traveller left court for the banks of the midland avon that elfric could use the art of writing a knowledge he was singular in possessing thanks to the wisdom of his sire | so the home authorities knew little of the absent one for whom they offered up many a fervent prayer and of whom they constantly spoke and thought | and yet so mysterious are the ways of providence it seemed as if these prayers were unanswered seemed indeed yet they were not forgotten before god | seemed forgotten for elfric was rapidly becoming reckless | many subsequent scenes of indulgence had followed the first one and other haunts residences of licentious young nobles or taverns had been sought out by the youths and always by redwald's connivance | he was edwy's evil genius and always seemed at hand whensoever the prince sought occasion to sin | still he was not at all suspected by edred before whom he kept up an appearance of the strictest morality always punctual in his attendance at mass matins and evensong and with a various stock of phrases of pious import ready at tongue in case of need or opportunity of using them to advantage | to elfric his behaviour was always reserved yet he seemed even more ready to lend him a helping hand downward than did the prince | so time passed on weeks became months and christmas with all its hallowed associations had passed it had been elfric's first christmas away from home and he was sad at heart in spite of the boisterous merriment of his companions | the spring of the year 955 came on and lent drew near a season to which edwy looked forward with great dread for as he said there would be nothing in the whole palace to eat until easter and he could not even hope to bribe the cook | the canons of the church required all persons to make confession and so enter upon the fast tide having thus purified their minds x it may alas | be easily guessed how the guilty lads performed this duty how enforced confession only led to their adding the sin of further deceit and that of a deadly kind | thus they entered upon lent: their abstinence was entirely compulsory not voluntary and although they made up for it in some degree when they could get away from the palace yet even this was difficult for it was positively unlawful for butchers to sell or for people to buy meat at the prohibited seasons and the law was not easily evaded | but it was a prayerless lent also to elfric for he had alas | even discontinued his habit of daily prayer a habit he had hitherto maintained from childhood a habit first learned at his mother's knee | holy week came and was spent with great strictness the king seemed to divide his whole time between the business of state and the duties of religion | dunstan was absent at glastonbury but other ecclesiastics thronged the palace and there were few save the guilty boys and redwald who seemed uninfluenced by the solemn commemoration | but it must not be supposed that elfric was wholly uninfluenced: after the preaching of the passion by a poor simple monk on good friday he retired to his own little room where he wept as if his heart would break | had dunstan been then in town the whole story would have been told and much misery saved for elfric felt he could trust him if he could trust anybody but unhappily dunstan was as we have seen keeping passiontide at his abbey | still elfric felt he must tell all and submit to the advice and penance which might be imposed and as he sat weeping over his sin that good friday night with the thought that he might find pardon and peace through the great sacrifice so touchingly pleaded that day he felt that the first step to amendment must lie in a full and frank confession of all he knew he should grievously offend edwy and that he should lose the favour of his future king but he could not help it |  why oh why did i leave aescendune dear aescendune fool that i was i will go back | and a sweet desire of home and kindred rose up before him of his father's loving welcome his fond mother's chaste kiss and of the dear old woods and waters the hallowed associations of his home life | he rose up to seek father benedict determined to enter upon the path of peace at any cost when edwy entered | he did not see in the gathering darkness the traces of emotion visible on poor elfric's countenance and he began in his usual careless way how are you elfric my boy glad lent is nearly over | what a dismal time that wretched monk preached this morning |  edwy i am utterly miserable: i must tell all i cannot live like this any longer |  what a burst of penitence | go to confession to be sure it looks well and if one can only manage to get out a few tears they account him a saint tell me the receipt |  but edwy i must tell all |  not if you are wise |  why not | it is all in secrecy |  no it is not you will be required as a penance to go and tell the king all that we have done you may do so and i will manage to represent matters so as to throw the whole blame on you you will be sent home in disgrace | poor elfric hung down his head the thought of his disgrace reaching home had not occurred to him |  come said edwy i don't want to be hard upon you | cheer up my man | what have you done amiss | only enjoyed yourself as nature has guided you | why should you think god meant us to pass through life like those miserable shavelings edred delights to honour | cheer up elfric your bright face was never meant for that of a hypocrite | if you are so dreadfully bad you are in a pretty numerous company and i don't think the shavelings believe their own tales about fire and torment hereafter | they are merry enough considering | in short poor elfric's short lived penitence was given to the winds | edwy went alone to be shriven on the morrow | on easter day they both received the holy communion in the royal chapel | from that time remorse ceased to visit the heir of aescendune as if he had at last quenched the spirit and he became so utterly wild and reckless that at last dunstan thought it necessary to speak to him privately on the subject | it was nearly six months after easter | the boy entered the study set apart for the use of the great monk and statesman with a palpitating heart but he managed to repress its beatings and put on a perfectly unconcerned expression of countenance | he had gained in self control if in nothing else |  i wished to speak with you elfric said the abbot upon a very serious matter | when you first came here i was delighted to have you as a companion to the prince | you were evidently well brought up and bore an excellent character but i grieve to say you have greatly changed for the worse | are you not aware of it |  no father | what have i done | dunstan sighed at the tone of the reply and continued it is not any particular action of which i wish to accuse you but of the general tenor of your conduct | i do not speak harshly my boy but if truth be told you are as idle as you were once diligent as sullen and reserved as once candid and open: and my son your face tells a tale of even worse things and but that i am puzzled to know where you could obtain the means of self indulgence i should attribute more serious vices to you |  who has accused me father |  yourself that is your own face and manner | did you ever contemplate yourself in a mirror when at home | there is a steel one against that wall go and look at yourself now | elfric blushed deeply |  my face is still the same he said |  it is the same and yet not the same | innocence once took her place at its portals and had sealed it as her own the expression is all changed my boy i am absolutely certain that all is not well with you | for your own sake delay no longer to avoid the danger of losing your salvation for the habits you form now will perhaps cling to you through life | turn now to your own self confess your sin and be at peace |  i came to confession at shrovetide i am not required to come now am i | required  no my boy it is your own sense of guilt alone which should draw you | the church since there has been no public scandal leaves you to your own judgment at such a time as this | have you never felt such remorse of conscience as would tell you your duty | never  he thought of good friday and blushed |  your tone and words belie each other my boy | god grant you repentance you will not accept my help now but the time may come when you will seek help in vain | elfric bowed without reply and at a sign left the chamber | a few weeks later at the beginning of november edred left london for a tour in the west and quitted his nephews with more than his usual affection although his goodbye to elfric was more constrained for the good old king not knowing the whole truth was beginning to fear that elfric was a dangerous companion | he little thought that he was rather sinned against than sinning | dunstan was to follow him in a week and only remained behind to discharge necessary business | the heart of the amorous edwy beat with delight as he saw his uncle depart and he made arrangements at once to spend the night after dunstan's departure in mirth and jollity at the house of ethelgiva and her fair daughter | he came back after an interview with redwald on the subject and found elfric in their common study | there was an alcove in the room and it was covered by a curtain |  o elfric said the prince is it not delightful | the two tyrants the king and the monk will soon be gone | i wish the evil one would fly off with them both and when the cat is away will not the mice play | i have made all the arrangements we shall have such a night at the lady ethelgiva's |  how is the fair elgiva | it was now edwy's turn to blush and look confused |  i wish i had the power of teasing you elfric | but if you have a secret you keep it close | remember old dunstan vanishes on the fifteenth and the same evening oh won't it be joyful | but i am tired of work | come and let us take some fresh air | they left the room when the curtain parted and the astonished countenance of father benedict who had been quietly reading in the deep embrasure of the window presently appeared | he looked like a man at whose feet a thunderbolt had fallen and hastily left the room | the week passed rapidly away and at its close dunstan took his departure | a train of horses awaited him and he bade the young princes edwy and edgar farewell with the usual charge to work diligently and obey father benedict | that same night after the clerks had sung compline in the chapel and the chamberlain had seen to the safety of the palace edwy came quietly to the room of his page and the two left as on the first occasion | redwald attended them and just before the boat left the bank he spoke a word of caution |  i fear he said in a low tone that all is not quite right | that old fox dunstan is up to some trick he has not really left town |  perhaps he has a similar appointment tonight said edwy sarcastically |  i should keep mine though he and all his monks from glastonbury barred the way | they reached the castellated mansion of ethelgiva in due course and the programme of the former evening was repeated save that if there was any change the conversation was more licentious and the wine cup passed more freely | it was midnight and one of the company was favouring them with a song of questionable propriety when a heavy knock was heard at the door | the servants went to answer it and all the company awaited the issue in suspense | one of the principal domestics returned with haste and whispered some words into the ear of ethelgiva which seemed to discompose her |  what can this mean | she said |  a guard of soldiers demand admittance in the king's name | a louder knocking attested the fact |  you must admit them or they will batter the door down | edwy elfric | here hide yourselves behind that curtain it veils a deep recess | they had scarcely concealed themselves when dunstan entered attended by a guard of the royal hus carles |  what means this insolence | said ethelgiva |  no insolence is intended royal lady nor could be offered to the widow of the etheling by me replied dunstan but i seek to discharge a sacred trust committed to me | where are my pupils the prince edwy and his companion |  in their beds at the palace i should suppose |  nay be not so perfidious they are here lady and probably within hearing they must come forth or i must order the guard to search the house which i should regret |  by whose authority |  by that of the king whose signet is on my hand |  they are not here they left half an hour ago |  pardon me madam if i observe that we have watched the house for an hour |  had not this scene better terminate | he added with icy coldness | at this moment a favourite dog which edwy had often petted and which had entered with the guard found him out behind the curtain and in its vociferous joy betrayed the whole secret | confusion or smiles sat on every face save that of the imperturbable dunstan |  your dog madam is more truthful than its mistress he said bluntly yet quietly and then advancing to the recess he drew aside the curtain and gazed upon the discovered couple |  will you kindly return to the palace with me |  how dare you insolent monk intrude upon the pleasures of your future king |  i dare by the orders of the present king your royal uncle who has committed the whole matter into my hands and prince edwy in the discharge of my duty 'dare' is a superfluous word | will you as i said before both follow me if you are sufficiently masters of yourselves to do so | the import of all this was seen at a glance but there was no course but submission and edwy well knew how utterly indefensible his conduct was so with crestfallen gait he and elfric followed their captor to the river where was another large boat by the side of their own | they entered it and returned to the palace stairs much more sober than on previous occasions | chapter vii |  the king is dead long live the king | the unhappy elfric passed the night in a most unenviable frame of mind | he felt distinctly how utterly he was in the power of dunstan and that he could only expect to return home in disgrace yet there was no real repentance in all this: he had sinned and suffered but although he dreaded punishment he no longer hated sin | he scarcely slept at all and early in the morning he rose to seek an interview with edwy when he found that he was a prisoner | one of the hus carles posted at his door forbade all communication | early in the morning the bell sounded for the early service still he was not released and later his breakfast was brought to him after which he heard a heavy step approaching and dunstan appeared at the door of the sleeping chamber | he entered and gazed at elfric for a moment without speaking as if he would read his very heart by his face it was hardly comfortable |  elfric he said at last do you remember the warning i gave you six months ago |  no said elfric determined in desperation to deny everything |  i fear you are hardly telling me the truth you must remember it unhappy boy | why were you not warned in time | why did you refuse the advice which might have saved you from all this |  because it was my fate i suppose |  men make their own fates and as they make their beds so must they lie upon them however i have not come here to reproach you but to bid you prepare to return home |  home so soon | said elfric |  yes you must leave tomorrow when a messenger will be prepared to accompany you and to explain the cause of your dismissal from court to your father whom i most sincerely pity and let me hope that you will find leisure to repent of your grievous sin in the solitude of your native home |  must my father be told everything |  i fear he must: you have left us no choice and it is the better thing both for him and for you he will understand better what steps are necessary for your reformation a reformation i trust which will be accomplished in good time whereat no one will rejoice more than i | a pert answer rose to elfric's lips but he dared not give utterance to it the speaker was too great in his wrath to be defied with impunity |  farewell said dunstan would that i could say the word with brighter hopes but should you ever repent of your sin as i trust you may it will gladden me to hear of it | i fear you may have done great harm to england in the person of her future king but god forgive you in that case | well he niver went to th' schooil but yet he wor one o' th' mooast genius chaps 'at iver yo met i' yor life he'd a way ov his own o' dooin iverything | aw've heeard mi fayther tell 'at when he wor a lad ther wor a family o' five on 'em an' they all worked at th' factory an' as lads will they sometimes stopt aat soa lat ov a neet 'at they fan it varry hard wark to get up next mornin an' they had to be up at five o'clock 'coss they'd a long way to walk | nah mi gronfayther could nawther get up nor call aat but ha do yo think he managed to get' 'em aat o' bed | he used to allus keep abaat a barro looad o' brokken bricks at his bedside an' th' lads used to know as sooin as they felt 'em flyin abaat ther heeads 'at it wor time to be stirrin: one used to be enuff in a general way but th' second wor sure to do it even if he wor a hard sleeper an' if th' third didn't wakken him yo could book him for a tombstooan ony minit | nah that's what aw call technical eddication |  well if throwin bricks at a chaps heead is technical eddication aw dooant see 'at we want a schooil booard to taich us that said jabez for ther's lots 'at can manage that job withaat | nah awl tell yo what technical eddication is as yo all seem fast amang it |  well if tha can lawse us we desarve putting in a pooak an' shakkin up said michael low down but just loud enough to be heard |  aw heeard thi what tha sed michael but technical eddication is that sooart 'at taiches 'em a trade an aw think its a varry sensible thing 'an aw for one am i' favor ov a schooil board 'an if we dooant get one up ther's sure to be some o' them local board chaps at will an' aw consider this to be a varry gooid time to consider th' subject 'an depend on it them 'at start it will have th' best chonce o' being vooated in members an' as nooan on us but michael has ony public office aw beg to propooas 'at we form ussen into a quorum an mak application for a schooil booard an' aw beg also to propooas 'at michael is th' cheerman | this last proposition was a varry good hit for he knew that if michael had the chance to be chairman that he would not care a farthing what the object might be and there are a many like michael in that particular | michael hum'd and ha'd a few times but at last he overcame his scruples and said he didn't know but what it wor for th' best and if it wornt if it had to be done they might as weel have th' honor o' doin it as onybody else | they held a meeting but it would be useless for me to attempt to make you understand their arguments for i did not and i am pretty well convinced that they were similarly situated but at last it was unanimously resolved that they should have a school board and simon called for pen ink and paper to draw up a petition and he began in a very promising manner and proceeded very well until he came to the word technical then he scratched his head |  what's to do nah | said michael |  ha do yo spell technical | said simon is there a k in it |  ho eea | ther must be a k in it said dick let's see teck neck peck reck check deck leck hi | ther must be a k in it ther's a k i' all words o' that sooart |  well but aw believe ther isn't a k in it for all that said simon but whear's ther an old newspaper we can happen find it mentioned thear | so he got an old paper and whilst he was running down the columns the rest of the members were arranging when they could have th' furst feed at th' heead o' th' booard |  nah he said awve fun it |  an' ther's a k in it ov coarse sed michael |  as it happens tha'rt wrang for once said simon for ther isn't |  then ther owt to be that's all but aw dooant put ony faith i' newspapers for when aw wor wed they put in my name michael withaat a k |  well that wor reight enough ther isnt a k i' michael |  oh isnt ther varry gooid aw know 'at my dowter spells it wi' a k an' shoo's a pupil taicher soa shoo owt to know said michael |  thy dowter be blowed | tha wants to ram thy dowter daan ivery body's throit |  do aw awd be looath to ram her daan thy throit anyway tho it wodnt be sich a varry hard job for thi maath's ommost big enuff |  if its ony bigger accordingly nor thy nooas awl be smoored but tha con tak th' schooil board an thi dowter too for what aw care an' mich gooid may shoo do thi for awl niver be under a cheerman at spells michael wi' a k |  nah chaps said dick dardust dont yo fratch |  simon does reight to fratch said another michael has noa business allus to be draggin in his dowter if shoo is a schooil mistress | my wife's sister i' law had a hont 'at wor a schooil mistress an' aw dooant keep reapin it up | as each of them had had their pints replenished a number of times during the discussion the old saying that when drink's in wit is out began to be illustrated and there was such an uproar in the place that the landlord was compelled to send for some policemen to assist him in turning them out and when they had gone he muttered to himself as he picked up the broken pints schooil booards | its time they'd summat | what do they want wi' schooil booards | aw niver went to th' schooil an' luk at me | why aw could sup a 18 gallon to mi own cheek an net mak soa mich bother | whilst all this had been going on a few of the quiet and unassuming people of the village had met at the school room for the purpose of considering the same subject | the clergyman was in the chair and as might be expected the business was carried on in a very different manner and they decided to hold a public meeting and give all an opportunity to express their opinions | judge the dismay of the pot house solomons when they saw the village placarded with announcements on which the words school board were in very large letters | they at once set about raising some opposition for they felt themselves aggrieved | michael and simon o'th' lee happened to meet as they were going to work |  nah simon tha sees what a mess thy stupid wark's getten us into | if tha hadn't sed ther wornt a k i' technical it ud niver ha' come to this |  if tha hadn't sed 'at ther wor a k i' michael it would niver ha happened an' ther isnt a k i' technical |  well happen net but ther is a k i' michael becoss my dowter says thy dowter's a fooil | shoo taks after her faither | said simon as he walked away |  ha ha ha | well shoo hasnt lived to thy age withaat leearnin to know at ther's a k i' michael he shouted after him | but the public meeting was held and there was some very strong opposition and michael made a very long speech against school boards for he said that his dowter wor a pupil taicher an' shoo sed 'at schooil booards wor nobbut necessary i' them places whear they required 'em an' he should propooas 'at this meetin wor ov opinion 'at this question should stand ovver until his dowter wor old enuff to have a schooil ov her own an' if shoo couldn't eddicate fowk up to th' mark it wod be time enuff to have a schooil booard then |  gooid lad michael | said one |  michael wi' a k | said another |  goa home to thi dowter an' tell her to give thi brains a soap lather | shouted a voice that was verry like unto simon's | there was a good deal of uproar for a time but the meeting at length decided by a vote of ten to one in favour of a school board so the opposition did no good after all and michael's daughter will have to take her chance | tha caps me nah |  has ta heeard th' news |  niver a word | what's up |  old duke's getten wed |  nay tha caps me nah | an' who's th' gurt maddlin getten wed to | awst ha thowt he'd gettin to old to do that |  he's wed mary o' nathan's o'th' sludge hoil |  well tha does cap me

but shoo's a trimmer an' if he doesn't live to rue his bargain awst be chaited | shoo play'd him one o'th' nicest tricks th' day after they gate wed 'at awve heeard tell on for a long time |  ha wor that |  well tha sees he gate rayther fresh o'th' weddin day an' he wor varry dry when he wakken'd next mornin soa he sed he'd get up an' goa as far as 'th' quiet corner ' for a leck on but shoo tell'd him he'd ha to do nowt o'th' sooart for it wor ill enough to have a druffen chap at neet withaat havin one 'at started as sooin as he gate up | but he sed he should goa an' shoo said he should'nt an' they started o' threapin but what does shoo do when he worn't lukkin but shoves his peg leg up th' flue an' he sowt it all ovver but couldn't find it |  that wor a cunnin trick onyway but what sed duke |  he had to stop at hooam ov cooarse for shoo wod'nt tell him whear it wor until he promised net to goa near th' alehouse that day an it had getten towards neet when he promised and as shoo'd kept a gooid fire all th' time it had getten a fairish warmin and' old duke noa sooiner gate it on an' wor walkin abaat a bit nor it mashed like a pot an' he fell his whoallength on to th' floor with his heead i'th' coilskep |  nay tha does cap me nah | ther'd be a bonny rumpus awl bet | did ta hear |  aw heeard nowt noa farther nobbut some ov his chums gate to know an soa they made a subscription an' bowt him another an' they had it painted red white and blue an' sent it lapt up i' silk paper | old duke wor ommost malancholy when he saw it but mary nobbut laft an started on an' blackleeaded it an' in a varry little time he wor set i'th' 'quiet corner ' wi as handsome a peg leg as tha'd wish to see | they chaff him a gooid bit abaat weddin mary but he taks it all i' gooid part an' they've sent all sooarts o' presents to him | one day last week they sent him a creddle an' mary wor soa mad wol shoo gate th' blocker an' wor baan to chop it into chips and wol shoo wor stormin on a little lad coom to th' door an' sed 'please aw've browt a pair o' specteckels for old duke to rock th' creddle in '| an' shoo catched him a drive at side o'th' heead wol his een fair blazed an th' specteckels flew into th' middle o'th' rooad |  well but it wor hardly reight on her to claat th' lad coss he knew nowt abaat it |  why tha sees shoo didn't just think abaat it but shoo made it all reight at after an gave him a butter cake an' old duke sam'd up th' specs an' after saigin th' heead off he turned th' creddle into a manger for his donkey |  well tha caps me | but has ta heeard abaat that barrel o' ale runnin away throo old nipsomes tother wick |  noa ha wor that | aw hardly thowt he'd ony ale 'at had strength to run away |  o but he has for th' last gill awe gate fit

nineteen twentieths he's baan to keep for hissen an' his relations are to have th' furst chonce o'th' other so as it'll be as mich a family affair as possible | does ta see that's done soa as if ivery

for ommost ivery body's getten to know an' if onnybody livin abaat that church wants a sheep's heead an' a pluck they order th' butcher to send 'em a new taan boggard |  well tha caps me nah |  gooid

day an' he must ha getten moor nor he could carry an' tha knows as weel as me 'at he can sup moor nor what ud mak some fowk druffen an' walk as steady as if he'd swallow'd a church steeple an' all an' he ligg'd him daan o' some sheets o' wool 'at wor bi th' rooad side an' as musty wor goain past he saw him an' soa he thowt he'd have a marlock an' he went an' fun up some ov his chums an' they gate sooit an' daub'd his face wol he luk'd war nor old scrat hissen |  nay fer sewer | why they mud easily do that aw believe for he's nooan a gooid favvor'd chap at th' best hand |  noa he isn't but they worn't content wi' that but musty went an' gate some sooart o' paader 'at they use to dye red worset an' sich like stuff wi' an he tuk off his cap an' sprinkled it all amang his toppin an then they left him an' in a bit he wakken'd up for all th' childer ith district wor gethered raand him starin at him | just then musty 'at had been waiting abaat reckoned to come past in a great hurry an' as sooin as he saw sucksmith he set up a gurt shaat o' laffin an says whativer has ta been doain aw niver saw sich a freet i' mi life | sucksmith wor reight gaumless for a while but he says what is ther to laff at | did ta niver see me befoor thinks ta |  well aw niver saw thi luk like that affoar onnyway | whoiver is it 'at's been playin thee this trick |  what trick does ta meean | he sed |  why doesn't ta know at thi face is all daubed wi sooit | sucksmith put up his hand to feel an' when he saw his fingers all grimed he sed aw wish aw knew who'd done this musty awd be straight wi' him an sooin too | to think 'at a chap connot fall asleep in a kristine country withaat havin his face painted war nor a paysayger but awst find it aght someday |  well aw think its th' best plan to goa wi' me to th' blue dunnock sed musty an' gie thisen a gooid wesh | soa they went an' all musty's mates wor set waitin in another raam | th' landlady wor varry gooid i' findin him some sooap an' watter o'th' sinkstooan an' he started to give hissen a reight gooid swill an as sooin as th' watter gate to this stuff 'at they'd put ov his heead it began to roll daan th' color o' blooid an' as sooin as he oppen'd his e'en he saw it an' he thowt at first it must be his nooas 'at wor bleedin an' as th' landlady worn't abaat he blew his nooase oth towel to see but it worn't then he put up his hand to his heead an' thear it wor sure enuff | he ommost fell sick when he saw it an' he called for musty as laad as he could to see what wor to do |  whativer's th' matter wi me thinks ta musty | just iuk awm bleedin like a pig |  a'a dear a'a dear | why tha must ha brokken a blooid vessel |  aw think awve brokken two or three sed sucksmith but what mun aw do |  sewse thi heead wi cold watter ther's nowt stops bleedin like cold watter | why if tha gooas on tha'll bleed to th' deeath |  aw begin to feel faint already sed sucksmith as he started o' throwin moor watter on his heead but th' moor he put on an' th' moor blooid seemed to come an' he sed oh dear | aw believe awm done for this time musty doesn't ta think tha'd better send for a doctor | when he lifted up his heead musty wor foorced to turn away for a minit to get a straight face for sucksmith's wor dyed th' color ov a raw beef steak an' his heead luk'd like one o' them red door mats 'at tha's seen | but musty advised him to goa on wi' th' watter an' he did an' in a while it begun to have less colour in it an' sucksmith's mind began to feel a bit easier |  aw think its ommost gien ovver nah he sed but luk at mi hands | why they're like a piece o' scarlet cloath |  eea an thi face is th' same tha luks to me as if tha'd getten th' scarlet fayvor an' awm sure ther's summat nooan reight wi' thi but wipe thisen an' come into tother hoil ther's some o' thi mates thear an' we'll see what they say | sucksmith did as he wor tell'd an' went into tother raam with musty but ther wor sich a crack o' laffin as sooin as he showed his heead wol they mud ha fell'd him wi' a bean |  nah lads sed musty yo shouldn't laff at a chap's misfortunes an' awm sure ther's summat matter wi awr friend sucksmith aw tell him it must be th' scarlet fayvor '|  well aw niver saw sich a heead i' mi life sed another but its nooan th' scarlet fayvor my belief is its th' cattle plague an if it is an' th' police gets to know they'll have him shot bi th' heart will they for they've orders to destroy ivery livin thing 'at shows ony signs o' havin it | but whear has ta been to get it thinks ta |  nay awve been nowhere 'at aw know on sed sucksmith aw felt all reight a bit sin an' aw ligg'd daan o' some sheets o' wool an' fell asleep an' aw niver knew aw ail'd owt wol aw coom in here to wesh me |  why then it will be th' cattle plague its nowt else ther's a deal o' sheep had it lately an' varry likely that's some o' ther wool 'at tha's been sleepin on | but ha does ta feel |  oh aw feel varry mich alike all ovver awm feeared its up we me ommost an' this has come for a warnin for aw havn't behaved misen reight latly | but if awm spared to get ovver this awl alter |  why tha luks as if tha'd awther getten a warnin or a warmin bith color o' thi face sed one but aw think tha'd do wi' a glass o' summat to cooil thi daan a bit a red indian's a fooil to thi |  it must be summat serious sed another are ta th' same color all ovver |  aw dooant know awm sure an' | aw havn't strength to luk he sed | but one o'th' chaps roll'd up his briches slop to see nay thi leg is all reight |  well sed musty tha knows it may be soa for we've heeard tell o' th' fooit and maath desease an' this may be th' heead an' hand complaint | but what do yo think it'll be th' best for him to do |  i shuild advise him to goa hooam at once but if ony body should see him they'll varry likely tak him for a literary chap becoss he's so deeply red |  well whether they tak him for a little hairy chap or net he'll pass for a red hairy chap an' noa mistak sed hiram | but sucksmith fancied he felt soa waik wol he didn't think he'd be able to walk hooam soa after all biddin him gooid bye for fear they mud niver see him agean an one chap axin him to be sure an' tell his first wife if he met her up aboon 'at he'd getten wed to her sister they sent him hooam in a cab |  nay fer sewer | whativer wi ta say | an' whativer did their margit say when shoo saw him | he must ha luk'd a pictur |  nay aw dooant know what shoo sed but ther wor a rare racket ith' hoil awl a warrant thi | but th' gurt softheead stuck in it 'at he wor poorly an' as shoo saw he wornt sober shoo humoured him wi lettin him goa to bed | next mornin he'd come to his senses a bit soa shoo let him have sich a bit o' tongue as he hadn't had latly for tha knows shoo's a glaid when shoo starts for if awd to say quarter as mich to my felly as shoo says to him sometimes he'd niver darken th' door agean | he began to see what a fooil they'd been makkin on him an' he gate up intendin to goa to his wark but when he saw hissen ith' seamin glass he couldn't fashion an' soa he began o' weshin hissen first i' cold watter an' then i' hot but it wor what they call a fast color an' he couldn't get it to stir do what he wod |  what mun aw do margit | he sed when he'd swill'd his heead wi' hot watter wol it wor hauf boiled th' moor aw wesh it an' th' breeter it seems to get | if iver aw get all reight agean ther's somdy'll want a new suit o' clooas but it'll be a wooden en |  hold thi noise lumpheead shoo sed an' get thi braikfast an awl see if aw connot do summat for thi | aw expect it'll have to be scaar'd off | soa after th' braikfast shoo made him ligg daan o' th' hearthstooan an' shoo gate some wire scale an' started o' scrubbin one side ov his head as if shoo'd been polishin th' fender but he couldn't stand that an' he laup'd up an' donced up an' daan th' hoil sayin all sooarts o' awkward things |  what the dickens are ta thinkin on he sed does ta fancy awm made o' cast iron |  aw dooan't know what tha'rt made on but aw know tha artn't made o'th' reight sooart o' stuff for a fayther ov a family to be made on but if tha connot get it off thisen an' tha weant let me tha'll be forced to stop as tha art that's all | an' away shoo flew aat o' th' haase and left him |  nay fer sewer | an' whativer did he do | well he set daan and studied a bit then he sent for a doctor net becoss he felt poorly but becoss he wanted to know what to do to get it off | soa th' doctor coom an' they say he couldn't spaik for iver soa long for laffin at him an' he tell'd him he'd be monny a week befoor he gate reight an' it wod have to wear off by degrees but his hair he sed wod niver be reight soa he mud as weel have it shaved off sooin as lat | soa he sent for timmy th' barber an' had it done an' when his wife coom back thear he wor set lukkin for all th' world like a lot o' old clooas wi' a ball o' red seealin wax stuck at th' top an' thear he is i'th' haase nah whear he'll ha to stop wol his hair grows agean |  nay fer sewer | an does he niver goa aat |  niver he did goa to th' door one day when hiram's little lass went to borrow th' looaf tins but shoo wor soa freetened wol shoo ran hooam an' her mother says shoo believes shoo's gooin to have soor een mun he's flaysome to luk at an' th' child has niver been like hersen sin an' shoo connot sleep ov a

it costs him a paand an' musty says he doesn't care ha sooin for he wod be sure ov a bit o' summat to ait if he wor sent daan th' rails but aw think it'll get made up agean | but awve left yond child ith' creddle bi hersen soa aw mun be off | away shoo went an' sally watched her aat o'th seet an' then sank into a cheer roll'd up her arms in her appron stared into th' fire an' sed nay fer sewer |

what time does ta think tha'll ha done weshin |  abaat four o'clock if awm lucky |  well wi ta step across an' have a cup o' teah wi us |  eea aw dooant mind if aw do |  owd tommy |  a yorkshire sketch | of all the seasons of the year that portion when winter treads upon the skirts of the retiring autumn always seems to me to be most deeply fraught with sorrowful associations | a few short weeks before one has beheld the year in stately pride loaded with blessings and adorned in nature's most luxurious garb waters in silvery streams have lightly leaped and bounded in the shadow of the waving ferns and little flowers have nodded on the brink and peered into the crystal depths as though in love with their reflected loveliness the little hills have decked their verdant breasts with floral gems and the frowning crags have seemed to smile and from their time worn crevices have thrust some wandering weed whose emerald tints have lent a soothing softness to the hard outline of their rugged fronts | the feathered songsters on untiring wing have flitted in the sunny sky pouring forth melodious sounds in thankfulness and joy as though their little hearts were filled too full of happiness and overflowed in drops of harmony | light fleecy cloud's like floating heaps of down have sailed along the azure sky casting their changing shadows on the earth whilst sighing winds have whispered soothing songs amongst the rustling leaves and ripened fruits have hung in tempting show their sun burnt fronts courting the thirsty lip to tell us in their silent eloquence that the year has gained its prime | even when the ice king reigns and howlling storms drive with remorseless fury o'er the plains or wreck their vengeance on the sturdy woods roaring amongst the pliant branches and entwining around the knarled trunks uprooting some as though in sport to show its giant strength | and the cascade which formerly leaped forth from sylvan nooks where the wild flowers half hid its source and bathed themselves in the ascending mist now roaring down in sullied swollen force bearing along the wrecks of summer beauties tumbling and hissing through its frost bordered bed growling in foaming rage around the rocks which here and there protrude their sullen face to check its mad career even this has much of majesty and beauty and claims our admiration | but when some glories of the autumn yet remain and e'er stern winter has usurped the sway one wide wide field of death and desolation is all that's left for man to ponder over fading flowers trembling and shrinking in the raw cold blast half naked trees that day by day present a more weird aspect fields still green but stripped of every gem whilst still some russet warbler may be heard chirping in sorrow and distress and heavy looking clouds anxious to screen the cheering ray which now and then bursts forth with sickly smile that seems like ill timed mirth amongst the dead | on such a time as this and in the early sabbath morning might be seen a stalwart farmer strolling o'er the hills which command a view of the little but interesting village of luddenden | i do not think that the dreary look of decaying beauties had much effect upon him the pale blue smoke that issued from his mouth in measured time seemed to afford him every consolation | he evidently saw some one approaching in whom he was interested | having satisfied himself that he was not mistaken he began talking aloud: oi | that's him sure enough nah whativer can owd tommy want laumering over thease hills at this time o'th' morning | he's a queer chap takkin him all i' all an' still if ought should happen him aw doant know where they'd find his marrow he's been th' same owd tommy iver sin aw wor a lad an' aw'm noa chicken nah he said stroking a few grey hairs which like a tuft of frosted grass adorned his ruddy cheeks | aw sud think he's saved a bit o' brass bi this time for he wor allus a nipper but he wor allus honest an' it isn't ivery man yo meet i'th world 'at's honest but aw doant think tommy ud wrang ony body aght o'th' vally o' that saying which he snapped his finger and thumb together to denote its worthlessness | a few minutes more and tommy might be plainly seen slowly ascending the somewhat rugged road toward the spot where stood the farmer leaning against the wall awaiting him | i could not better occupy the time that intervenes than endeavour to picture the approaching traveller | his age i would not dare to guess he might be 60 or he might be 90 | he was a short thick set man and rather bent but evidently more from habit than from weight of years | he wore a long blue coat which plainly spoke of years gone by and bore in many places unmistakable evidence that tommy was no friend to tailors beneath this an old crimson plush waistcoat that had long since done its duty some drab knee breeches and a pair of dark grey stockings which hid their lower extremities in a pair of shoes about large enough to make two leather cradles on his head a hat that scorned to shine and in his hand he carried an oaken staff his small grey eyes glistened with a spark of latent wit whilst on his face was stamped in unequivocal characters some quaint originality |  gooid morning tommy said the farmer |  gooid morning dick replied tommy it's a nice day ower th' head but fearful heavy under th' fooit |  you're reight said dick but where are yo trapesing to this morning |  waw aw'm gooin as far as dick's o' tom's at th' durham to get my tooa nails cut said tommy |  well yo'll happen bait a bit and ha a wiff o' bacca wi' me for its a long time sin aw saw yo afoor said dick |  waw aw dooant mind if aw have a rick or two but aw munnot stop long for it luks rayther owercussen up i'th' element but ha's that lad o' thine getting on sin he wed quiet hannah lass | aw've wondered sometimes if he wod'nt rue his bargain is shoo as fat as sho wor |  eea shoo keeps i' varry gooid order shoo puts her mait into a better skin nor th' mooast they didn't hit it soa well at th' furst for shoo wor varry waspish an' tha knows awr joa's as queer as dick's hatband when he's put aght a bit | one morning abaght a wick after they wor wed joa woran't varry weel an' had to ligg i' bed a bit shoo gate up to muck th' beeas for shoo can do a job like that tha knows when shoo's a mind | eea eea  said tommy noabody better shoo's a pair o' gooid end shoo's nooan afeared o' dipping her finger i' water nut shoo |  well aw tell thi shoo gate up an' in a while shoo call'd aght 'at his porridge wor ready when he liked to come daan an' then shoo went aght | soa in a bit he gate up an' th' pan wor stood o' th' rib flopping away rarely | well he gate a plate an' thowt he'd tern' em aght to cooil when asteead o' porrige aght come th' dish claat slap on to his fooit talk abaght single step doncing tha should just ha seen him he ommost lauped clean ower th' breead flaik an' thear shoo stood grinning at him throo th' winder an' he wor soa mad he wuthered th' pan fair at her head he miss'd his aim an' knock'd th' canary cage to smithereens th' cat gate th' burd an' th' pan fell into th' churn | nah what wod ta think ov a thing like that |  waw its just loike one ov her tricks tha knows shoo wor allus a trimmer o' one dick |  shoo wor tommy an shoo allus will be to her deeing day | it put awr joa into a awful passhian but shoo didn't care a pin shoo said shoo'd lived too long near a wood' to be fear'd ov a hullet but they're as reight as dick and liddy nah | aw'll tell thi ha that happens | tha knows awr joa allus thowt a deeal ov his mother an he wanted th' wife to do i'th' same way an one morning shoo' wor neighding th' dooaf when joa says 'mally' that isn't th' way to neighd my mother allus 'used to do soa ' an' he wor baan to show' haa shoo made noa mooar to do but lauped into th' middle o'th' bowl wi' her clogs on an' started o' traiding it wi' her feet an' shoo says 'does thi mother do soa '| after that he let her have it mooastly to her own way an' they seem to get on varry weel amang it nah an' if he keeps steady they're putting it together nicely | an' what have yo fresh tommy |  nay nowt 'at means ought aw think dick but aw'd like to been pooisened t'other wick but as luck let aw wor noa war | pooisened  tommy nay surelee nut |  yos but aw had tha sees aw live at th' ee'gurnard an' aw'd just been into th' mistal wi' young maister william an' he'd been holding th' canel for me whol aw siled th' milk an' he wor full ov his marlocks an' bluzzed th' canel up mi nooas an' put it aght he's a shocker |  waw tommy yo wodn't be pooisened wi' a canel aw'll niver believe |  noa but as aw wor telling thi aw'd been i'th' mistal an' aw went into th' kitchen for a bit o' summat to ait | aw saw some fat o'th' ooven top in a pot soa aw gate some breead an' ait it up | aw thowt it wor fearful gooid an' savored summat aw'd niver had afoor but just when aw'd finished it one o'th' young mistresses come daan an' axed me what aw'd done wi' what wor i'th' pot | soa aw tell'd her aw'd etten it | etten it '| shoo skriked | 'etten it | why ' shoo says 'yo'll be pooisened tommy its pumatum '| well aw says 'pumatum or net aw've etten it ' an' away shoo ran an' browt th' maister an' th' mistress an' all t'other fowk i'th' haase an' rarely they laffed tha minds but maister made me a glass o' rum to settle it an' aw felt noa mooar on it |  well said dick tha mayn't feel it nah but aw shouldn't be capped if thi inside wor to grow full o' ringlets |  niver heed that they'll keep mi belly warm said tommy but th' bacca's done soa aw mun be making mi way shorter | gooid day dick |  gooid day tommy | aw hope tha'll have a fine day for thi walk |  eea eea aw hope aw shall but if it rains aw sholl'n't melt |  nooah but its rayther coolish |  it'll be warmer as it gets ooater dick | gooid day | and thus the two friends parted each smiling at the quaint humor of the other the one to climb seven miles of rough and heavy road to get his toe nails cut and the other to pay an early visit to his son and rest his limbs which by six days of willing toil had earned a sabbath's rest | he walked slowly musing as he went and every now and again making audible the current of his thoughts |  its monny a long year sin aw saw owd tommy before an' it may be monny a long year before aw see his face agean aw think owd time must use him wi' a gentler hand nor he uses me | aw remember th' first time aw saw him he wor coming past th' churn milk joan wi' a lump o' parkin in his hand as big as awr ooven top an' that wor th' day 'at jenny an' me wor wed | it seems like a dream to me nah | poor jenny if there's a better place tha'rt nooan soa far off thear | and then he paused to wipe the heavy drops from off his cheeks |  aw thowt aw'd getten ower this sooart o' thing nah he sed but aw believe aw niver shall | its just five year come easter sin aw laid her low an awve niver been able to aford a grave stooan for her yet but aw can find that bit o' rising graand withaat a mark an prize it nooan the less | but its noa gooid freating abaght things we cannot help | aw'll have another reek or two an' goa an' see awr joa | so filling his little black clay pipe with the fragrant weed which for convenience he carried loose in his waistcoat pocket he puffed his cloud of incense in the air and hastened on to gain his journey's end | a walk of a few minutes brought him to the door of a low whitewashed farm house around which the cans were reared ready to be filled with the morning's milk | he ventured in first carefully removing all the mire from his shoes lest he should soil the nicely sanded floor and drawing up the old arm chair which shone like polished ebony he looked around the strange apartment |  its a queer fancy he said at last at mally should be soa fond o' pots what ther's mooar here nor what ud start a shop it saves th' expense of slapdashing onyway | and he was right for from floor to ceiling and along the old oak beams appeared one medley of crockery pots of all sizes cups and plates of all shapes and patterns were hung or reared against the wall until it was impossible to find another place where one might be displayed and on the mantle shelf a long array of china images of fortune telling gipsies guarded at each end by what was supposed to represent a dog they might resemble dogs but surely such a breed exists not now for if there was a point about them to recommend it was what mally often said they ait nowt | in a short time both joe and mally made their apperance health bloom on their cheeks and with a hearty welcome prepared the morning's meal | a clean white cloth spread on as clean a table the requisite pots the fresh churned butter and the wheaten bread was all that was displayed to tempt them to the meal but it was all that was required for appetite gave relish to the plain repast and many a wealthy man in stately rooms with every luxury around might well have envied them their simple fare sweetened by labor and so well enjoyed whilst savory meats of which they never knew in vain invited him whose satiated tastes loathed every dish | but the old farmer did not seem at ease and when the meal was over after a short conversation he bade them both good day and turned his steps towards his lonely home | perhaps it was the son who called up in the old man's mind some thoughts of former days or perhaps the train of thought he had indulged in previously might have laid a load of gloom upon him but be it as it may he seemed inclined to spend the day under his own roof tree | the winter came and spread its spotless snows o'er hills and dales the wild winds wailed the woodman's axe echoed amidst the woods the song birds fled the dauntless redbreast twittered on the window sills the cawing rooks wended their weary way in solemn flight | the spring again like a young bashful maid came smiling upon old winter's track the field's looked gay again and trees seemed vieing which could first be drest in verdant green | the summer followed on the sun shone o'er the fields of ripening grass the mowers scythe was dipped in fragrant dews and flora bounteously bestowed her favorite flowers | autumn succeeded and once more the' eye was gladdened with the bearded grain waving in golden splendour in the breeze again the luscious fruits are tempting one to pluck and soon again the year weary with its labors prepares to sleep and desolation reigns | 'tis sunday morning and the sun looks down through murky mists the ground is slightly hardened with the nipping frost here and there some hardy flower endeavours to look gay: the tolling bell rings out its morning call and straggling groups wend their way to worship in the village church | but on the hill which rises high above was stood a man in deep and earnest thought | one could scarcely have believed that the pale aged looking man who dressed in sombre black was standing and looking over the quiet scene was the stalwart farmer who just one year before was holding converse with old tommy but he begins to speak |  its just twelve months to day he said sin aw wor talking to him o' this varry spot an nah he's gooan an awm left to attend his funeral: ther's nowt to feel sorry for 'at aw know on but when an owd face is noa mooar 'at one's been used to see it tells a tale 'at's easy understood it leaves a gap i'th' world 'at's never shut it bids us to prepare an reckon up awr life to

druidical times consisting of sixty huge stones arranged in a circular form with an entrance at the northeast while a single rock or large stone the largest of all stood apart from the circle as if looking down into the valley beneath |  xix what can be the origin of this circle | said alfred |  it belongs to the old days of heathenesse before the welsh were conquered by the romans perhaps before our blessed lord came into the world these stones were placed as you now see them replied father cuthbert |  what purpose could they serve |  for their devil worship i suppose you see those five stones which stand at some little distance |  they are the five whispering knights said oswy |  they are the remains of a cromlech or altar whereon they offered their sons and daughters unto devils and shed innocent blood wherefore the lord brought the romans upon them |  but the romans were idolatrous too |  yet their religion was milder than the one it superseded | jupiter required no human sacrifices and even otherwise god has said that the wicked man is often his sword to avenge him of his adversaries |  oswy looks as if he had a tale to tell |  speak out oswy and let us all hear said the good father |  well then said oswy these were not once stones at all but living men a king five knights and sixty soldiers who came to take long compton the town down there in the valley but it so happened that a great enchanter dwelt there and being out that morning he saw them coming muttered his spells and while the king that stone yonder was in front looking down on his prey the five knights all whispering together and the sixty soldiers behind in a circle they were all suddenly changed into stone | they all laughed heartily at this and leaving the rholdrwyg stones turned aside to the hospitable hall where they ought to have spent the previous night | so delighted was the thane of rholdrwyg or rollrich to receive his guests that he detained them almost by force all that day and it was only on the morrow that he permitted them to continue their journey | they joined the foss way again after a few miles at stow on the wold the road was so good that they succeeded in reaching cirencester the ancient corinium that night a distance of nearly thirty miles | here they found a considerable population for the town had been one of great importance and was still one of the chief cities of southern mercia full of the remains of her departed roman greatness with shattered column and shapely arch yet diversifying the thatched hovels of the mercians | two more days brought them to bath but the old roman city had been utterly destroyed and long subsequently the english town had been founded upon its site so that there seemed no identity between bath and aqua solis such as prevailed between cirencester and corinium | one day's journey from bath brought them at eventide within an easy day of glastonbury so that they paused in their journey for the last time at a well known hostelry chiefly occupied by pilgrims bound for glastonbury for the morrow was a high festival or rather the commencement of one and dunstan was expected to conduct the ceremonies in person | so crowded was the hostelry that alfred and his revered tutor could only obtain a small chamber for their private accommodation while their servants were forced to content themselves with such share of the straw of the outbuildings as they could obtain in company with many others | it was still early when they stopped at the inn for one of their horses which they had purchased by the way had broken down so completely that they could not well proceed and they were about to enter a dark and dangerous forest full of ravenous bears and wolves which had already cast its shade upon their path | but this was not an uncommon feature in english travelling of that century when there were no horses to be hired at the inns and travellers could only purchase the animals they needed if there were any to be sold the forest too was reported to be the haunt of freebooters and men dared to affirm that they were encouraged by the king to prey upon the fraternity at glastonbury | still the dangers of the forest did not deter alfred who dearly loved woodland scenery and sport from strolling therein when their hasty meal had been despatched weary of the continuous objurgations and smalltalk of the crowded inn | he had wandered some distance lost in thought when all at once he started in some surprise for the spot on which he was seemed familiar to him although he had never been in wessex before | yes he certainly knew the glade with the fine beech trees surrounding it: where could he have seen it before | all at once he remembered his dream in the ruined temple and started to discover the secret foreknowledge he had thus possessed | he wandered up and down the glade till it became dusk and then shook off the thoughts to which he had been a prey and started to return to the inn when to his dismay he found he had forgotten in which direction it lay | while seeking to find the path by which he had entered the glade he suddenly noticed a beaten track between two huge rocks which seemed to point in the direction he had come and yet which he recognised as the path he had been bidden to follow in his dream | he hesitated not but committed himself to it while darkness seemed to increase each moment | he was beginning to fear the dangers of a night in the woods when he was startled by a sound as of many low voices and at the same moment became conscious that a light was tinging with red the upper branches of the trees at no little distance as if proceeding from some fire hidden by the formation of the ground | at first he thought that he was in the neighbourhood of outlaws and tried to retire but as in his dream he felt so strong an impulse to discover the party whom the woods concealed that he persevered | suddenly he stopped short for he had come to the edge of a kind of natural amphitheatre a deep hollow in the earth the sides of which were covered with bushes and trees while the area at the bottom might perhaps have covered a hundred square yards and was clothed with verdant turf | not one but several fires were burning and around them were reclining small groups of armed men while some were walking about chatting with each other | alfred gazed in much surprise for the party did not at all realise his conception of a body of freebooters or robbers they all seemed to wear the same uniform and to resemble each other in their accoutrements and characteristics they rather resembled in short a detachment of regular forces than a body of men whom chance might have thrown together or the fortune of predatory war | while he gazed upon them two of their number whose attire was rich and costly and who seemed to be of higher rank than the rest perhaps their officers attracted his attention as they walked near the spot where clinging to a tree he overlooked the encampment from above | one of them was a tall dark warrior whose whole demeanour was that of the professional soldier whose dress was plain yet rich and who might easily be guessed to be the commander of the party | he was talking earnestly but in a subdued tone to his younger companion whom he seemed to be labouring to convince of the propriety of some course of action | alfred watched them eagerly the form of the younger for so he appeared by his slender frame seemed familiar to him and when at last they turned their faces and walked towards him the light of a neighbouring fire showed him the face of his brother elfric |  my dream | he mentally exclaimed | they were evidently talking about some very important subject and it was also evident that the objections of the younger whatever they might be were becoming rapidly overruled when as chance if it were chance would have it they paused in their circuit of the little camp just beneath the tree where alfred was posted |  you see said the elder that our course is clear so definitely clear that we have but to do our duty to the king while we avenge a thousand little insults we have ourselves received from this insolent monk such insults as warriors wash out with blood |  yet he is a churchman and it would be called utter sacrilege | sacrilege  is a churchman's blood redder than that of layman and is he not doomed as a traitor by a judgment as righteous as ever english law pronounced | did he not keep edwy from his throne during the lifetime of the usurper edred |  that was the sentence of the witan and you served edred |  i did not owe the allegiance of an englishman to either being of foreign birth and so was no traitor as for the witan it is well known dunstan influenced their decision at the death of the royal edmund |  i never heard the assertion before |  you have many things still to learn you are but young as yet | but let it pass | does not his conduct to queen elgiva merit death |  i think it does | but still not without sentence of law |  that sentence has been in fact pronounced for in such cases as these where the subject is too powerful for the direct action of the law to reach him the decision of the king and council must pass for law and they have decided that dunstan must die and have left the execution of the sentence to us | he did not add that the council in question consisted of the giddy young nobles who had surrounded edwy from the first aided by a few hoary sinners whose lives of plunder and rapine had given them a personal hatred of the church | elfric heaved a sigh and said: if so i suppose i must obey but i wish i had not been sent on the expedition |  it is to test your loyalty |  then it shall be proved | i have no personal motives of gratitude towards dunstan |  rather the contrary |  rather the contrary as you say | but what sound was that | surely something stirred the bush |  a rabbit or a hare | you are becoming fanciful and timid | well you will remember that tomorrow there must be no timidity no yielding to what some would call conscience but wise men the scruples of superstition | we shall not reach the monastery till dark most of the visitors will then have quitted it and we shall take the old fox in a trap |  you will not slay him in cold blood | no  i shall bid him follow me to the king and if he and his resist as probably they will then their blood be on their own heads | but surely at that moment a large stone which alfred had most inopportunely dislodged rolled down the bank and made elfric who was in its path leap aside | alfred whose foot had rested upon it slipped and for a moment seemed in danger of following the stone but he had happily time to grasp the tree securely and by its aid he drew himself back and darted into the wood | luckily there was moonlight enough to guide him by the track he had hitherto followed and he ran forward dreading nothing so much as to fall into the hands of the friends of his brother and trusting that he might prevent the execution of the foul deed he had heard meditated | he ran for a long distance before he paused when he became aware that pursuers were on his track | luckily his life had been spent so much in the open air that he was capable of great exertion and could run well | so he resumed his course although he knew not where it would lead him and soon had the pleasure of feeling that he was distancing his pursuers | yet every time he ran over a piece of smooth turf he fancied he could hear them in his rear and it was with the greatest feeling of relief that he suddenly emerged from the wood upon the foss way and saw the lights of the hostelry at no great distance below him | his pursuers did not follow him farther probably unwilling to betray their presence to the neighbourhood and perhaps utterly unconscious that the intruder upon their peace was possessed of any dangerous secrets or other than some rustic woodman belated on his homeward way who would be unable in any degree to interfere with them or to guess their designs | but it was not till the ardour of his flight had abated that alfred could fully realise that his unhappy brother was committed to a deed of scandalous atrocity and the discovery was hard for him to bear | the strong impression which his dream had made upon him an impression that he was to be the means of saving his brother from some great sin came upon him now with greater force than ever and was of great comfort | the identity of the scenery he had seen in dreamland with the actual scenery he had gone through made him feel that he was under the special guidance of providence | returning to the inn he sought father cuthbert and found him somewhat uneasy at his long absence and to him he communicated all that he had seen and heard | the good father was a man of sound sense but of much affection and at first he could not credit that the boy he had loved so well elfric of aescendune should have grown to be the associate of murderers for such only could either he or alfred style the agents of edwy's wrath | but once fully convinced he was equal to the emergency |  we will not start at once we should but break down on the road and defeat our own object | we must rest quietly and sleep soundly if possible and start with the earliest dawn | we shall reach glastonbury by midday and be able to warn the holy abbot of his danger in good time | so alfred was forced to curb his impatience and to try to sleep soundly | father cuthbert soon gave good assurance that he was asleep but the noisy manner in which the assurance was given banished sleep from the eyelids of his anxious pupil | at length he yielded to weariness both of mind and body and the overwrought brain was still | he was but little refreshed when he heard father cuthbert's morning salutation benedicamus domino and could hardly stammer out the customary reply deo gratias | every one rose early in those days and the timely departure of the party from aescendune excited no special comment | hundreds of pilgrims were on the road and alfred expressed his conviction that there would be force enough at glastonbury to protect dunstan to which father cuthbert replied if he would accept such protection | on former days their journey had been frequently impeded by broken bridges and dangerous fords but as they drew near glastonbury the presence of a mighty civilising power became manifest | the fields were well tilled for the possessions for miles around the abbey were let to tenant farmers by the monks who had first reclaimed them from the wilderness | the farm houses and the abodes of the poor were better constructed and the streams were all bridged over while the old roman road was kept in tolerable repair | a short distance before they reached the city the pilgrims who were a space in advance of the party came in sight of the towers of the monastery whereupon they all paused for one moment and raised the solemn strain then but recently composed i founded on the rock of ages salem city of the blest built of living stones most precious vision of eternal rest angel hands in love attending thee in bridal robes invest |ii  down from god all new descending thee our joyful eyes behold like a bride adorned for spousals decked with radiant wealth untold all thy streets and walls are fashioned all are bright with purest gold |iii  gates of pearl for ever open welcome there the loved the lost ransomed by their saviour's merits this the price their freedom cost: city of eternal refuge haven of the tempest tost |iv  fierce the blow and firm the pressure which hath polished thus each stone: well the mastermind hath fitted to his chosen place each one | when the architect takes reck'ning he will count the work his own | v glory be to god the father glory to th' eternal son glory to the blessed spirit: one in three and three in one | glory honour might dominion while eternal ages run |amen   xx the grand strains seemed to bring assurance of divine aid to alfred and he could but imitate father cuthbert who lifted up his stentorian voice and thundered out in chorus as they drew near the pilgrims | here they left the foss way for the side road leading to the monastery now only a short distance from them | chapter xi | the flight of dunstan | it was the day of st alban the protomartyr of england and the saint was greatly honoured at glastonbury where as we have seen dunstan was in residence and as a natural consequence every department of the monastic life was quickened by his presence | the abbey was full of monks who had professed the benedictine rule and having but recently been rebuilt it possessed many improvements hardly yet introduced into english architecture in general | the greater part of the building was of stone and it was not in its general features unlike some of the older colleges at oxford or cambridge although the order of the architecture was of course exclusively that of the saxon period characterised by the heavy and massive yet imposing circular arch | but upon the church or abbey chapel all the skill of the architect had been concentrated and it seemed worthy alike of its founder and of its object | seen upon the morning in question when the bright summer sun filled every corner with gladsome light just as the long procession of white robed priests and monks in their sombre garb with their hoods thrown back were entering for high mass and the choral psalm arose it was peculiarly imposing | the procession had not long entered the church when the party of pilgrims we have described closely followed by our friends from aescendune entered the quadrangle and crossed it to the great porch of the church | it was with the greatest difficulty they could enter for the whole floor of the huge building was crowded with kneeling worshippers | the portion of scripture appointed for the epistle was being chanted and the words struck alfred's ears as he entered he pleased god and was beloved of him so that living among sinners he was translated | the words seemed to come upon him with special application to the danger the great abbot was in and the thought that the martyr's day might be stained by a deed of blood or as some might say hallowed by another martyrdom added to his agitation | and now he had gained a position where the high altar was in full view illuminated by its countless tapers and fragrant with aromatic odours | there in the centre of the altar his face turned to the people as the sequence was ended and the chanting of the gospel from the rood loft began stood the celebrant and alfred gazed for the first time upon the face of dunstan brought out in strong relief by the glare of the artificial light | he strove earnestly to concentrate his thoughts upon the sacred words | he could not but feel the strange coincidence that words such as these should come to strengthen him when he felt he had most need to shelter himself under the shadow of the cross | the service proceeded the creed sanctus and other choral portions being sung by the whole monastic body in sonorous strains and for a time alfred was able to make a virtue of necessity and to give himself wholly to the solemnity but when it was over and the procession left the church he sought an immediate interview with the abbot in company with father cuthbert | dunstan had removed his sacerdotal garments and had returned to his own cell which only differed in size from the cells of his brethren | the furniture was studiously plain: hard wooden chairs an unvarnished table a wooden bedstead with no bed and only a loose coverlet of sackcloth the walls uncovered by tapestry the floor unfurnished with rushes such was the chamber of the man who had ruled england and still exercised the most unbounded spiritual influence in the land | aw'd rayther be stranspoorted to botny bay nor be as aw am | ther's hardly a

feel reight daan shamed ov hissel an' set to wark to put things reight agean | nah zantippa wor just i' one o' these moods an' shoo made th' beds coom daan stairs an' weshed all th' pots scaled th' fire an' took the ass aght gave th' hearthstun another dooas o' idleback scattered a bit ov fresh sand o' th' floor an' after weshin' hersen an' donin' a clean print dress shoo laid th' table ready for th' teah gate th' kettle onto th' rib an' sat daan wi' her bag ful o' worset an' a heap o' stockins an' as shoo luk'd raand shoo felt as pleased as punch to see what a difference shoo'd been able ta mak in an haar or two |  aw'm nooan sooary 'at aw stopt at hooam shoo said to hersen |  aw know dick'll be suited when he sees all fettled up an' if aw get theas stockins done ta neet the'll be aght o'th gate | aw wonder ha it wor 'at he tuk things sooa quietly this nooin aw dooant think it's reight when a chap's been work in' iver sin six o'clock ov a mornin' for him to come hooam an' find noa dinner ready | reight enuff a woman's plenty to do to follow her haase an' cook an' mend but if ther wor noa wage comin' in ther'd be less cookin' an' moor mendin' aw've a noation | aw've made up mi mind woll aw've been sidin' up 'at aw'll nut waste mi time as aw have done talkin' an' gossippin' for ther's noa gooid comes on it an' altho' aw want to keep thick wi' mi neighbors aw'm determined aw'll chop that sooart o' thing off at once for my mother used to tell me 'if ther were noa listeners ther'd be noa taletellers ' an' th' time 'at one spends is war nor wasted for it oft leads ta 'fendin' an' provin' for them 'at come an' tell yo summat abaght somdy else will just as sooin tell somdy else summat abaght yo | an' luk what scrapes one gets into wi' it | nah aw made dick believe 'at th' chimley smookd that wor a lie to say th' least on it an' he'll be sure ta noatice 'at it doesn't smook ta neet but if he names it aw'll tell th' truth for aw'm sure noa gooid comes o' lying | when zantippa had just made this resolve th' door opened an' dick au' three childer coom in throo th' miln | he saw th' difference in a minnit |  wipe them clogs he said as th' childer wor walkin' in |  tha's been fettlin' a bit lass aw think | are ta baan to ax some o'th' neighbors to ther drinkin' | noa  shoo says aw'm baan to ax noabody but thee an' th' childer | does ta want me to ax somdy |  nay nooan soa | aw'd as gooid as promised to goa as far as 'th' cock' ta neet to talk ovver this bit ov a doo but aw think aw'll stop at hooam what says ta | zantippa smiled nay even blushed shoo knew what he ment an' shoo felt pleased | it wor a bit ov a compliment an' paid her for all her trouble |  please thisen shoo said as shoo poured aght a cup o' teah for him an' lifted a pile o' tooast aght o' th' oven but aw think th'rt as weel at hooam |  well an' aw think aw'm better he said as he luk'd raand aw think th' chimley doesn't smook as ill as it did does it | shoo hung her heead an' stooped ta pick a pin off th' floor but shoo couldn't find one an' when shoo luk'd up ther een met | shoo didn't spaik nor moor did he it worn't needed | it wor a long time sin they'd sich a comfortable teah an' when they'd done they sat some time at th' table i' silence | ha' long they might have sat aw connot tell hadn't th' door oppened an' betty come runnin' in wi' a pot to beg a sup o' hot watter for shoo said her chap had coom hooam an' shoo'd been rayther longer nor shoo expected an' he wor playin' th' varry hangment for his drinkin' | shoo gate her hot water an' went away | dick luk'd at his wife an' takkin' howd ov her hand said aw'm glad 'at tha hasn't to goa seekin' hot water an' aw hooap tha niver may have |  aw hooap nut shoo said an' sat daan evidently varry ill set ta see her stockins | nah what a little con make fowk happy or miserable | dick wor as content as a king becoss all th' haas wor tidy | he saw at somdy had been tryin' to mak' him comfortable an shoo wor as delighted as if shoo'd getten a fortin left becoss what shoo'd done had suited him | when th' childer had getten all put ta bed dick said lass aw've been thinkin' 'at aw dooant care soa mich abaght gooin to this teadrinkin' for aw've a noation 'at we connot goa ta th' tea withaat stoppin' an' spendin' a lot o' brass at after an' aw've heeard thee say as thar't fast for some flannel | nah if we stop at hooam an' spend th' brass o' what it is tha wants it'll do us moor gooid nor th' ale what says ta |  just thee please thisen dick | aw had thowt o' gooin but as tha says it's sure to cost summat an' awr billy wants some new clogs for yond tak watter varry ill an' aw dooant know what we could do better wi' th' brass an' aw think we con have as comfortable a teah at hooam |  aw'm sure an' moor soa an' as tha's decided nut to goa aw'll tell thi ov a marlock some o'th' chaps has been playin' but tha munnat split for it hasn't to get aght woll after th' pairty | tha knows hungary at works wi' us |  does ta meean him 'at once ait a pailful o' draff |  th' same chap | an' he declared 'at if he gate aside o'th steaks at this doo he'd polish th' lot an' aw believe he can ait owt less nor a bullock soa some o'th chaps made it up 'at he should have a dish to his own cheek but they'd ta be donkey steaks for owd labon 'at hawks cockles an' mussels had let his donkey catch cold or summat at ony rate it dee'd an' soa they thowt if they could get some steaks off that they'd just come in but they knew 'at owd labon had rayther part wi' his heead nor let onybody mell o'th donkey for he thowt as mich on it as if it wor a christian | but they determined to scheme some way to get it soa joe longfooit offered to go into th' yard where it wor an' cut off one hinder leg an' tak it hooam ta cook if sam sniggle 'ud watch aght to see 'at noabody coom | labon kept his donkey tha knows in a place at th' top o'th long stepses an' used ta goa raand th' back rooad wi' it soa one dinner time they'd watch'd labon aght o'th' yard where he'd been standin' rubbin' his een an' strokin' his owd favourite an' when he'd getten nicely off they ventured to try ther luck | joe longfooit went up wi' a gurt carvin' knife an' left sam at th' bottom to whistle if he saw onnybody comin' an' he stood thear for a while but he wanted a bit o' bacca an' ther wor sich a wind i'th' steps 'at he couldn't get a leet soa he went across the rooad into a doorhoil for shelter | he worn't aboon a minnit or two away but when he coom back what should he see but owd labon within a few steps o'th' top | he hardly knew what ta do but he managed as mich wind as made a whistle an' stood watchin' for th' next move | joa heeard the signal but it wor too lat for he couldn't get aght withaat th' owd chap seein' him an' he'd getten th' leg cut off ready for huggin' away soa seizin' hold o'th' shank he watched for owd labon's hat showin' aboon th' wall top when he gave it sich a clencher wi' th' thick end o'th' leg woll he forced th' brewards reight onto his sholder then he laup'd ovver th' wall an' ran hooam wi' his prize as fast as his legs could carry him leavin' laban to find his way into dayleet ageean as weel as he could | sam met him at th' haase an' they worn't long i' cutting some grand lukkin' steaks off an' puttin' 'em ov a dish i'th cubboard an' bith' time they'd done that th' bell rang an' they'd ta goa back ta ther wark | when labon gate his hat once more onto th' top ov his heead he went ta see his owd deead friend an' when he saw it ligged thear wi' nobbut three legs he vow'd vengeance agean them 'at had done it an' declared 'at if iver he fan it aght he'd mak 'em pay for it for it wor nowt noa less nor robbin' th' deead an' he'd have' em tried for assasination | joa's wife wor aght when they took th' leg hooam an' after they cut th' steaks off they'd hid t' other part under th' coils | but they hadn't been gooan soa varry long when shoo coom in an' as shoo wor gettin' th' pots aght o'th cubbord shoo saw this dish' ful o' steaks | a'a  shoo says it's just like yond chap to put thease in here an' say nowt abaght it but aw con just relish one o' thease to my drinkin' an' aw dar say he'll want one an' awm sure th' childer 'll do wi' a bit | we hav'nt had as mich fleshmait i' awr haase afoor for many a wick | fotch that gridiron polly | we'st ha to do it o'th' top o'th' coil for ther isn't fat enuff to fry it | shoo worn't long afoor shoo had it nicely cooked an' the tea made an' a thowt struck her' at shoo'd ax sam's wife to her tea for shoo knew 'at they didn't oft get steak at their haase so polly went an' browt mistress sniggle an' all th' childer to ther tea an' as ther wor eight on' em they varry sooin put thersen o'th' aghtside o'th' steak | they set to wark then to get some clean pots ready for joa an' sent one o'th' childer ta watch th' miln loise ta tell sam ta come wi' him | when they come all wor nicely ready for' em but ther minds worn't easy for ther'd been a policeman axing abaght 'em at ther wark for labon had seen sam at th' bottom o'th' steps an' he thowt he knew summat abaght it soa they declared they'd niver own to it to a wick soul | as sooin as they gate in they smell'd what wor up for joa knew ther wor noa mait i' th' haase else an' his wife had no brass to buy ony | he looked at sam an' thear they stooid i' th' middle o' th' floor as white as two ghosts staring at one another but they darn't spaik an' booath waited to see what t'other did |  come on to your drinkin' said th' women | a'a  tha'rt a grand un joa said his wife to put them steaks i' th' cubbord an' niver say a word abaght it an' tha knows ha fond aw am ov a bit o' steak an' it's a bit o' nice mait too tho' it isn't as tender as some | we've savvor'd it aw con tell thi for considerin' th' price o' mait nah a gooid steak's hardly within th' raich o' workin' fowk | joa wor dumb struck he stirred his tea but he couldn't tak his een off th' steak | sam rested his head on his hand an' complained abaght bein' poorly |  it's for want o' some gooid support mun said his wife get some o' that mait into thi | it's made me feel a different body awm as frisky as a young foil an' luk at th' childer they're wrastlin' thear like young bullocks | mun it puts a bit o'th' natur o'th' beast into 'em | but sam declared he felt poorly an' couldn't touch mait but joa couldn't spaik at all | as he sat starin' at th' dish old laban went past th' door wi' a basket o' awther arm shaatin' aght cockles alive | mussels alive oh | as sooin as joa heard that he seized a fork an' stuck it into th' mait wi' sich a force 'at he smashed th' dish an' pinned it fast to th' table top |  woa up | he said stop thee thear | a'a gaumless  tha's been having summat to sup this afternooin aw can see said his wife |  tha mud ha' thowt owd labon wor callin o'th' steak to goa wi' him | but poor joa couldn't get a word off | drops o' sweat stood ov his foreheead as big as pays an' he couldn't tak his een off th' mait |  is ther summat th' matter wi' that steak makes thi 'at tha connot touch it | said his wife awm sure it's nicely enuff what is ther to do wi' thi |  oh th' steak's reight enuff said joa raisin' courage to spaik th' steaks all reight but aw'm nut i'th' knife an' fork line to neet | what's that noise i'th' cellar | he said starting aght ov his chear wi' his hair ommost studden ov an end an' his een starin' an' his teeth girnin' like a sheepheead between a pair o' tangs |  what noise | does ta mean that rawtin' daan i'th' cellar | eea   oh it's nobbut th' childer 'at's laikin some on 'em's recknin' to be donkeys an' t'other's drivin' 'em they've been at it iver sin they'd ther drinkin' it's that mait 'at's suited 'em soa mun woll they dunnot know what to do |  aw mun goa hooam said sam aw can't bide aw'm varry poorly |  why yo booath luk awther poorly or summat said his wife |  an' aw think th' sooner yo get to bed an' th' better | sam an' his wife and childer went hooam an' it wornt long afoor joa wor burrying his heead under th' blankets an' tryin' to fall asleep but he couldn't for as sooin as he began to dooaz off he began dreamin' 'at he wor tryin 'to swallow a donkey an' wakkened wi' it stickin' in his throit | th' next mornin' when they met ther faces luk'd moor like two dazed cakes nor owt for they'd hardly a mite o' color left |  we're reight in for it this time sam said joa |  aw believe this job 'll tell ov itsel' | does ta think 'at it makes ony difference wi' fowk aiting donkey beef |  well aw dooant know but aw did once know a chap 'at wor a reglar cauf heead an' he hardly iver ait owt but veal an' tha knows th' bass singer at awr church gets bacon to ommost ivery meal an' he grunts as ill as a pig bi'th' heart does he an' awm sure my childer's ears luk'd longer to me this mornin' or else aw thowt soa |  well an aw'm sure my wife snoor'd i'th neet moor like a donkey rawtin nor owt else an' th' fust thing awr isaac axed me this marnin' wor to buy him some panniers so as he could be a mule | but what are we to do wi' yond t'other pairt o'th' leg |  oh we mun burry that we'll ha' noa moor truck wi' that an' aw think we'd better ax some advice abaght some o' them 'at's etten th' other for it wod be a doo if they'd to start o' growin' tails or summat | ther's noa tellin' | they were boath soa terrified woll they left their wark an' they went to see an owd chap 'at's varry skilful o' heearbs an' they tell'd him all abaght it an' axed him if he thowt it 'ud mak ony difference to them 'at had etten it |  well he said considerin' what sooart o' fathers they have aw dooant think it will mak mich difference to th' childer it hardly con an' if th' wives get rayther unruly yo mun try an' bridle 'em a bit | but if yo'll tak my advice for't future yo'll let that alooan 'at doesn't belang to yo for yo'll allus find ought dishonestly getten will breed moor trouble to yo nor what th' loss 'll mak to them yo've ta'en it throo soa goa hooam an' bear i' mind 'at honesty is th' best policy an' if 'owd labon's donkey has towt yo that lesson it hasn't dee'd for nowt | they went back to their wark but someha' or other it's getten wind an' aw fancy 'at th' doctor's tell'd but be that as it may aw consider they wor reight sarved an' aw dooant think they'll show up at this tea drinkin' |  well aw niver heard sich a tale i' my life said zantippa |  an' aw should think they'll never see a donkey withaght thinkin' on it an' if soa it'll noa daat be for th' best | noabody owt to be aboon learnin' when they've a chonce an' aw think aw've lent a lesson to day |  does ta lass an' what is it |  why 'at to mak hooam comfortable owt to be a woman's furst duty for a clean hearth an' a cheerful fire do a deal towards makin' a cheerful heart for when a haase is upset a chap's temper gets upset an' it's a deal better to prevent a few cross words nor to try an' mak things up agean |  tha'rt a gooid lass zantippa | god bless thi | let's goa to bed | one two three | nah number one is onybody an' iverybody for we're all number one to ussen | ther's an old sayin an' it must be true for ommost iverybody seems to believe it 'at we should all remember number one that is it's set daan to be iverybody's duty to do th' best they can for thersen an' it's becoss this doctrine is soa well acted up to 'at maks me think 'at ther may be a bit ov amusement an' profit i' studying abaat it at this time yo can tak th' amusement an' let me have th' profit | nah if you act up to my advice aw think yo may be happen better nor yo are an' if yo dooant aw dooant think yo'l be ony war an' that's one comfort | ther's nowt like startin at th' faandation ov a subject if yo want to deal wi' it in a reight way an' aw intend to goa to th' rooit an' as money is th' rooit ov all evil an' th' number one doctrine is i' my opinion an evil aw shall start wi' brass | we mun awther believe money to be th' rooit ov all evil or else we daat th' wisdom o' him at sed it but at th' same time my experience taiches me at it's a varry useful thing to have i' yor pocket when yo goa to market an' it's a wonderful thing for stiffenin a chap's back booan | allus remember this at th' heigher yo hold yor heead an' lower other fowk 'll bow theirs | ther are exceptions to this rule for ther are 'at think a honest man has as mich reight to hold up his heead even if he hasn't a penny in his pocket as one 'at's thaasands o' paands | ov coorse yo know better nor that for a empty heead an' a full purse can pass muster even i'th' parliament | then whativer yo do yo mun get hold o' this brass an' niver heed if becoss your gettin moor nor yo want causes some others to goa short that's nowt to yo yor number one an' luk to that | if yo can nobbut get a fortune yo'll find friends come withaat seekin | but mind whativer yo do to get yor brass honestly that is get it i' some way 'at th' law cannot touch yo | dooant knock a chap daan an' tak it throo him but start some sooart ov a society wi' a long name get some offices in a garret in a grand street get some chap wi' a hannel to his name to be president an' a lot o' directors 'at nawther yo nor onybody else iver knew pay a poor begger fourteen shillin a week to be scratchetary mak yorsen into th' treasurer an' then advertise | somdy'll be sure to tak shares an' as sooin as ther's ony brass to goa on wi ' vooat yor sen a salary ov two thaasand a year mak sure to get it an' then if ther's ony claims at yo connot meet wind up th' business | fowk'll be sure to sympathise wi' yo and yo'll have as mich as 'll keep yo respectable for a bit an' then yo can luk aght for another chonce o' turnin a honest penny | yor belly'll be full an' your back weel clooathed your conscience well tak noa noatice o' that an' if yo can get a front seeat in a chapel yo'll stand a gooid chonce o' been made a taan caancillor or a member o'th schooil booard | this number one doctrine has another advantage a chap 'at follows it aght has nubdy's else interests to bother abaat he doesn't care who dees soa long as he lives nor who sinks soa long as he can swim | but allus tak care net to let other fowk know 'at yo live up to this system for although iverybody thinks a gooid deeal o' ther own number one nubdy seems fond ov another's | some even goa soa far as to call a number one chap selfish | well worn't we born into th' world to be selfish | what have we nails for if we munnot scrat | what have we teeth for but to bite | what have we een for but to look after awr own interests | what have we ears for but to listen for iverything to us own advantage | what have we bodies for but to serve | this is number one doctrine | its varry popular an' does varry weel for this world ther's a deal o' hansom gravestooans stand ovver once successful number ones | what ther number is i'th' next world is moor nor aw can tell but aw know they'll have to start afresh for all they iver gained they've left behund | fowk 'at niver loise seet o' 'number one ' are a hard workin set as a rule but even they have to amuse thersen a bit sometimes an' they find it a nice change to luk after 'number two '| to a chap o' this sooart iverybody's 'number two ' 'at's a bit better awther i' luks position or pocket | nah if yo want ony fun o' this sooart aw'll tell yo ha to get it | furst ov all find aght sombdy 'at yo fancy yore mates think moor on nor they think o' yo watch him ivery time yo get a chonce an' see if yo connot pick aght a hoil in his coit | dooant be disheartened if yo have to luk a long time before yo can find a fault be sure ther is one somewhear an' if yo can't see it at a distance hutch cloiser up mak a gurt fuss on him niver say owt contrary to what he says if he says summat funny laff fit to split yor sides an' if he says owt serious luk solemn an' shak yor heead | watch him carefully an' it's a thaasand to one but some day yo'll catch him trippin | if when yo've fun a hoil it's soa little as to be hardly worth noaticing dooant despair wol yor clappin him on his back an' smilin in his face yo can happen get yor finger in an then rive it a bit bigger | do it gently at furst just a little bit at a time and then when yo've getten a chonce rip it as far as yo can | but be sure yo have nowt ony moor to do with him after that | if yo see him comin cross on t'other side o' th' rooad niver let on 'at yo've seen him but as sooin as he's getten past shak yor heead sorrowfully an' sigh if yo happen to have a clean hankerchy i' yor pocket yo may tak it aght and mak believe to wipe off a tear niver heed if ther isn't one fowk'll think better o' yo an' all the war o' him | if onybody should come an' ask yo if yo've heeard that sad tale abaat him say | 'god forbid at yo should hear owt war nor what yo've heeard before '| dooant seem inclined to listen but when they've done say 'well well it's a thaasand pities but if that wor th' warst it wodn't matter mich '| he's sure to go away wi' th' noation 'at yo know summot abaat th' same chap 'at's ten times war nor owt he's heeard but yo've too mich gooid natur to tell it | nah this is all varry gooid fun for' number one ' an when yo see poor' number two' loise his shop or shunned or luked shyly at wi' them at wor once his admirers an' yo know 'at it's allowing to yo then yo can goa hooam an' shut yorsen up all bi yorsen an' laff an rejoice to yor heart's content | but dooant be surprised if when yo chuckle yo should hear another chuckle cloise to yor elbow for haiver yo lock an' bolt th' door yo connot keep th' devil aght | he enjoys a bit o' fun o' this sooart as weel as yo an' he's nobbut come to show yo ha pleased he is | if yo dooant like his compny sarve him th' same way remember yo're 'number one ' an he's nobbut 'number two' to yo | pool as long a face an' luk as sanctimonious as yo can an' wheniver yo've a chonce tell fowk to shun him an' all his works tell 'em 'at he's prowlin raand like a lion seekin who to make a meal on th' next | yo needn't be mailly maathed abaat him becoss he's net suppooased to have ony friends | he willn't care a button what yo say 'coss he knows yo cannot injure his character an' he laffs to hissen as he sees yo sighin an lyin an scheamin all for 'number one ' an he puts a mark opposite yor name to show 'at he's noa need to luk after yo ony moor yo're all safe an' then he turns his attention to some 'number twos '| it's gooid spooart isn't it | may be yo think it's a spooart 'at's niver entered onybody's heead but mine but yor mistakken | it's a varry common spoart | mind yo dooant catch yorsen indulging in it some day | number three reminds a body ov a deeal o' things but nowt as mitch as a pop shop | them three gold balls 'at hing aght to show whear th' poor fowk's bankers live if they could nobbot spaik could tell a tale 'at wod cap some o' them wiseacres 'at reckon to know all poor fowk's troubles an' th' way to cure' em | nah it's a puzzle to me to accaant for one o' these things an' that is 'at fowk's actions should be regarded through a different standpoint to owt else i' th' world | a little tree is a tree an' it's nobbut a tree ha big it is a puttate is nobbut a puttate if it grows as big as a churn an' a man considers hissen a man whether he's a goliah or a tom thumb | but actions are different altogether | whether they're to be considered gooid or bad depends entirely o' th' bugth on 'em | a chap 'at can chait somdy aght ov twenty thaasand paands is considered smart: but a poor begger 'at stails a looaf is a thief | a chap 'at walks into th' joint stock bank an' | leaves th' title deeds ov his property for th' loan ov five or six hundred paands is an honerable tradesman 'an it's considered a business like act but a poor woman' at taks her fiat iron to th' pop shop an' borrows sixpence on it commits a sin it's a disgrace | aw wonder what th' mooast o' th' banks are but pop shops | what difference is ther between a pop ticket an' a check book | varry little nobbut th' bugth | i' my opinion it's noa moor a disgrace for a chap to pop a paper coller nor for another to morgage a property | ther's a gooid deal o' speculation sometimes i' booath cases | nah aw once knew a chap at popt a haufacraan for two an four pence an then sell'd th' ticket for a shillin: soa he didn't loise owt | they're useful places i' ther way though aw dooant mean to say at ther's noa evils connected wi' 'em | nah aw once knew a woman 'at popt her husband's sunday clooas so as shoo could buy a new dress for hersen 'an when he fan it aght he gave her a lickin an' had to goa befoor th' magistrates an' they fined him ten shillin or to goa to quad for a month soa his wife popt her dress to' pay th' fine | nah it isn't ivery evil 'at can reighten itsen like that an' varry likely bith time they've getten 'em aght agean they'll have lernt moor wit | ther's summat else 'at number three reminds me on an' that's th' three things at we all owt to have faith hope an' charity | as to faith ther's awther a gooid deeal on it i' th' world or else fowk dooant spaik truth | hope we've all enuff on an' some fowk moor nor what does' em ony gooid for they're ofter hopin nor strivin | but when it comes to charity then aw'm a sooart o' fast amang it | it's a nice word a bonny word aw think it luks nice in a church or a bazaar | it's a nice word to tak for a text it saands nice onytime unless it's at a meetin o' th' poor law guardians then it saands harder an' harsher someway | for mi own part aw've niver been able to understand exactly what it meeans | i have an opinion o' mi own but then aw know it must be wrong becoss it's so different to other fowk's | aw wor once walkin aght wi' a chap 'at wor chock full o' charity | he wor soa full on it 'at it used to roll aght ov his maath ivery two or three minutes and we hadn't gone far when we met a little lad wi' hardly a bit o' clooas on him an' he luk'd as if he'd been livin o' th' smell ov a cook shop for a wick an' he coom beggin a hawpney | well to tell th' truth aw wor gooin to pass him for aw hadn't a fardin but my charitable friend did stop an' he patted him on his heead and axed if he he'd a father an' mother an' if he went to th' sunday schooil an if he knew his catichism an' then he sed well be a good boy an' sometime when aw've a hawpny aw'l give it thi ' an' we went away | when we'd gooan a two or three yards he sed 'let's have a glass o' ale for aw'm dry aw feel sooary for yond lad but yo connot allus be givin | sammy bewitched | aw shall niver forget sammy sawney | he's deead nah an' it's a pity at owt like him iver should dee for he wor net only t' first but aw believe t'last o' 'tsooart | aw niver remember him as a lad for he wor a gooid age when aw wor born but aw've heeard enuff abaat him to mak me feel as if aw'd known him at that time an' judgin' bi what aw knew on him as an old man aw can believe it ivery word true | sammy's mother wor a widdy an' he wor her only child | shoo wor worth a little bit o' brass an' his fayther had been considered varry weel to do for he'd abaat twenty hand loom weyvers workin for him an' his bumbazines wor allus considered t'best i' t'market | when sammy wor four year old shoo detarmined to send him to t'schooil an' have him eddicated for a banker's clerk for to be handlin brass all t'day long wor to her t'happiest condition i' life | it wor easy enough to send sammy to t'schooil but to get him eddicated wor another matter an' whether it wor as t'schooil maister sed 'at his heead wor too thick iver to drive owt into it or as his mother said 'at t'schooilmaister knew nowt an' soa he could taich nowt aw dooant pretend to say | little sammy hadn't a varry easy time on it for he wor shifted abaat throo one schooil to another wol he hadn't mich o' a chonce o' leearnin' even if he had some brains an' ther' wor at sed he hadn't | but his mother had faith ther wor summat in him an' varry likely ther wor for nowt iver coom aght an' what some fowk called wrangheeadedness shoo considered to be genius badly directed | one day he wor at t'beckside an' shoo went to see what he wor dooin' an' as shoo saw he'd nobbut one clog shoo axed him what he'd done wi' tother an' he sed he'd made it into a booat an' it had sailed away down t'beck soa shoo tawked nicely an' tell'd him he shouldn't do soa for it wor lost an' he mud allus remember 'at if he put owt into t'beck he'd niver see it ony moor for t'watter ran daan at sich a rate but he sed he'd fun aght a better way o' dooin' it next time for he'd put t'furst in wi' t'toa pointin daan t'hill but when he put t'next in he'd point t'toa up t'hill an' it wouldn't find it quite soa easy gooin |  a'a sammy lad sed his mother as shoo stroked his heead tha's a deal moor i' this nop nor ivver thi fayther had or me awther for aw should niver ha' thowt o' that | sammy put tother in takkin care to point t'toe t'contrary way to what t'watter wor runnin but as sooin as he left lawse it turned raand an' foller'd tother an' wor sooin aght o' seet |  nah then | he sed didn't aw tell yo | if it hadn't turned raand it 'ud ha' been goin' up t'hill but t'chap 'at made them clogs didn't mak' 'em reights an' lefts | yo see they're booath left an' aw believe that's the reason aw've allus been lat to t'schooil |  niver heed sammy tha shalln't go to t'school ony moor for aw believe tha'rt better able to taich t'maisters nor they are to taich thee |  awm sewer on it mother for t'last maister aw had sed awd towt him patience an' awm sartin he niver towt me owt |  come thi ways lad an' awl buy thee some new clogs at another shop but dooant put any moor into that beck unless tha tees a string to 'em if tha does awst ha' to give thee a lickin soa tha knows for even knowledge can be bowt too dear | after gettin his new clogs shoo tuk him into a spice shop to buy a penorth o' owt he liked soa he ax'd t'old woman for a penorth o' humbugs but as sooin as he'd getten 'em he altered his mind an' thowt he'd have acid drops soa shoo changed em' but he'd hardly getten 'em when he changed his mind an' said he'd rayther have a rockstick an' when he'd gate that he wor walkin' aght an' shoo sang aght after him 'at he'd niver paid her for it |  why aw gave yo t'acid drops for it |  eea but tha niver paid for t'acid drops |  a'a what a tale i didn't aw give yo t'humbugs |  but tha niver paid for t'humbugs |  why aw havn't etten t'humbugs have aw | didn't aw give' em yo agean | yo dooant want payin' twice sewerlee |  well aw dooant know hah it is what tha says saands reight enuff but what aw do know is at tha's getten a rockstick an' aw havn't getten a penny |  you see what it is to be a scholar sed his mother but yo'st loise nowt bi a child o' mine soa shoo gave her t'penny an' coom away | as they wor walkin on sammy put t'last bit into his maath an' sed mother can yo tell me why is old sally like that rockstick |  nay lad awm sewer aw cannot |  becoss they've booath getten suckt |  a'a lad dooant study soa mich awm feeard strainin thi brain but can ta spell brain | brane   nay lad ther's a i in it |  then aw must have three if aw've two i' mi heead an' one i' mi brain |  aw niver thowt o' that but tha'rt far too clivver for me an' awst nivver rest until aw get thi into a bank | now it soa happened 'at ther wor a man 'at had done business wi' sammy's fayther i' former days an' after a bit o' persuadin he consented to tak' him into his office an' t'lad wor soa praad ov his place 'at strange as it seems he did begin to leearn a bit o' summate t'chap tuk a deeal o' pains wi him an' his mother's heart wor oft made glad wi' hearin a gooid accaant of his gooins on | when he used to goa to his dinner wi' a pen stuck behind his ear an' his finger daubed wi' ink as if he'd been cleeanin' aght t'ink bottles shoo could hardly keep her arms off his neck an' monny a time shoo'd sit watchin him as he put t'puddin aght o' t'seet wi' tears in her een an' wish his farther wor thear to see him | but his face grew whiter an' he didn't seem to have as mich life in him as he used to have an' this caused her a deeal ov uneasiness an' at last shoo decided to goa an' have a word wi' his maister | shoo went to t'office an' they made a gurt fuss o' t'old woman an' ax'd her into a private raam to sit daan |  aw've come shoo sed to have a word or two abaat ahr sammy aw should like to know hah yo think he gets on |  better than we expected he said he runs errands very well and his writing is better than it was but his spelling wants improving yet we think we shall be able to make a man of him |  well if that's all aw think he'll get better on it an' as for spellin a word wrang nah an' then aw dooant see 'at that maks mich difference soa long as yo know what it meeans | but what do yo think troubles him t'mooast |  well at the present time it's with the which's but you must excuse me just now for a very important customer has called and i must see him | soa he jumpt up an' left her | it didn't tak her long to get hooam an' as shoo'd allus been ov a superstitious way o' thinkin her mind wor filled wi' anxiety abaat her lad |  just to think shoo sed as shoo trudged along 'at he should be bewitched | a grand lad like him but it's somdy at's done it just aght o' spite an' aw've a varry gooid noation who's done it | it's that nasty gooid for nowt 'at lives at t'back o' awr haase shoo's niver been able to bide t'seet on him sin' he cut her cat tail off an' shoo knew well enuff he nobbut did it for fun | but awl see if aw connot braik t'spell | as shoo had to pass a smithy on her way hooam shoo went in an' axed if they'd an old horseshoe to give her for shoo knew that wor a thing 'at witches couldn't bide t'seet on |  why meary what dun yo want it for | are yo freetened o' t'boggards |  awst nooan be freetened o' thee if tha wor a boggard shoo sed but has ta getten one |  well aw dooant know but aw've a pair o' donkey shooin here if tha thinks they'll fit yor sammy tha can have' em an' welcome |  aw think they'd be a deeal moor likely to fit thee judgin bi t'length o' thi ears shoo sed but aw want a horseshoe if tha's getten one an' if tha hasn't say soa an' dooant keep me waitin here | he hunted abaat till he rooited one aght an' he gave it her an' shoo put it in her pocket an' went off withaat iver stoppin to thank him for it | when sammy had getten his supper shoo sent him to bed an' tell'd him to leave her his waistcoit as shoo wanted to do summat at it | as sooin as shoo wor bi hersen shoo pool'd t'horseshoe aght ov her pocket an' began to plan hah shoo could fasten it to t'back ov his waistcoit for shoo thowt that wod be t'best place for it an' although it wor a nasty thing to hug up an daan yet it wor a deeal better nor havin to live under t'influence ov a evil eye | it tuk her a bit o' seheamin befoor shoo gate it stitched on to her fancy but patience won t'battle an' when shoo went to bed she felt easier in her mind | t'next mornin shoo'd a deal o' trouble to get sammy to put it on for he couldn't tell t'meanin on it but his mother lukt soa serious abaat it 'at he didn't like to say he wodn't wear it | he went to his wark but his jacket didn't fit quite as well as usual an' as for keep in his waistcoat i' ony bit like shape he couldn't do it for t'weight behind wor soa heavy wol it pool'd t'buttons ommost up to his chin an' when he sat on his stooil i' t'front o' t'desk he felt as if somdy wor tryin' to upset him backards | when he went to his dinner he felt as if he wor huggin a pack an' he begged hard ov his mother to let him goa withaat it but shoo sed shoo darn't trust him aght ov her seet if he hadn't it on for it wor to shield him |  it's a queer place for a shield he sed but awl try it this afternooin an' if it doesn't feel easier awst niver put it on agean | when he coom hooam at neet he wor booath tired an' cross an' after his supper he gat a slate an' pencil an' sat daan to write lukkin' varry glum | his mother watched him varry anxiously for a while an' then shoo sed quietly tha doesn't look varry weel to neet sammy does ta think tha'rt goin' to have a spell o' sickness |  noa but awm sick o' spellin' for t'gaffer's allus agate on me becoss aw connot spell

hasn't been hatched yet | it taks all sooarts to mak a world an aw suppooas if they wornt ratcatchers ther'd be summat short | sam sniffle wor a karacter in his way he seemed to have a bit ov a smatterin' o' iverything but what he professed to know th' mooast abaat wor dogs an rats | noa daat he had a bit o' knowledge but what wor far more sarviceable to him nor owt else wor a simple luk 'at he could put on an' a bit ov a lisp 'at he had made him seem soa harmless an simple 'at yo wodn't believe it possible for him to do owt wrang | he worn't varry big but he wor varry wiry an as full o' pluck as a gamcock | aw remember one neet as he wor gooin hooam net becoss he thowt it wor time but becoss his brass wor done he happened to hear a bobby comin' as he turned th' street corner | it wor varry dark soa he just stept back an waited for him comin' an as sooin as his heead popt past th' corner he gave him what he called a cauf knock an sent him sprawlin' his whoal length ith middle oth rooad | he wor hardly daan befoor sam ran to help him up | a'a  whativver's to do mister poleeceman | he sed |  are yo hurt | do tell me an he helpt him up an began to wipe th' muck off his clooas wi' his pocket hankerchy | th' poleeceman turned his bull's eye onto his face but nubdy could suspect sam |  did ta see it done | he axd |  eea aw saw it as fair as could be | it's a burnin' shame 'at

awm mich obleeged to yo an aw wish yo gooid neet an hooap yo'll meet wi noa moor misfortunes |  aw hooap net an' if they wor all like thee th' poleece ud have a easy time on it |  why maister if they wor all like me ther wodn't be onny poleece for aw havn't a heart i' mi belly big enuff for sich a job | sam left him an th' furst public haase he coome to he went in an had a rare spree wi' th' shillin' but when he coom aght if onnybody'd met him they'd ha been just as likely to think he'd been to a teetotal meetin' an' signed th' pledge | but if yo'd wanted to see him when he put on his varry simple smile yo should ha seen him when a lady browt him a pet dog 'at wor poorly | he wor noated far an wide as a dog doctor an ladies used to come throo all pairts wi ther pet's to ax sam's advice | hahivver ugly a little brute chonced to be brawt sam had his nomony ready |  a'a that is a little beauty mum aw havn't seen one like that mum aw can't say when mum | aw dooant think yo'd like to pairt wi' it mum |  oh no | i would not part with it for its weight in gold i it's such a faithful little dear |  awm sewer on it mum yo can see it in it | it's the varry picture o' faithfulishness | if yo leeav it wi' me it'll be weel takken care on mum | an what name might yo call it mum |  we call it lion |  that's just th' name for a little pet like this it is fer sewer |  what do you think is the matter with the little darling | then sam ud tak it in his hands an after strokin' it an smellin' at its breath he'd give it a nip 'at ud mak it yelp aght ten thaasand murders then he'd shake his heead an say aw thowt what wor th' matter as sooin as aw saw it mum yo see it's soa varry tender it can hardly bide touchin' | it's sufferin wi' enflimashun ov its liver | it's a strange thing but it's a disease 'at's gooin abaat amang dogs just at present | ther's monny a scoor dee ivvery wick for yo see ther's net monny 'at know hah to doctor 'em for it | it's a pratty little thing | it'll have to have some castor hoil an a paather mum | aw think aw can cure it in a wick mum |  well then i must leave it with you and be sure to treat the little thing kindly | kindly  why mum awd give it th' bit aght o' mi maath | it owt to have some warm milk an a paather th' furst thing but aw dooant happen to have onny ith haase an my lad willn't be hooam befoor dark an it's been awr rent day to day but as sooin: as ivver he comes wi his wage awl get it some tho' it's a pity poor thing 'at it connot have it nah but yo see aw didn't know 'at it wor comin' | after this speech he wor sewer to get a shillin' an sometimes hauf a craan an as he nivver reckoned owt off his doctor's bill he called that extra bunce | as sooin as shoo'd getten nicely aght oth gate he'd give it a claat oth side oth heead to let it know at th' beginnin' what it might expect if it didn't behave an then he'd tak it into th' cellar an tee some band raand it neck an festen it to th' wall an throw it a bit o' strea to lig on an after chuckin' it a crust o' breead an' givin' it some watter he'd leeav it tellin' it 'at as sooin as it had browt its stummack daan to that it ud noa daat feel better | it ud be pratty sewer to freat a bit but sam ud tak noa noatice wol th' next day an when he went to luk at it if he fan th' breead an waiter untouched he'd leeav it agean | abaht th' third day he says they generally begin to nibble a bit an as sooin as he saw that he used to give 'em a bit o' sop or summat but he took gooid care net to give 'em too mich | bi th' end oth wick they wor cured an' he used to wesh 'em an cooam 'em an tee a bit a blue ribbon raand ther neck an' tak 'em hooam an' when ther mistresses saw 'em jumpin' an' caperin' abaat an ommost fit to ait th' fire iron's they paid him what he charged withaat a word an gave him credit for being th' best dog doctor ith country | he made a gooid deal o' brass i' that way but that didn't pay him as weel as ratcatchin' | ther wor nivver onnybody could equal sam at catch in' a rat for he wor nivver known to fail | at all th' big haases ith district he wor as weel known | as th' pooastman | he's gien up th' trade nah or else aw wodn't let yo into th' saycret | this is th' way he used to do | th' cooachman or th' buttler throo some hall wod come to tell sam 'at he wor wanted as sooin as ivver he could spare time to goa up to th' hall to catch a rat 'at one oth sarvents had seen ith pantry for they wor all soa freetened 'at they darn't goa in | sam wod promise to be up directly an he'd put a net into his coit pocket an a two o three breead crumbs in a bit o' paper an a rat ommost as big as a kittlin but withaat a tooith in its heead into his inside brast pocket an then he'd set off | when he gate thear all th' sarvent lasses ud cluther raand him an tell him whear th' rat had been seen an all particulars |  well they're a nasty thing to have abaat a haase an a varry dangerous thing but awl do mi best to catch it if yo'll give me a sup o' ale if yo have it an if net pooarter'll do | aw want it to mix up summat to tice it aght | they seldom browt less nor a quairt an after takkin abaat a thimbleful to mix up his breead crumbs he swallow'd t'other for fear on it bein wasted | then he'd tak a cannel an goa to whear th' rat had been last seen an all th' lasses followin at a distance | after puttin his bait on th' floor an th' cannel ith far corner he'd begin chirpin an huntin under th' barrels an all abaat to see if ther wor a rat but as he seldom fan one when he thowt he'd carried it on long enuff he'd set up a gurt shaat it's here | it's here | an pawse th' cannel ovver with his fooit an as they couldn't tell where it might be they all flew off skrikin leavin' sam to quietly pool his owd forrester as he called him aght ov his pocket an lap it up ith net an come aght holdin' it at arms' length | then away went th' haasekeeper to tell th' mistress an th' mistress to tell th' maister an in a varry few minits ivverybody abaat th' place wor ith kitchen standin in a ring wi sam an th' rat ith middle | sam wor a hero just then but to luk at his face yo'd fancy he hadn't sense enuff to know it | ov coorse ther wor nowt to gooid for sam after that an he'd allus as mich to ait an drink as he could tuck into him an a hauf a craan beside | aw dooant know hah monny times he catched that rat but aw do know 'at he catched it three times i' one haase an he tell'd me he made as mich brass on it as monnya chap could mak wi a horse an cart | he'd a deeal more queer tricks but as he gate older he gave it up for he said it wor all vanity an as he wanted to settle daan an leead a quiet life he tuk a beershop an nah he amuses hiss en an his customers wi sittin' at th' end oth langsettle an tellin' his experience an if one hawf o' what he says is true when he dees he owt to be put under a glass shade an stuck ith halifax museum | owd moorcock | it's monny a long year sin what awm gooin to tell tuk place but aw remember it as weel as if it wor yesterday | he wor a queer sooart ov a chap wor owd drake an although some laft at him an considered him an oddity ther wor a gooid deeal moor 'at believed him to be a born genius | he wor a cobbler bi trade an a varry gooid cobbler too tho' he'd nivver sarved his time to it an altho' he'd had two or three gooid chonces o' startin' business ith' taan yet he allus shook his heead an sed he'd rayther goa on as he wor a bit longer | th' fact wor he loved his liberty an he'd getten a noashun 'at if he left his little hooam i' th' country he'd leeav his freedom wi it | an it's hardly to be wondered at for his snug cot lukt th' pictur' o' comfort | it wor a one stooary buildin' wi a straw thack an all th' walls wor covered wi honeysuckle an' jessamine an th' windows could hardly be seen for th' green leaves 'at hung as a veil i' th' front on 'em | stooan crop an haaseleek had takken up a hooam i' th' gutter an th' chimley wor ommost hid wi ivy | it wor a queer shaped place altogether all nucks an corners but it wor just what suited david | they called him david drake tho' he wor known best as owd moorcock | i' th' front wor a nice bit o' garden allus kept trim an seldom withaat a show o' bloom o' one sooart or another an away to one side wor what he called his farm a bit o' land abaat ten yards wide an twenty long whear he grew his cabbages an puttates an sich like an all araand for miles wor moorland covered wi heather an stockt wi game except at th' back ov his cot whear a bluff lukkin hill sprang ommost straight up makkin' a stranger feel afeeard lest it should tak a fancy to topple over an' bury booath th' cot an all in it | but if th' aghtside wor curious th' inside wor a deal moor soa an it wornt to be wondered at if a gooid monny fowk paid david a visit when they'd hauf a day to spare | he'd a wife geniuses generally manage to get a wife if they get nowt else an it isn't allus 'at they mak th' wisest choice but david mud ha done war for dolly o' dick's o' th' dike as shoo wor called wor as queer a customer as her husband an if we're to believe what shoo says if it hadn't ha been for her dave wod ha been a poor lost craytur | shoo didn't appreciate his genius that's true but wives as a rule niver do but shoo let him have his own way an sometimes when her wark wor done shoo'd even help him wi some of his fooilery | aw'd heeard a gooid deal abaat 'em soa one day aw detarmined aw'd pay 'em a visit soa after gettin' off at th' copley station aw started to climb a rough steep loin moor like th' bed of a beck nor owt else but trees o' awther side hung over wol they met at th' top an made a cooil shade 'at wor varry welcome for aw wor ommost sweltered | after a long scramel aw fan misen o norland moor an it wor a seet worth tewing for for th' heather wor i' bloom an it lukt as if a purple carpet had been laid for th' buzzards an bees to frolic on an ther wor sich a hum raand wol it saanded as if they wor playin' bass to th' skylarks 'at wor warblin' up aboon | aw struck aght in as straight a line as aw could for david's an havin come to th' garden gate aw stopt a minnit to admire th' flaars 'at covered th' graand an th' walls an even stretched far onto th' thack | aw hadn't stood long when a voice claise to my ear sed might yo be lukkin' for somdy |  are yo mistress drake | aw axed |  eea aw believe aw am but what might yo be wantin' | if yo've owt to sell yo've comed to th' wrang shop for brass is varry scarce here |  aw've nobbut comed to see yor maister aw sed is he in |  nay he isn't an aw dooant know whear yo'll find him for aw've niver met him yet but if it's awr dave yo meean he's inside soa yo can walk forrad an if it's onny shoes yo want mendin' aw can see to that as weel as him for he's reckonin' to be thrang this afternoon |  aw've nobbut come to have a bit o' tawk aw sed |  oh if that's all yo can come in there's a deeal moor fowk come to tawk to him nor what brings him any wark but it's happen as weel for if it worn't for me bein' allus naggin' at him he'd nivver get done th' bit he does an as it is he's hammerin' away when he owt to be i' bed an' keepin' ivverybody else wakken but aw've tried to taich him sense wol aw'm fair stall'd soa he mun goa his own gate an tak th' consequences | come yor ways we's find him i' th' far raam makkin marks an' spoilin' cleean paper | we went up a narrow passage an as th' door wor oppen aw'd a gooid luk at david an his raam befoor he saw me | it wor a varry little place wi a varry little winder an hardly heigh enuff for a chap to stand up in and all th' walls wor covered wi picturs an he wor set cloise to th' winder hard at wark at another | he wor a short fat gooid tempered lukkin chap wi a bald heead an just a bit o' white hair hingin' daan like a fringe all raand an his cheeks wor as red as a ripe apple an his hands brooad an braan show'd they'd had to face booath wark an weather | as dolly went in he lukt up an saw me |  come in he sed come in do it's varry whut sit yo daan | whativer browt ye up here to day | why yo'll be ommost melted | can yo sup some buttermilk | an he filled a glass 'at stood o' th' table an handed it to me | aw swollered it an then aw sed aw thowt as aw'd a bit o' spare time awd just come up an mak yor acquaintance for awve heeard a gooid deeal abaat yo an happen yo'll nooan think onny war o' me for comin' bi misel' |  tha's done reight to come lad aw'm allus glad to see anybody pop in | aw wor just thrang makkin marks as awr dolly calls it but as awd nivver onybody to taich me awm feeared aw havn't getten th' reight way o' gooin abaat it yet | yo see all theeas picturs | well yo'll not think mich on 'em but sich as they are they please me an they niver ait owt |  an what are ta shappin at nah | sed dolly |  this is to be th' erupshun o' maant vesuvius |  why what is it eruptin' for | sed dolly |  aw guess it's like thee it's nowt better to do | is that th' reason tha's put so mich brimston' colour abaat it | ther's nowt better nor brimston' an traitle for curin' erupshuns |  dolly aw've tell'd thee for aboon twenty year 'at tha's noa taste nobbut for summut to ait an yond lad tak's after thee | aw'd allus a fancy for my lad to be an artist he sed turnin' to me but he seems to care moor abaat hawkin' bits o' garden stuff but then we am't all born alike an aw made up mi mind nivver to try to foorce him to owt 'at he'd noa hankerin' after for if aw'd had two trades to pick aght on an one on 'em had been cobblin awst ha takken t'other whativver it had been but aw could ha liked mi lad to ha been summut better for aw gave him a gooid name when he wor kursened but yo cannot order theeas things as yo wod |  noa an it's a gooid job yo cannot for aw've quite enuff to put up wi to have thee messin' abaat as tha does but aw know varry weel that lad wod ha been a painter if tha'd had patience to taich him | but whear's that pictur' he did paint | tha'rt fond enuff o' shewin' thi own wark let's luk at somdy's else |  he nivver tried his hand but once an it wor this he sed as he' pooled one aght o' th' corner an when he showed it me aw'd to luk at it for a long time befoor aw could tell what to mak on it but at last aw decided it wor a camel but he wor soa mad 'at he sed he'd nivver paint another so long as he lived for it wor a drake | soa to prevent onybody else makkin sich another mistak aw've written on th' bottom' this is a drake |  tha can say what tha likes david but hawf a bad en an if yo can nobbut catch leets aw'm sewer ther's monny a thing less like a drake nor that | dooant yo think soa | shoo sed turnin' to me | aw sed aw thowt soa too: an then david axed me to goa into his study for yo mun know he sed aw've a study an a studio an a museum an a wild beast show i this haase as little as it is | he led the way into another raam abaat as big as that we'd left an showed me a row o' shelves filled wi books an a little table covered wi papers an aw tell'd him aw thowt he wor quite a literary sooart ov a chap |  why he sed aw've allus been fond o' readin' sin aw wor a bit ov a lad an sometimes aw string a line or two together 'at jingles varry nicely an two or three times aw've had some printed i'th' papers | mun it's varry nice to be able to sit daan an eease yor mind wi writin' a bit even if nubdy reads it | that lad o' mine cares nowt abaat it aw wish he did for aw believe if he'd takken to study he'd ha been a wonder for he's a rare heead it tak's a hat ommost as big as a coil skep to fit it | aw gate him to try one time an he wor a whole day i' gettin' theeas four lines aw allus keep 'em by me for aw know he'll nivver write ony moor |  : 'aw once wor lost on norland moor an' if aw'd ne'er been fun mooast likely aw'st a been thear yet an nah mi tale is done '|  tha'rt varry fond o' runnin daan them 'at belangs to thee sed dolly an to hear thee tawk fowk ud think he could nivver do owt reight but if that isn't poetry aw should like to know what is for awm sewer ther's a deeal more common sense in it nor ther is i' lots o' thine | but thear he is gooin past th' winder an he knows ther isn't a drop o' watter i' th' haase an aw can't bide to fotch ony | if he's like his fayther i' nowt else he is i' leavin' ivverything for me to do but aw'll let him see different | an throwing th' winder oppen shoo yell'd aght rubensrembrandtvandyke drake | tha'll come in this minit or else aw'll warm thee | an away shoo flew aght |  whativver made yo call him sich a name as that | aw axed |  why aw'd a fancy he'd be a cliver chap if he lived an soa aw gave him a cliver name but if aw had it to do nah aw think summat less wad ha to fit him | but let's have a luk at th' museum |  aw should like to hear one o' yor pieces aw sed if yo'd be soa gooid as to reead one | if that'll suit thee aw'll reead one an welcome | aw've noa noashun o' writin' a line tho' aw've jist dipt mi pen into th' ink towards wor kin aw don't mich incline an aw'm ommost to lazy to think |  weel aw call that a varry nice piece an if yo're aullus soa contented yo must have a happy time on it |  awm happy enuff as things goa an aw dar say aw'm as contented as th' mooast but it isn't allus safe to judge ov a chap bi what he writes for fowk often pen what they'd like things to be nor what they find 'em to be | he led th' way into another raam 'at wor filled wi boxes full o' butterflies an buzzards an twitch clocks an rare an praad he wor on 'em an then he showed me what he called his wild beeasts but they wor tame enuff for they wor nowt but catterpillers but aw believe ther wor thaasands on 'em all alive an feedin o' one sooart o' stuff or another an he tell'd me they ait a barraload o' greens ivvery day | he said he kept 'em till they come into butterflies an then he cured 'em an sent 'em away to london an sometimes to paris | th' year befoor he sent 15 000 to one man |  soa yo see awm a butterfly merchant as weel as a cobbler he sed | as we wor lukkin at 'em dolly coom up to tell us we'd better goa to us drinkin' if we wanted ony for as rubensrembrantvandyke had started ther'd varry sooin be nooan left | we tuk her advice an awm thankful to say ther wor plenty for us all an when we'd finished we went an sat ith garden an david filled his pipe an sed if awd noa objections he'd tell me hah it happened 'at he coom to live oth moor an th' reason fowk called him owd moorcock | aw sed nowt could suit me better soa he began |  yo mun know sed david 'at befoor aw gate wed an coom to live here aw lived in a little haase in a fold cloise to halifax parish church it isn't thear nah for it's been pool'd daan to mak way for improvements o' differernt sooarts an awd an idea at that time 'at aw should like to live thear all mi life an awd noa thowts aw should iver get wed |  its a pity tha ivver altered thi mind said dolly |  well happen soa but let me tell mi tale i' mi awn way an it'll be finished soa mich sooiner | one setterdy aw donn'd misen up i' mi sundy clooas an went for a walk throo th' market an when aw coom to th' butter cross aw saw a chap 'at had a cock an two hens in a basket for sale an he offered 'em to me for ten shillin' | 'ten fiddlesticks '| aw sed 'awl gie thee five ' an he put on a luk as if awd stab'd him to th' heart an begun tellin' me hah mich they'd cost him an 'at he'd nivver ha tried to sell 'em but he wor behund wi his rent an wor foorced to pairt wi 'em to keep th' bums aght an he assured me they wor layin' ivvery day | but th' fact wor aw didn't want 'em at onny price for aw'd noa place to put 'em an aw tell'd him soa | 'well ' he sed 'gie me three hawf craans an tha shall have 'em for aw think tha'll luk weel after 'em an aw wodn't like 'em to be ooined '| 'nay ' aw sed 'aw weant gie aboon five shillin' for awm nooan i' want on 'em '| 'if tha weant tha weant ' he sed soa that settles it but awd rayther let th' bums tak away nearly ivvery stick aght o'th' haase nor awd take a farden less nor seven shillin' that's th' lowest aw ivver will tak an if tha doesn't buy'em at that price tha'll rue for tha'll niver have sich a chonce ageean '| 'well then awst be like to rue ' aw sed 'for aw weant gie thee a hawpny moor nor five shilin' '| 'tha'rt a hard un ' he sed 'but if tha'll promise me tha'll treat 'em weel an at tha'll nivver tell anybody what tha's gien for 'em tha shall have 'em for six shillin' nah tha cannot say noa to that | two hens an' a cock | why it's nobbut two shillin' a piece an they're as cheap as muck at hawf a sovrin' aw think tha doesn't understand th' hen trade | awm fair sham'd to offer' em at sich a price an awm sewer aw hardly dar goa hooam wi th' brass | 'nay ' aw sed 'one word's just as gooid as a thaasand wi me an awl stick to what aw sed an if yo like to tak five shillin' awl buy' em an if net yo can keep' em '| 'tak' em wi thee ' he sed soa aw pottered aght five shillin' an he began bawlin' 'sowld agean' an aw had 'em under mi arms ommost afoor aw knew what aw wor dooin an as aw wor walkin' away he pool'd me to one side to luk at another basketful | 'nah ' he sed 'yo'd better buy theeas yo can have 'em at th' same price an they're better nor them | wod yo like a two or three ducks or a couple o' pigeons '| 'aw want noa moor to day ' aw sed 'but awst like to know if all theeas belang to yo '| 'all tha sees i' this row belangs to me ' he sed 'an if tha wants onny tha'll finnd me here ivery setterdy an awl sell thee owt aw have at thi own price ' 'well aw should think yo'll be able to keep th' bums off if yo sell all them ' aw sed an aw started for hooam but somehah aw didn't feel just as weel suited wi mi bargain as aw thowt aw should an aw wor bothered aboon a bit wi wonderin' whear to put 'em for awd noa room for 'em nobbut ith cellar an that wor as dark as a booit but hahivver aw thowt they'd be a bit o' company for me for aw wor oft varry looansome an aw should be able to have a fresh egg for mi braikfast whenivver aw liked | as sooin as aw gate hooam aw lit a cannel an went into th' cellar takkin care to shut th' door after me an then aw unteed ther legs an set 'em at liberty | they worn't a varry prime lot but aw didn't care for that for it wor th' eggs aw wanted | th' cock gave hissen a shak an set up sich a cock a doodle doo wol aw wor ommost deeafened aw nivver heeard sich a voice i' mi life if he'd been trained he'd ha been a rare leeader for a rorytory an wol aw wor wonderin' if it ud be safe to leeav 'em as they wor wol aw went to fotch 'em some screenins one oth hens flew onto th' shelf whear aw kept all mi jock an stuff | 'that'll niver do ' aw thowt soa aw went towards it to tak it off when th' cock tried to foller an wafted th' cannel aght wi his wings an let fair at th' top o' my heead so aw grabbed at th' shelf to steady misen when daan it coom wi all th' plates an pots an sich a clatter

along the twenty third street side are suites of private apartments on the ground floor occupied by permanent boarders | the various floors are reached by means of an elevator the first ever used in this country | similar arrangements are now in use in all the large hotels | the main stairway commences immediately opposite the office | it is of white marble and massive in its design | ascending it the visitor finds himself in a spacious hall at one end of which is a corridor at right angles to this hall | at the end nearest the stairs is the dining room a magnificent apartment | when the tables are filled with a handsomely dressed throng of guests at the dinner hour this room presents one of the most brilliant sights that can be witnessed on the continent | the bill of fare comprises literally everything that is in season | back of the dining room is the kitchen an immense establishment | everything connected with it goes on like clock work however so perfect is the system upon which it is managed | beneath the kitchen are the machines for warming and ventilating the hotel | by means of these a perfectly comfortable temperature is maintained in all parts of the house and the smells of the kitchen are kept out of the halls and chambers |  picture: fifth avenue hotel | at the end of the hall upon which the dining room opens are the parlors of the house | these are among the most magnificent rooms in the country | they are furnished with great taste and elegance and their windows look out immediately upon madison square | there are also several private parlors adjoining the public rooms | along the twenty third and twenty fourth street sides of the house are corridors not quite so wide but longer than the main corridor and leading off from it | the three constitute one of the pleasantest promenades to be found | the floors are covered with the richest carpets into which the feet sink noiselessly | in the day a half twilight prevails and at night a rich flood of gaslight streams along their entire length | the upper floors are occupied with private parlors rooms for guests etc | there are in this hotel pleasant quarters for 800 persons and a greater number can be accommodated in case of necessity | there are 100 suites of rooms besides the ordinary chambers | each suite comprises a parlor chamber dressing room bath room and water closet | the number of permanent boarders is about 300 | the transient arrivals average about 300 per day sometimes amounting to about twice that number | the house is expensive but its accommodations are unsurpassed and if one can get his money back anywhere in the city he can at this hotel | the house is mainly patronized by people from other parts of the state from new england and from the west | it is the most fashionable establishment in the city and will doubtless hold its present rank as long as its energetic proprietors retain the control of it | towards eight o'clock in the evening the hotel presents its most attractive features | it is full to overflowing | the lower halls the reading and sitting rooms are filled with well dressed men guests and citizens who have sauntered here from all parts of the city | four fifths are smoking and the air is hazy with the vapor of the weed | the hum of conversation is incessant but the general tone is well bred and courteous | in the farther end of the great hall a group of stock brokers may be seen comparing notes and making bargains for the sale and purchase of their fickle wares | the clink of glasses makes music in the bar room and beyond this you may see the barbers at work on their customers in the luxurious shaving saloon | doors are opening and shutting continually people are coming and going | porters are pushing their way through the crowd bearing huge trunks on their shoulders | the office bell is sounding incessantly from a dozen different chambers at once and the servants are moving about in every direction to execute the orders of the guests | on the floor above the scene is as animated but of a different character | every one here is in full dinner dress and all are on their good behaviour | the grand dining room is crowded with guests who are doing ample justice to the sumptuous viands set before them | the parlors are thronged with ladies and gentlemen and the corridors are filled with promenaders | the toilettes of the ladies are magnificent and they can be seen here to better advantage than at any ball or evening party | you may see here some of the loveliest and most refined women and some of the coarsest and vulgarest some of the most courtly gentlemen and some of the most insufferable snobs | if you will join the quiet looking man moving through the throng as if seeking some one whom he cannot find he can give you many an interesting bit of gossip about the various persons whom you will encounter in your walk | he is the detective of the house and is on the watch for improper characters | well dressed thieves will make their way into hotels in spite of the precautions of the proprietors | here a guest is comparatively safe | the detective is argus eyed and knows everybody | let a pick pocket or thief but show his face in this place and his arrest is sure | all night the corridors are patrolled by watchmen to make sure of the safety of the sleeping guests | the house is absolutely fire proof | the cost of conducting such an establishment is immense but the profits are in proportion | the average profit of this house is said to be about a quarter of a million of dollars per annum | the hotels that have been mentioned are all conducted on the american plan of full board or one charge for every expense | this enables a guest to calculate his expenses exactly and has many other advantages | many of the most fashionable houses are conducted on what is called the european plan in which a separate charge is made for room meals and every service rendered | it is said that this is more economical than the other plan and that it is less profitable to the proprietors | it is adopted by the hoffman st denis glenham brevoort coleman st james albemarle clarendon everett grand gilsey and several other prominent houses | the leading hotels of the city lie very close together the majority of them being in the vicinity of union and madison squares | this is found to be an advantage as strangers find it pleasant to visit friends who are staying at other houses | the business of hotel keeping in new york is generally very profitable | a large outlay is required at the opening of the house for furniture etc as much as from 200 000 to 500 000 being expended on the fitting up of a first class house | the furniture plate etc of the fifth avenue and grand central hotels are valued at the latter sum for each establishment | if the house meet with success a moderate sum will suffice to supply its current wants | the business is all cash and large amounts of money are received daily | the annual profits of the fifth avenue hotel are said to be about 250 000 those of the st nicholas about 200 000 | other leading houses when well managed are said to clear about twenty per cent | on the sum invested | large fortunes have been made by not a few keepers of hotels in new york | the large hotels depend entirely upon transient guests for their success | the city has perhaps the largest floating population in america | thousands come and go daily even in the summer months and these are mostly persons who have money to spend | bridal parties are constantly arriving and these are not inclined to be the most economical in their expenditures | in the spring and fall the southern and western merchants come to new york in great numbers to buy goods and are among the best customers of the hotels | thousands on business and for pleasure come and go daily and they all pour a constant stream of money into the coffers of the hotels | the smaller houses while they compete with their great rivals for transient custom rely chiefly upon their permanent guests | these are filled with families who have come to them to avoid the trouble of keeping house and who remain all through the fall winter and spring | in the summer they go to the watering places so that they pass their whole lives in hotels | they are mostly persons of wealth and fashion | as may be supposed the atmosphere of a hotel is not very favorable to domestic privacy and such establishments are vast manufactories of scandal | people imagine that they are living privately but their every action is subject to the inspection and comment of the other inmates of the house | the hotels are not the safest places for the growth of the domestic virtues | indeed it may be said that they furnish the best means of destroying them entirely | neither are they the best place for the training of children | this last however may be a minor consideration for the wives who live at the hotels seem as a rule to take care that there shall be no children to need training | small families are a necessity at such places and they remain small in that atmosphere | if another asmodeus could look down into the hotels of new york he would have some startling revelations to make which would no doubt go far to corroborate the gossip one hears in the city concerning them | the proprietors of the city hotels are very active in their efforts to exclude improper characters from their houses but with all their vigilance do not always succeed in doing so | one is never certain as to the respectability of his neighbor at the table and it is well to be over cautious in forming acquaintanceships at such places | impure women of the higher that is the more successful class and gamblers abound at the hotels | the proprietor cannot turn them out unless they are notorious until they commit some overt act for fear of getting himself into trouble | as soon however as his attention is called to any improper conduct on their part they are turned into the street no matter at what hour of the day or night | hotel proprietors are also the victims of adventurers of both sexes | these people live from house to house often changing their names as fast as they change their quarters and they are more numerous than is generally believed | one man who made himself known to the police in this way used to take his family consisting of a wife and three children to the hotels and engage the best rooms | when his bill was presented he affected to be extremely busy and promised to attend to it the next day | by the next day however he had disappeared with his family | his trunk which had been left behind was found to contain nothing but bricks and rags or paper | another adventurer would put up at the most fashionable hotels and when requested to pay his bills would feign madness | he would rave and sing and dance call himself nebuchadnezzar or george washington or some such personage and completely baffle the detectives who were for a long time inclined to believe him a bona fide madman | in this way he ran up a bill of one hundred and seventy one dollars at the fifth avenue hotel which he never paid | others do not seek to obtain lodgings at the hotels but confine their efforts to securing meals without paying for them | they get into the dining rooms along with the crowd at the meal hour and once in and seated at the table are generally safe | some two years ago as many as thirty four of this class were detected at the fifth avenue hotel in a single month | these men as they leave the dining room generally manage to secure a better hat than that they deposited on the stand in entering | under the regime of the lelands the metropolitan hotel had a colored man stationed at the door of its dining room who proved more than a match for the most expert thief | all first class hotels keep private detectives and watchmen on duty at all hours | the business of these men is to keep guard over the upper part of the house to prevent thieves from entering and robbing the rooms of the guests | suspicious persons are at once apprehended and required to give an account of themselves | some queer mishaps often befall guests of the house who are not known to the detectives | bold robberies are often effected at the hotels of the city | some time ago a thief was captured at the st nicholas and upon being searched a gold watch and chain and five different parcels of money were found upon him all of which were identified by guests as their property |xviii impostors  there is no city in the union in which impostors of all kinds flourish so well as in new york | the immense size of the city the heterogeneous character of its population and the great variety of the interests and pursuits of the people are all so many advantages to the cheat and swindler | it would require a volume to detail the tricks of these people and some of their adventures would equal anything to be found in the annals of romance | all manner of tricks are practised upon the unsuspecting and generally the perpetrator escapes without punishment | they come here from all parts of the country and indeed from all parts of the world in the hope of reaping a rich harvest and the majority end by eking out a miserable existence in a manner which even the police who watch them so closely are sometimes unable to understand | they find their way into all classes | one cannot mingle much in society here without meeting some bewhiskered mysterious individual who claims to be of noble birth | sometimes he palms himself off as a political exile sometimes he is travelling and is so charmed with new york that he makes it his headquarters and sometimes he lets a few friends into the secret of his rank and begs that they will not reveal his true title as a little unpleasant affair a mere social scandal in his own country made it necessary for him to absent himself for a while | he hopes the matter will blow over in a few months and then he will go home | the fashionable new yorker male or female is powerless against the charms of aristocracy | the foreign nobleman is welcomed everywhere feted petted and allowed almost any privilege he chooses to claim and he is far from being very modest in this respect and by and by he is found out to be an impostor probably the valet of some gentleman of rank in europe | then society holds up its hands in holy horror and vows it always did suspect him | the men in society are weak enough in this respect but the women are most frequently the victims | not long since a handsome well got up englishman came to new york on a brief visit | he called himself lord richard x | society received him with open arms | invitations were showered upon him | brown's hands were always full of cards for his lordship | the women went wild over him especially since it was whispered that the young man was heir to a property worth ever so many millions of pounds | in short his lordship found himself so popular and hints of his departure were received with such disfavor by his new found friends that he concluded to extend his stay in new york indefinitely | he made a fine show and his toilettes turnouts and presents were magnificent | the men did not fancy him | he was too haughty and uncivil but the ladies found him intensely agreeable | it was whispered by his male acquaintances that he was a good hand at borrowing and that he was remarkably lucky at cards and at the races | one or two of the large faro banks of the city were certainly the losers by his visits | the ladies however were indignant at such stories | his lordship was divine | all the women were crazy after him and any of them would have taken him at the first offer | by and by the newspapers began to take notice of the young man and boldly asserted that there was no such name as lord richard x in the british peerage | society laughed at this and declared that everybody but ignorant newspaper men was aware that the published lists of titled personages in england were notoriously incomplete | meanwhile his lordship played his cards well and it was soon announced that he was to be married shortly to a well known belle of fifth avenue | the women were green with jealousy and the men i think were not a little relieved to find that the lion did not intend devouring all the fifth avenue belles | the marriage came off in due season the wedding presents fairly poured in and were magnificent | the new lady x was at the summit of her felicity and was the envied of all who knew her | the happy pair departed on their honeymoon but his lordship made no effort to return home to england | during their absence it leaked out that lord x was an impostor | creditors began to pour in upon his father in law with anxious inquiries after his lordship against whom they held heavy accounts | proofs of the imposture were numerous and indisputable and the newspapers declared that lord x would not dare to show his face again in new york | everybody was laughing at the result of the affair | what passed between the father in law and the young couple is not known but the bride decided to cling to her husband in spite of the imposture | father in law was a prudent and a sensitive man and very rich | for his daughter's sake he accepted the situation | he paid lord x 's debts laughed at the charge of imposture and spoke warmly to every one he met of the great happiness of his dear children lord and lady x | on their return to the city he received them with a grand party at which all fifth avenue was present and though he could not silence the comments of society he succeeded in retaining for his children their places in the world of fashion | he was a nabob and he knew the power of his wealth | he shook his purse in the face of society and commanded it to continue to recognize the impostor as lord x and society meekly obeyed him | impostures of this kind do not always terminate so fortunately for the parties concerned | new york gossip has many a well authenticated story of foreign counts and lords who have set society in a flutter and have married some foolish trusting woman only to be detected when it was too late to prevent the trouble | well jim didn't spaik for he thowt the leeast sed an th' soonest mended | but shoo wornt to be done shoo at it ageean in another tone eea aw feel awm gettin waiker waiker ivery day does ta hear what aw say |  hear thi he sed mi ears are hoof'd wi harkenin to thi |  eea an they

tales as them for aw dooant believe thi shoo says tha thinks tha can get ovver me wi a bottle o' whisky aw daresay but tha'rt mistakken an' aw dooant know whear tha's getten that at this time oth' mornin | jim kept a still tongue in his bead an' crept quietly into bed an' it worn't long befoor they wor booath asleep | nah it wor varry near time for th' polieeman to come to wakken broddington an' as he knew nowt abaat th' flittin he luck'd up at th' sign an' feelin sure at he wor at th' reight shop he gave a varry gooid rat a tat at clarkson's door |  what's that | sed his wife jumpin up go daan and see |  net aw sed clarkson its nobbut some druffen chaps 'at's on for a spree |  eea an they know whear to come it seems | a'a if aw wor a man aw should shame to have sich like followin me | another rat a tat followed but clarkson wor detarmined not to get up an' th' policeman wor just as detarmined to pail at th' door till he did get up | rat a tat | rat a tat | went his stick time after time wol at last old clarkson baanced aght o' bed an threw up his winder an' axed what he wanted but when he saw a blue coat an' shinin buttons he turned raand to his wife an' sed it's a bobby |  why shoo says ax him what he wants |  what does ta want | sed clarkson |  nah then is noa gooid tryin' to mak it strange tha knows aw've come here for that whisky an' awmean to have it befoor aw goa |  o that's it is it | sed his wife |  that's thee 'at's browt me th' whisky | it's grand to bring a wife whisky an' ax a policeman to come sup it |  aw niver ax'd onybody to come aw dooant know what he wants |  that's a varry nice tale lad but tha willn't mak me believe it aw know better nor a policeman comin toa haase at hauf past three ith mornin if he hadn't been sent for | rat a tat | rat a tat tat | went th' policeman's stick an old clarkson flew to th' winder an shaats aght what th' d does ta want |  nah it's noa gooid thee puttin on an' makkin it all strange tha mud as weel come daan sooin as lat for tha'll ha to goa wi me an' th' whisky an' all soa on wi them britches an come daan stairs |  nah clarkson sed his wife sittin up i' bed tell me th' truth at once has ta getten that whisky honestly or net | if tha hasn't say so an then awst know what to expect | aw allus sed 'at tha'd bring me an th' childer to some end if this rakin aght ov a neet went on | a'a 'at ivver aw should ha lived to see this day | an then shoo began rockin hersen backards an forrads an moppin up her tears wi th' corner oth sheet | yo may guess what a din th' policeman made when it wakkened broddington 'at lived six or eight doors off an aght o' ommust ivvery winder ith row ther wor neetcaps bobbin in an aght an some on 'em shook ther heeads an sed it's nobbut what aw expected awve thowt many a time 'at if clarkson could afford to dress his wife 'i silks an satins 'at it didn't all come aght o' th' puttaty trade an after that feelin remark they went back to bed | broddington gate up an dressed an went daan stairs to see what wor up | all at once he bethowt him abaat th' policeman an th' fact a' th' wrang sign being ovver th' door an he saw at once what a mistak had been made |  well it can't be helped he sed but poor clarkson 'll catch it aw'll bet | soa he went daan an oppened th' door just at th' same time at clarkson wor comin aght | when th' policeman saw clarkson come aght an broddington abaat twenty yards off he luk'd a trifle soft an after starin furst at one an then at t'other he gave vent to his astonishment bi sarin blow me tight | just then mrs clarkson's heead show'd aght o' th' chamber winder o it's all varry fine shoo sed aw see ha it is it's a made up doo throo th' beginin to th' endin but awl have an alteration as sure as my name's liddy: after sayin this shoo popt back agean an went to bed noa daat thinkin 'at shoo wor a varry ill used woman | as matters had getten to this pitch broddington tuk th' policeman an' clarkson on to his haase an after a gooid deeal a explanation ivery body seem'd to be satisfied an broddington browt aght a bottle an put it i' th' middle o' th' table an invited 'em to help thersen | they did an readily too for th' policeman worn't a teetotaler an ther's summat abaat that 'at aw could nivver understand for teetotal lecterers tell us 'at if all th' world wor teetotal 'at we should have noa murders noa robberies noa rows all wod be peace an happiness an th' millenium be ushered in an yet aw nivver met a teetotal policeman tho ther may be sich like things th' same as aw've heeard on ther bein white blackburds an we know 'at policemen are th' varry chaps 'at have to keep th' peace | well glass followed glass an broddington decided net to set off at all but to spend a friendly haar wi 'em as he'd been th' cause ov a deeal o' bother an he thowt th' best thing he could do wod be to apologize like a man an set things straight agean | soa they all turned aght together at about a quarter to ten to goa to clarkson's but when they gate aght o' th' door what should they see but a lot o' furniture aghtside an all th' appearances ov another flittin |  what's up nah clarkson | sed broddington |  nay aw dooant know he sed but it seems to me 'at th' wife's sellin up an shoo's sed shoo wod do monny a time but awl put a stop to that an sharply too | away he went in a reglar tiff an wanted to know who'd fotch'd his stuff aght o' th' haase an sed he'd let' em see who wor th' maister thear | when his wife coom shoo wor fair maddled an wanted to know what wor up |  who's tell'd thee to sell th' furniture he sed |  sell th' furniture | who is selling th' furniture fooil | it's nobbut me 'at had it taen aght to cleean becoss aw thowt tha wor off for th' day an aw thowt awd do it before tha come back sea as tha wodn't be put abaat wi th' bustle |  o that's all reight he sed |  aw see nah aw hardly thowt tha'd do as ill as that though tha wor awful crusty this mornin but ther's broddington an th' policeman aghtside 'at want to come in an explain matters a bit |  dooant bring' em here shoo sed tha's been wi them to oft it's sich like as them 'at's leeadin thee off |  well we'd better have 'em in aw think an hear what they've to say he sed | soa they went in an when they'd tell'd th' tale shoo laff'd as hard as any on 'em for shoo worn't a bad bottom'd woman though she had a tongue soa after makkin all things straight shoo ax'd' em to have a drop o' summat which they had an as shoo sed drink o' ony sooart wor a thing 'at shoo seldom or iver touched though th' doctors had ordered it for her time after time yet considerin 'at broddington had missed his cheap trip an 'at all matters had been put to reights shoo made hersen a drop o' whisky an hot watter an as they sat tawkin an smookin they coom to th' conclusion 'at it wor nivver safe to judge bi appearances | clarkson wor soa pleased at his wite takkin it i' sich a philosophical way wol he bowt her a new gaan an when th' naybors saw her turn aght in it th' next sunday they nodded an smiled at her as if they could like to put her into ther pockets but as sooin as shoo'd turned her back they curl'd ther nooas an turned up th' whites o' ther eyes an sed in a varry mysterious way it'll do woll it lasts | a'a dear i tak my advice an nivver trust to appearances | mi first testimonial | young gawthorp lived at t'cat i t'well some on yo may know him he used to come to halifax twice i' th' wick to buy his greens and stuff to hawk an' he allus call'd at t'tabor to get a pint as he went hooam | nah chairley his mother had kursen'd him chairley becoss shoo wor sittin in a chair th' furst time shoo saw him well chairley worn't like some country hawbucks at fancied' coss he sell'd puttates an turnips 'at he needed no mooar knowledge nor to be able to tell th' difference between a parsnip an' a manglewurzell | noa chairley had an inquirin' mind an' if it hadn't been at one leg wor shorter nor t'other he'd a been a sowdger for his heart wor as brave as any greengrocer's heart cud be expected to be | one neet he'd been to th' taan an' wor trudgin hooam beside owd testy that's his donkey's name an' aw owt to tell yo hah it happen'd to be call'd testy ther's nowt like explainin' things as we goa on | chairley used to goa to th' sunday skooil an' he wor allus soa weel behaved an' hardly ivver missed a sunday withaat bringin' his taicher awther a apple or toffy or summat wol th' superintendant took sich a fancy to him 'at he determined to get up a testimonial for him soa one day he call'd him to one side an' strokin' his heead as tenderley as if it wor a whin bush he sed chairley tha's been a gooid lad an' we ar detarmin'd to get up a testimonial for thi | aw've mentioned it to th' taichers an' they've all agreed to subscribe an aw want thee to say what shape it shall tak |  well said chairley if aw'm to pick aw should like it to be as near th' shape o' tim hardy's as yo can get |  what dusta meean | sed th' superintendent |  aw mean tim hardy's donkey |  nay chairley that'll nivver do for a sundy skooil to give a donkey for a testimonial that wodn't spaik weel for th' skooil think ageean lad |  ther's nowt else at aw'd like soa if yo cannot gie me that it matters little to me what aw get an' as for net spaikin weel for th' skooil aw dooan't see that balaam's ass spake varry weel for him an' aw dooan't see but what one mud spaik varry weel for th' taichers | he proposed to spend his meal times during the rationless and moneyless days of march reading the correspondence quite enough to engage a man's whole attention during at least that period | april 1st 1916 duly arrived and with it the renewal of the sergeant's food question what again | i asked irritably | but the field cashier who was first approached on april 3rd wasn't in the least irritated | the subject interested him from the start | moreover argumentative by nature though he undoubtedly was he was all anxiety to pay | first however there were one or two trifling formalities to be observed |  you see he explained i can only pay out upon an authority | with some confidence and no little pride we opened our despatch case and produced our correspondence | he read every word of it his pay corporal did the same and very kindly explained it to us all as he went along |  this they agreed is your authority to get the money | what i want is an authority to pay it | with expressions of mutual esteem we parted for the day agreeing to give the matter our most earnest consideration during the week which must elapse before his return for the next pay day | we spent a busy week interviewing the forty nine officers and anyone else we could get to listen | only from the camp commandant did we get anything approaching enthusiasm | camp commandants are men of a patient disposition and a never failing sympathy what is better still they invariably possess a sergeant major of unscrupulous if altruistic cunning | we presented ourselves at the pay office on april 10th armed with every possible form of literature over the camp commandant's signature which any reasonable field cashier could possibly want to read | the field cashier was very pleased to see us we were very pleased to see him | it was a most happy reunion | only the command paymaster's presence was wanted to make the thing a success | the field cashier gave his address dispensed with the sergeant's presence at all future meetings and postponed all further proceedings in the matter till april 17th | if there was any lack of graciousness in the correspondence with the c p m this was i must at once say on my side | he wanted to oblige but being human he must have his authority | i sent him the authority to get and the authority to pay | his reply was to the effect that both were perfectly delightful and in the very best taste but what was wanted before he could authorize payment was an authority to have the account in england credited with the necessary fund | for the first time in my life i positively loathed england | bit by bit however the c p m | softened but he hadn't softened quite enough to satisfy our field cashier by april 24th | well as aw wor sayin' chairley an' testy wor gooin' hooam an' bed just getten to th' tabor when they booath stopt for a drink | he teed up his donkey an' then went into th' tapraam for a pint a fourpny yo can get varry gooid fourpny at t'tabor ther's some body in it an noa sperrit hah they brew it is a saycret an' it's noa use tryin' to see throo it | just anent chairley sat an owd sowdger tellin' tales abaaght different battles he'd been in an' chairley lizened to ivvery word as if it wor gospel for ov cooarse he knew at noa man 'ats been in a battle wad say owt at worn't true an' at last he sed captin' aw've oft thowt aw should like to be sowdger but yo see mi legs isn't booath just t'same length |  that'll mak little difference he sed tha'd be all th' better for that it wodn't be as easy to put a bullet throo thi heead when it wor bobbin' up and daan as it wod a chap at walk'd straight but aw should advise thee to join th' artillery that's th' regiment for thee horse artillery that's the ticket tha'd just doo for that |  dun yo think aw should |  to be sewer tha'rt just made for it | this set chairley a thinkin' an after treatin' th' owd sowdger wi' a pint he set off hooam | as he'd noab'dy else to tawk to' he tawk'd to th' donkey |  well testy what dus ta think abaaght it | dus ta think aw should doo for a hartillery chap | they dooant have donkeys i'th' horse hartillery or else awd tak thee | what are ta shakin' thi heead at | well if aw doo goa iwl mak a present o' thee to th' sunday skooil for aw cudn't tell what price to put on thi if aw wanted to sell thi | hahivver aw think it ud be a gooid thing for me to practiss a bit an' awve two owd muskets at hooam at can be made come in an' awl get up it' mornin' i' gooid time an practiss for an haar or soa befooar we start for bizness | it'll doo us booath gooid | chairley gate hooam an' after stablin' testy an' makkin him cumfortable he gave him a bit o' extra corn to mak him lively next mornin' | he left t'stable sayin well testy aw nivver thowt a makkin a war horse aght o' thee tho' awve seen war horses nor thee but to morn tha'll have to be a chairger an' if tha'rt hauf as gooid a chairger as t'chap wor at sell'd thi to th' superintendent tha'll doo to practiss on | t'next mornin' chairley gate his two muskets an havin' teed one on th' top o' each pannier he maanted testy an' rooad him to a croft at back o' th' haase |  nah he says to hissen hah can aw pull these triggers when aw'm set up here | it caan't be done but if aw lig on my belly on th' top of his back aw can raich 'em then an that'll be a better position to escape th' enemy | soa he ligg'd his full length o' testy's back an tuk hold o' booath muskets wi' his fingers on th' triggers |  nah testy see tha behaves thisen' for this may be a turnin' point i' thy life as weel as mine | tha'll ha' to get used to th' smell o' paather same as me | nah for it he sed an' he shut his een an' whisper'd one two three off | he pooled booath triggers booath muskets went off an' chairley went off at th' same time an' soa did one o' testy's ears an' when chairley lukk'd up testy wor stanin' on his fore legs sparrin' away wi' his heels as lively as yo'd wish to see | chairley maniged to sam hissen together an' findin' at he worn't killed he went to mak friends ageean wi' testy an' if ivver ther wor two disconsolate lukkin' jackasses i' this world it wor them two |  well this is a bonny come off he sed tha'rt a bigger donkey nor aw tuk thi for | had ta noa mooar sense nor to put thi ear i'th' front ova gun | tha cud a heeard it goa off withaat lizenin' soa clois |  well aw wish tha wor nicely aght o' mi hands | what to do wi thi nah aw connot tell unless aw cut off t'other ear to match an' tee a bunch o' horsehair to thi tail an' see if aw connot mak a galloway aght on thi an' if aw doo that aw expect tha willn't be able to keep thi maath shut an' that voice o' thine 'll let ivvery body know | but hahivver aw mun try an' bandage that heead o' thine up an' then see what aw can do for ther'll be noa hawkin' to day an' noa mooar hartillery practiss | chairley weshed th' donkey's heead an' put some sauve on to his ear an' teed it up as weel as he cud an' then turned him inta th' croft an' sat daan wonderin' hah to spend th' day | nah ther wor nowt chairley wor fonder on nor kite flyin' an' as he had a kite ommost as big as hissen he thowt he mud as weel amuse hissen a bit soa he fotched it an' befooar monny minnits it wor sailin' away up i'th' air | he kept givin' it mooar band wol it wor ommost aght o' seet an' beein' a breezy day it pooled soa hard at he cud hardly hold it | to mak matters war testy wor varry restless an' kept wanderin abaaght an' as ther wor noa gate to th' croft chairley had to follow him for feeard on him gettin' away | in a while it began to be rayther hard wark he darn't let t'kite goa an' ther wor nowt handy to tee it too soa he thowt his best plan 'ud be to pull it in but just then a thowt struck him as he saw testy trottin' off whiskin his tail an' he went after him | as sooin as he'd catched him he teed his kite band to th' donkey's tail sayin' as he did soa nah aw can watch yo booath at once | but yo shud a seen that donkey | at first he ran backards for abaaght a dozzen yards then he shot aght his heels wi' twenty donkey paar but it wor noa use tryin' to kick that kite he cud just as easy ha' kicked t'mooin | he tried to turn raand but that ommost twisted his tail off then he planted his feet firmly i' t'graand wi his tail stickkin' straight aght like a brooish stail an' luk'd at chairley as if for some explanation |  well hah dusta like kite flyin' testy | tha'd a rooar'd thi 'een up afooar tha'd thowt a that | it's plain to be seen at tha connot run away wi' that kite an' th' kite connot flyaway wi' thee soa awl leeave yo an' goa get a bit a dinner | he worn't long away but when he coom back noa kite cud he see but theear wor testy stud just as he'd left him | as chairley walked to him he nivver sturd but fancy his surprise when he saw at th' donkey's tail wor missin' | it had dissolved partnership wi' testy an' gooan to realms aboon | maybe it'll fessen it sen on to some little star an' mak a comet on't | chairley an testy stud lukkin' at one another for a gooid five minnits an' at last chairley sed well testy tha caan't blame me aw dooant think thi appearance is mich improved but still tha must admit at tha arn't as mich of a donkey nah as tha wor when aw gate tha | it seems to me we'd better pairt for we dooan't get on soa weel together awl sell mi stock an't panniers an' thee an ivverything aw shall ha' to sell' em wholesale though for aw cannot re tail thee | but awl promise tha one thing whenivver aw fly a kite ageean awl remember mi donkey's tail | just then testy's knees begun to tremmle his body rock'd from side to side he luk'd at chairley as mich as to say assassin an rowled ovver brokkenhearted an' withaght a struggle he breathed his last sigh to th' tune of good bye chairley when aw'm away dunnot forget your testimonial | five paand nooat | aw remember th' first time at aw iver had a five paand nooat an' awm like as if aw can see it yet | it worn't a new en it wor one 'at had gooan throo a gooid monny hands it wor soft an' silky to th' touch an' it wor yeller wi age an' th' edges wor riven a bit an it had a split up th' middle whear it had been cut i' two at some time an' stuck together agean wi a bit o' postage stamp paper | aw remember at that time aw used to sleep up in a garret all bi mysen an' th' walls wor covered wi bits o' pictures an' shelves wor stuck up here an' thear filled wi bottles o' all maks o' stuff an' aw'd an old box 'at aw could lock up whear aw kept some pipes an bacca an' owt else at aw darn't let awr fowk know 'at aw had an' carefully put away under th' bed wor another little box whear aw kept cannels | awm just th' same as if aw can see mysen nah as aw wor then sat daan oth edge oth bed an' th' five paand nooat on th' table anent me studdyin what to buy | she has to buy fuel in the winter and kindling wood costs her three cents a bundle and coal fifteen cents a pail | perhaps she has children or a sick and helpless or worse still a drunken husband to provide for | all out of her beggarly wages | her food consists almost entirely of bread and potatoes and sometimes she treats herself to the luxury of a cup of tea without milk or sugar | if she owns a sewing machine and very few do she can earn more than one who sews by hand but constant work at the machine means a speedy breaking down of her health and a lingering death or a transfer to the charity hospital | small as are her wages the working woman is not always sure of receiving them | some rascally employers and one of the institutions to be mentioned further on could give a long list of them will upon receiving the work find fault with the sewing and either deduct a part of the poor creature's wages for the alleged fault or refuse point blank to pay her a cent | others again will demand a deposit equal to the value of the materials taken home by the sewing women | upon the return of the completed work they will not only refuse the promised payment alleging that the work is badly done but will also refuse to return the money advanced by the woman | the wretch well knows that the woman is weak and helpless and that she is ignorant of the mode of protecting herself | more than this she has not the money to go to law | these are simple facts and not sensational items | the records of the working women's protective union will corroborate them and will furnish many others |  among the employes of a certain israelitish manufacturer of straw goods in new york was a poor french woman who with her three small children occupied apartments in a rear tenement house in mulberry street | what renders this case of more than ordinary interest is the fact that the lady had once been in affluent circumstances and at one period of her life moved in the wealthiest circles of paris | misfortune befel her in the death of her husband who was accidentally killed upon a railroad train | the bulk of the property of her deceased husband was seized upon by her creditors | the widow however succeeded in saving from the general wreck a few hundred dollars and with this she emigrated to america arriving here in the spring and bringing with her three little children | here she anticipated she would be enabled with the aid of her superior education to provide for herself and family | 'you are right sir ' he sed 'i see you understand them i wish there were a few more like you '| an then he sed in a whisper 'at that wor th' only box he had o' that sooart in fact ther'd niver nobbut been that an' another a'n t'other wor sent as a present to th' duke o' wellington but th' duke he sed wornt hauf as gooid a judge as aw wor an' he'd sell me that box for two paand an' it wor worth three | aw wor beginnin to feel a bit sickly wi that aw wor smokin an' aw didn't care to tawk mich an' as he hadn't given me onny change aw just nodded mi heead and he had lapped up th' box in a crack and handed it me an three soverings an' wished me gooid day an hoped aw'd call agean and bowed me aght oth shop i' less time nor it taks to tell it | as sooin as awd getten a few yards away aw threw mi cigar into th' street an' detarmined aw'd niver smook agean befoore braikfast | them cigars didn't last long for ov coarse aw allus carried a lot i' mi pocket an' as that used to spoil' em a friend o' mine persuaded me to buy a cigar case | he sell'd it me varry cheap nobbut ten shillin an' then another gate me to subscribe a guinea to a cricket club an' aw wondered ha it wor 'at aw'd niver made friends wi' some o'th' members befoor for they wor a nice lot | at th' end of three days mi cigars wor all done an' soa wor mi five paand nooat | all aw had wor a empty cigar box a pastboard cigar case worth abaat sixpence a ticket 'at entitled me to visit all th' cricket matches free but as th' season wor just endin it wor o' noa use an' had a sooart ov an inklin 'at ther wor some truth i'mi father's words 'at aw worn't old enuff to be trusted wi' brass | aw went to bed an' fell asleep withaat once thinkin abaat thieves an' ther's noa daat 'at what yo loise i' brass yo oft tinles gain i' knowledge for aw niver forgate th' fate o mi furst five paand nooat | silly billy | he wor a queer sooart of a chap wor billy allus makkin a fooil ov hissen or else somedy wor makkin a fooil o' him | he wor a very quiet chap too tho ivery nah an' then he gave hissen a bit ov a leetnin' i'th' shap ov a rant or as he used to call it a 'gooid brust '| it woint oft he did that sooart o' thing but when he did he carried it on for a wick or a fortnit an' altho' his father had left a nice little farm for him an' his mother yet it sooin dwindled to nowt for what wi' neglectin his wark an' spendin a bit o' brass it wor like a cannel lit at booath ends it sooin swealed up | aw remember one day when he'd been drinkin till his brass wor done he coom hooam to ax his mother to give him some moor an' coss shoo said shoo wod'nt he declared he'd set th' lathe o' fire but sho wodn't give him onny soa he went into th' lathe an' in a bit one o'th' neighbors saw him gaping at tother side o'th' street an' went up to ax him what he wor starin at |  it'll tinkle tip in a bit sed billy an' in a bit it did 'tinkle up ' for he'd set th' haymoo o' fire an' in abaght an haar booath th' lathe an' all 'at wor in it wor burned to th' graand |  aw tell'd her aw'd do it he sed an' aw'm

system o' her's wor allus to do iverything like clock wark | when billy wor having one ov his bits o' sprees an' stoped away for two or three days shoo allus made him his porrige ivery marnin an' if he worn't thear to ait 'em shoo put' em i'th' cupbord all in a row an' when he did come he could'nt get a bite o' owt else till he'd finished' em all soa he used to start at th' oldest furst an' as th' owd woman kept on makkin moor ivery mornin it wor noa easy job to ovettak 'em an' be able to sit daan to a warm meal | but like monny a one beside altho' he wor soa mich put abaght it did'nt cure him but when he'd had a doo an' been two or three days at cold poltices as he call'd em he used to say niver noa moor | if aw once get ovver this yo'll niver catch me at that bat agean | it's towt me a lesson 'as this | an' noa daat it had but he varry sooin forgate it | ov coarse when th' brass wor all done he had to work a bit an' aw recollect when he started business ov his own hook fowk used to plague him sadly an' weel they mud for he gate a donkey an panniers an' started to sell puttates an' greehs but it soa happened 'at one mornin he'd nobbut as monny puttates as ud fill one pannier an' as he put' em i' one it made it side heavy soa he gate a lot o' big stooans an' put 'em i'th' tother to balance it a bit an' then he started off | but he hadn't gooan far when a chap met him an' sed what are ta sellin billy |  aw'm hawkin puttates he sed |  why what's all thease stooans for has ta started o' leeadin balder |  noa he sed an' then gave him a sly wink as mich as to say aw'l let

mony a bit | one queer thing abaght him wor he delighted i' singing an' if he heeard a song 'at took his fancy he could remember it word for word | his mother says 'at he's tramped mony a scoor mile to hear a song at pleased him an' if ony body'd sing for him he'd give' em owt he had | one day as he wor gooin his raands he met wi a chap 'at wor hummin a bit ov a tune an' he hearken'd to him for a bit an' at last he sed maister aw should like to know that song ha mich will yo taich it me for |  oh it's a patent is that lad aw should want a gooid deal if aw towt thee that |  why he said aw'l gie

donkey an' as mony puttates as he could hug an' billy started off hooam wi his panniers ov his rig singin aw live an' aw'm jolly wi such gusto wol th' fowk coom aght to see whativer ther wor to do an' when they saw him huggin th' panniers they guessed what wor up an' shook ther heeads sarin silly billy | ov coorse when he gate hooam he tell'd his mother abaght it an' wad have her listen to this new song |  song be hanged | shoo sed aw'd a deal rather hear that donkey rant nor all th' songs at iha con cram into thi empty heead | an' away shoo went to get some fowk to follow th' chap an' get th' donkey back agean | two or three sooin set off an' within a few yards o' where billy sed he'd been they fan it quietly nibblin a bit o' grass bith' side o' th' gutter for it seems th' chap had nobbut been havin a bit ov a joak an' left it behund | they gate it hooam agean an'after billy's mother had given him a gooid tawkin to th' thing dropt | but aw think aw'st niver forget a marlock some chaps played him one day: ther wor abaat six on 'em an' they made it up to freeten him a bit an' mak him believe he wor baan to dee soa just as he coom off th' corner o' one o' th' streets a chap steps up

next time tha wants to mak a fooil ov a chap start o' somdy 'at's less wit nor this en an' then tha weant be dropt on | that wornt a bad move ov a chap they call silly billy | put up wi' it | aw think aw could tell what day it wor th o' aw didn't know if aw could see a lot o' factry fowk gooin to ther wark | mondy's easy to tell becoss th' lasses have all clean approns on an' ther hair hasn't lost its sundy twists an' twines ther faces luk ruddier an' ther een breeter | tuesdy ther's a change they're not quite as prim lukkin | ther topping luk fruzzier an' ther's net as monny shignons as ther wor th' day before | wednesday they just luk like hard workin fowk 'at live to wark an' wark to live | ther's varry few faces have a smile on 'em an' th' varry way they set daan ther clogs seems to say wark a day live a day laik a day get noa pay rain or noa bun to goa | thursdy they luk cross an' ther heeads are abaat hauf a yard i' advance o' ther tooas | ther clogs seem to ha made up ther mind net to goa unless they're made | friday that's pay day | noa matter ha full ther belly may be ther's a hungry luk abaat ther een an'ther's a lot on 'em huggin baskets an' yo can see it written i' ther faces 'at if they dar leeave as sooin as they've getten ther bit o' brass they wod | then comes setterday short day an' yo can tell th' difference as sooin as yo clap een on' em | they're all i' gooid spirits | they luk at th' church clock as they pass an' think it'll sooin be nooin an' then an' then what | why then they'll have a day an' a hauf for thersen abaat one fifth o' ther life one fifth o' ther health an' strength for thersen | that doesn't luk mich but ther fain on it | they owt to be thankful becoss they live in a free country | they can suit thersen's whether they do that or go to th' workhaase | justice they say is blind an' if freedom isn't shoo must be put to th' blush sometimes | who'd be a slave when freedom smiling stands to strike the gyves from of his fettered hands | who'd be a slave and cringe and bow the knee and kiss the hand that steals his liberty | behold the bird that flits from bough to bough what though at times the wintry blasts may blow happier it feels half frozen in its nest than caged though fed and fondled and caressed | 'tis said 'on briton's shore no slave shall dwell ' but have you heard not the harsh clanging bell or the discordant whistles' yelling voice that says 'work slave or starve | such boys are apt to do well in the world | many however after being released from the stores imitate the ways of the clerks and salesmen | they affect a fastness which is painful to see in boys so young | they sport an abundance of flashy jewelry patronize the cheap places of amusement and are seen in the low concert saloons and other vile dens of the city | it is not difficult to predict the future of these boys | the principal retail dry goods stores of new york are those of a t stewart co lord taylor arnold constable co and james mccreery co | the house of a t stewart co | is the best known to persons visiting the city | indeed there are very few americans who have not heard of and longed to visit stewart's | it is besides the largest and most complete establishment of its kind in the world | the principal front is on broadway and the public entrances are on that street and on the fourth avenue | the ninth street entrances are reserved exclusively for the employes of the house | many persons speak of the edifice as a marble palace but this is incorrect | it is constructed of iron in the style of arcade upon arcade and its fronts are so thickly studded with windows that they may be said to consist almost entirely of glass | it is five stories in height above the street and above the fifth story there is an interior attic not visible from the sidewalk | below the street there is a basement and a sub cellar so that the monster building is really eight stories in height | there is no attempt at outward display the fine effect of the edifice being due to its vast size and its symmetry | the interior is as simple | the floors are uncarpeted the shelves are plain as are the counters and the customers' seats | the centre of the building is occupied by a large rotunda extending from the ground floor to the roof | all the upper floors are open around this rotunda | two flights of massive stairs lead to the upper floors and there are three handsome elevators for the use of customers who do not care to make the journey on foot | three other elevators on the ninth street side are used for carrying goods | each of the floors covers an area of about two acres so that the whole establishment including the cellar occupies sixteen acres of space | the cellar contains coal bins with a capacity of 500 tons | close by are eight harrison boilers of fifty horse power each used for operating the steam engines and warming the building with steam | there are in all ten steam engines located in this immense cellar | these are used for running the elevators for working seven steam pumps for feeding the boilers and for forcing water up to the top floor which is used as a laundry | in a certain part of the cellar is located the electrical battery by means of which the gas jets in the building are lighted | here are also rooms for the storage of goods | the basement is occupied by the carpet making and parcel departments | it is the largest room in the world and is unbroken save by the light pillars which support the floors above | the carpet making department is interesting | the house deals largely in carpets and one is surprised at the smallness of the force employed down here | the carpets purchased are cut and the pieces matched as they lie on the floor by women | then they are placed on a wide table forty feet long and are sewn together by a machine worked by steam | this machine moves along the edge of the table and the man operating it rides on it | his only care is to hold the parts to be sewn perfectly even and the machine sews a seam of forty feet in from three to five minutes | in the centre of the basement floor is a space about thirty feet square enclosed by counters | this is the parcel department | all purchases to be sent to the buyer pass through this department and these make up about ninety per cent | of the day's business | the purchases are sent here by the salesmen with a ticket affixed to each stating the quantity and quality of the article bought the amount paid and the address of the buyer | the goods are then remeasured and if an error has been made either in favor of or against the house it is rectified | the goods are then made up in secure parcels each of which is plainly marked with the address of the purchaser | these parcels are then turned over to the drivers of the wagons used by the house for delivering purchases | the drivers are furnished with bills for the amounts to be collected on the parcels and they are held to a rigid accountability for the delivery of every parcel entrusted to them and the collection of all moneys due on them | the ground floor is the principal salesroom | it is a simple but elegant apartment and its chief ornaments are the goods for sale which are displayed in the most attractive and tasteful manner | the room is 300 by 200 feet in size | it contains 100 counters with an aggregate length of 5000 feet | behind these counters are low shelves on which the goods are kept | in the centre is the immense rotunda and at various points are the little wooden pens enclosed with lattice work used by the cashiers | each article for sale has its separate department and there are thirty ushers on duty to direct purchasers where to find the articles they seek | the display of goods is magnificent and includes everything used for the clothing of ladies and children either in the piece or ready made | there is also a department in which ladies and children may have all their clothing of every description made to order | the second floor is used for the sale of ready made clothing suits upholstery etc and the third floor is the carpet salesroom | the other floors are closed to visitors and are used as workshops laundries etc | the convenience of having all these things and in such great variety under one roof is very great and saves purchasers many a weary walk through the city | the immense capital employed by mr stewart and his great facilities of all kinds enable him to control the markets in which he makes his purchases and to buy on terms which render it easy for him to undersell all his competitors | the smaller houses complain bitterly of this and declare that he is ruining them | in spite of its immense trade stewart's is not the most popular place in the city with resident purchasers | the salesmen have the reputation of being rude and often insolent | there can be no doubt that were specific complaints made mr stewart would administer the necessary punishment to the offender without delay but as the offences complained of are chiefly a lack of civility few care to complain | the throng of visitors and purchasers is immense | they have been known to reach the enormous number of 50 000 in a single day but the average is 15 000 | looking down from one of the upper floors through the rotunda one can witness as busy and interesting a scene as new york affords | all kinds of people come here from the poor woman whose scanty garb tells too plainly the story of her poverty to the wife of the millionaire whose purchases amount to a small fortune and all classes can be suited | the sales of the house average about 60 000 per day and have been known to reach 87 000 | the bulk of the purchases is made between noon and five o'clock | the average daily sales of the principal articles are as follows: silks 15 000 dress goods 6000 muslins 3000 laces 2000 shawls 2500 suits 1000 calicoes 1500 velvets 2000 gloves 1000 furs 1000 hosiery 600 boys' clothing 700 yankee notions 600 embroideries 1000 carpets 5500 |  picture: a t stewart's retail store | as may be supposed the business of this great house requires an army of employes | the force consists of 1 general superintendent 19 superintendents of departments 9 cashiers 25 book keepers 30 ushers 55 porters 200 cash boys 900 seamstresses working women laundresses etc 320 salesmen and saleswomen and 150 salesmen and others in the carpet department making a total of 1709 persons | there are other persons employed about the establishment in various capacities and these with the extra help often employed make the aggregate frequently as much as 2200 persons | the business of the house opens at seven a m and closes at seven p m | all the employes have thirty minutes allowed them for dinner | one half of all are alternately dismissed at six o'clock each evening | all the employes when leaving must pass through a private door on ninth street | on each side of this door is a detective of great experience whose business it is to see that none of the employes carry away with them any of the property of the house | the discipline of the establishment is very rigid and is enforced by a system of fines and other penalties | the general management of the house is entrusted to mr tellur the general superintendent but mr stewart gives it his personal supervision as well | he comes to the store every morning at ten o'clock precisely and consults with mr tellur about the business of the previous day and the wants of that just opening | he goes through the entire establishment and personally acquaints himself with the exact condition of the business | he knows everything connected with the retail store and every detail of its management receives his constant supervision and is conducted in accordance with his instructions | he remains here about an hour and a half in the morning and returns at five o'clock in the afternoon and spends half an hour more | the rest of his working day is passed at his lower store |  picture: lord and taylor's dry goods store | lord taylor rank next to stewart and are a more popular firm with residents than the latter | they occupy a magnificent iron building at the corner of broadway and twentieth street | it is one of the finest and most picturesque edifices in the city and is filled with a stock of goods equal in costliness and superior in taste to anything that can be bought at stewart's | on opening days or days when the merchants set out their finest goods for the inspection of the public lord taylor generally carry off the palm for the handsomest and most tasteful display | the show windows of this house are among the sights of broadway | two blocks below on the same side of broadway is a row of magnificent white marble stores | the upper end comprising about one third of the entire block is occupied by messrs | arnold constable co a popular and wealthy house | they are noted for the taste and general excellence of their goods | james mccreery co at the corner of broadway and eleventh street occupy a part of the ground floor of the magnificent edifice of the methodist book concern | they do not make as extensive a display as their competitors but are well known in the city for their rich and elegant goods | the ball and wedding dresses imported and made by this house are among the richest ever seen in new york |xxiv  bleecker street | perhaps very few people out of the great city know bleecker street at all perhaps they have passed it a dozen times or more without noticing it or if they have marked it at all have regarded it only as a passably good looking street going to decay | but he who does not know bleecker street does not know new york | it is of all the localities of the metropolis one of the best worth studying | it was once the abode of wealth and fashion as its fine old time mansions testify | then broadway north of it was the very centre of the aristocracy of the island and bond street was a primitive fifth avenue | going west from the bowery nearly to sixth avenue you will find rows of stately mansions on either hand which speak eloquently of greatness gone and as eloquently of hard times present | they have a strange aspect too and one may read their story at a glance | twenty five years ago they were homes of wealth and refinement | the most sumptuous hospitality was dispensed here and the stately drawing rooms often welcomed brilliant assemblages | now a profusion of signs announce that hospitality is to be had at a stated price and the old mansions are put to the viler uses of third rate boarding houses and restaurants | in many respects bleecker street is more characteristic of paris than of new york | it reminds one strongly of the latin quarter and one instinctively turns to look for the closerie des lilas | it is the headquarters of bohemianism and mrs grundy now shivers with holy horror when she thinks it was once her home | the street has not entirely lost its reputation | no one is prepared to say it is a vile neighborhood no one would care to class it with houston mercer greene or water streets but people shake their heads look mysterious and sigh ominously when you ask them about it | it is a suspicious neighborhood to say the least and he who frequents it must be prepared for the gossip and surmises of his friends | no one but its denizens whose discretion can be absolutely trusted knows anything with certainty about its doings or mode of life but every one has his own opinion | walk down it at almost any hour of the day or night and you will see many things that are new to you | strange characters meet you at every step even the shops have a bohemian aspect for trade is nowhere so much the victim of chance as here | you see no breach of the public peace no indecorous act offends you but the people you meet have a certain air of independence of scorn of conventionality a certain carelessness which mark them as very different from the throng you have just left on broadway | they puzzle you and set you to conjecturing who they are and what they are and you find yourself weaving a romance about nearly every man or woman you meet | that long haired queerly dressed young man with a parcel under his arm who passed you just then is an artist and his home is in the attic of that tall house from which you saw him pass out | it is a cheerless place indeed and hardly the home for a devotee of the muse but the artist is a philosopher and he flatters himself that if the world has not given him a share of its good things it has at least freed him from its restraints and so long as he has the necessaries of life and a lot of jolly good fellows to smoke and drink and chat with him in that lofty dwelling place of his he is content to take life as he finds it | if you look up to the second floor you may see a pretty but not over fresh looking young woman gazing down into the street | she meets your glance with composure and with an expression which is a half invitation to come up | she is used to looking at men and to having them look at her and she is not averse to their admiration | her dress is a little flashy and the traces of rouge are rather too strong on her face but it is not a bad face | you may see her to night at the theatre where she is the favorite | not much of an actress really but very clever at winning over the dramatic critics of the great dailies who are but men and not proof against feminine arts | tha's browt moor milk nor ud feed all th' childer i' silsden for a month |  doant yo' be feeared abaat th' milk sed burt awl pay for it let it have summat to ait | tun summat into it |

adventure an' as he could hear all 'at wor sed he furst began to feel uneasy an' then to loise his temper soa he seized his crutch an' ran daan stairs like a lad o' sixteen an' laid abaat him reight an' left an' i' less nor a minit burt th' cunstable an' owd mary wor aghtside |  nah he sed as he stood i' th' doorhoil puffin' an' blowin' wi' his crutch ovver his shoulder like a musket aw'll let yo see whose child that is | it wor fun i' my field an' it belangs to me | what my land produces belangs to me noa matter whether it's childer or chicken weed | things wor i' this state when one o' th' dowters showed her heead aght o' th' winder an' cried mother it's wakkened an' it's suckin' it's thumb as if it wor clammed to deeath |  mary sed th' owd man does ta mean to starve that child to deeath | coss if tha cannot luk after it aw'll luk after it mysel' | this wor th' signal for all to goa inside an' a bonnier pictur' yo nivver saw nor that war when owd mary sat wi' that little thing on her lap givin' it sops an' three big strong but kind hearted fellows sat raand watchin' ivvery bit it tuk as if ther own livin' depended on it | ther war a gooid deeal o' 'fendin' an' provin' but whear that child coom fra an' who wor it's mother noabody could tell | time passed an' as mary sed th' child thrived like wood an' ivverybody called it burt's babby | burt wor a decent hard workin' lad an' had for a long time luk'd longin'ly at one o' mary's dowters an' one day ther wor a stir i' th' village an' burt war seen donned up like a dummy at a cloas shop an' wi' a young woman linked to

th' parson monny minits to tee' em together for better an' for worse an' then burt took th' babby an' gave it to his bride sayin' here's summat towards haase keepin' anyway | an' shoo tuk it an' kussed it as if it had been ther own | they went to live at a nice little farm an' th' owd fowk gave' em a gooid start | sally bray had allus shown a fondness for burt's babby 'at fowk could hardly accaant for an' shoo went an' offered her sarvices as sarvant an' nurse an' nivver did ony body seem soa fond of a child as sally did o' that | things went on nicely for a while an' then th' scarlet fever coom every day saw long sorrowful processions follerin' little coffins an' ivery body luk'd sad an' spake low | at last burt's babby wor takken sick an' all they could do couldn't save it an' early one mornin' it shut it's een an' went its way to join those 'at had gone before | burt an' his wife wor varry mich troubled but it war sally bray 'at suffered mooast | they couldn't get her to leave that cold still form soa they left her with it till her grief should be softened an' when some time had passed they went to call her but it wor no use for her spirit had goan to tend burt's babby | after shoo wor buried some papers were picked aght o' one o' sally's boxes and it were sed' at they explained all but what they were burt an' his wife nivver telled so it still remains a

tommy wor allus considered to be th' tip top in his trade | his worn't a common sooart ov a callin like wayvin or spinnin or coil leeadin | he nobbut had to deal wi'th' heeads o'th' community | th' fact is he wor a barber an' ther's monny a chap at awd moor o' thear gooid fortun to th' way he fixed up th' aghtside o' thear heeads nor what they did to th' fixin i'th' inside | aw've monny a time thowt when aw've seen him thrang 'at his trade wor just a reight schooil for a chap to gaa to to leearn to have contempt for wod be gurt fowk for aw've seen chaps come in lukkin as fierce as a pot lion an ommost makkin yo tremel wi' th' way they sed' gooid mornin ' but as sooin as they've getten set daan an' a gurt print table cloth tucked under ther chin an' lathered up to ther een they've sat as quiet an' luk'd as sheepish as a chap' at's just been to see his sweetheart get wed | well ther wor nobbut one thing 'at tommy aspired to moor nor what he had an' that wor to be a deacon | net 'at he knew owt abaat what a deacon owt to be or owt to do but becoss a chap 'at used to goa to th' same schooil when they wor lads had getten made a deacon at th' starvhoil baptists' chapel an' tommy didn't like to be behund hand an' then agean ther wor a woman in th' case | tommy had allus been a pretty regular attender at auther one chapel or another but he'd niver stuck to one i' particular for he liked to hear different preachers an' he didn't feel varry anxious to pay pew rent | but just abaat this time summat happened 'at made a change in him | cloise to whear he lived ther wor a chap 'at kept a sausage shop an' he wor takken sick an' deed an' his widder sent for tommy to come an' shave him befoor he wor burrid an' he did it i' sich a nice an' considerate way an' tawked soa solemn an' pooled sich a long face 'at he gate invited to th' funeral an wor axed to be one o'th' bearers an' as he nobbut stood abaat four feet in his booits he consented at once for as t'other five chaps all stood abaat six feet he knew he wodn't have mich to carry | when th' funeral wor nicely ovver an' they gate back to th' haase they wor all invited to stop an' have a bit o' summat to ait an' as sausage wor th' handiest o' owt to cook shoo axed 'em if they'd have some | nubdy'd owt to say agean it but tommy didn't seem satisfied an' when th' widder saw it shoo sed 'may be tommy sausage doesn't agree wi' yo is thear owt else yo'd like '|  well he sed aw've nowt agean sausage but aw think 'at black pudding wad be moor appropriate for a burrin |  tha'd happen like black beer to swill it daan sed one |  nah yo 'at want sausage can have it an' them 'at likes black puddin can have that shoo sed '| an' varry sooin ther wor a dish o' booath befoor' em but nubdy seemed to fancy th' black pudding nobbut tommy an aw dooant think he enjoyed' em mich for they worn't varry fresh | 'get some moor tommy ' shoo sed 'it does me gooid to see you ait 'em for they wor the last thing awr jack made i' this world an' aw like to see some respect paid to him | he little thowt when he wor makkin them 'at he'd be deead wi' th' small pox an' burrid in a wick '| wi' this shoo began to cry an' as th' mourners kept leavin one bi one ther wor sooin nubdy left but tommy to sympathise wi' her an' as ivery time he sed owt shoo shoved him another black puddin on his plate he began to think it time he went hooam for if shoo kept on at that rate it wodn't tak long to mak another burrin | in a bit he wor forced to stop an' he sed he thowt it wor time for him to goa but shoo put her hand on his heead an' luk'd daan at him soa sorrowful like as shoo lifted daan a black bottle aght o'th' cubbord wol he couldn't find in his heart to leave her soa sittin daan they had a drop o' gin an' watter together for shoo wanted some to draand her sorrow an he wanted summat to settle his stummack | then he began lukkin raand an' he wor capt to find what a nice comfortable haase shoo had an' all th' furniture as gooid as new and ivery glass he tuk he fancied shoo wor better lukkin nor he'd seen her befoor an' as he didn't offer to leave as long as th' gin lasted bi th'time it wor done he thowt he'd niver seen a widder 'at suited him as weel an' as he wanted a wife he couldn't help thinkin 'at he mud do wor nor try to find room thear to hing his hat up | he knew at shoo wor varry nicely off an' could affoord to live withaat th' sausage shop an' although shoo wor big enuff to mak two sich chaps as him he didn't think that wor onny objection | he niver knew exactly ha he gate hooam that neet but he went to bed an' dreamt 'at he wor riding in a hearse to get wed to th' widder an' th' trees on booath sides o'th' road wor hung wi' garlands o' black pudding | two months had passed an' tommy hadn't let his sympathy stop wi' th' funeral but used to call regularly once a wick to see her an' allus went to the same chapel ov a sunday an' tuk care to dress all i' black an' had a black band raand his hat which coom in varry weel to cover up th' grease spots an' one neet as they wor gooin hooam together he screwed up his courage an' ax'd her if shoo didn't think as shoo wor soa lonely an' he wor lonely too 'at they'd better join | 'tha'rt to lat ' shoo sed 'for aw joined long sin an' wor made a member directly after aw burrid awr poor jack '| 'but that isn't what aw mean ' sed tommy 'aw mean hadn't we better join an' get wed for awm sure we could get on varry nicely together '| 'well aw think we can get on varry nicely separate ' shoo sed 'but anyway if iver aw do get wed agean it'll have to be a member o'th' chapel for awr jack deead an' gooan as he is an' ther wor niver a better chap teed to a woman nor he wor yet he had his faults an' he knew a deeal moor abaat sausages an' puddins nor he knew abaat sarmons an' prayers an' he'd rayther ha gooan to a dog feight nor a deacons' meetin ony day an' as he left me varry nicely provided for though aw've nubdy to thank for that but misen aw can affoord to wait wol aw get suited '| 'well hannah maria ' he sed 'but suppoas aw wor a deacon do yo think aw should suit '| 'that aw connot tell ' shoo sed 'but if tha iver gets to be a deacon tha can ax me then '| soa tommy bade her gooid neet an' nah he wor detarmined to be a deacon come what wod | next sunday he joined th' sunday schooil as a taicher tho' he knew noa moor abaat taichin nor th' powl 'at hung o' th' aghtside ov his shop door | then he tuk a sittin in a pew reight anent th' parson tho' he had to pay well for it an' when they made a collection which wor pratty oft an' th' chaps used to goa raand wi' th' box allus when they wor singin th' last hymn he used to be soa takken up wi' th' singin wol th' chap had to nudge him two or three times then he'd throw daan his book an' fidget in his pocket as if he'd forgetten all abaat it an' bring aght sixpenoth ov hawpneys an' put 'em in wi' sich a rattle wol ivery body'd knew 'at he'd gien summat | he wor allus th' furst in his seeat an' one o'th' last to leeav an' ivery sunday he managed to have summat to say awther to th' parson or one o'th' deacon's wol befoor he'd been thear a month he'd getten to be quite a nooated chap | wheniver one o'th' congregation called in to get shaved they allus faand him readin th' evangelical magazine or else repooarts o'th' liberation society an' it worn't long befoor sombdy tell'd him in a saycret 'at he wor baan to be propoased for a deacon | he tried to luk as if he cared nowt abaat it but as sooin as the chap went aght he flang his lather brush under th' table threw his razor an' white appron into a corner upset his lather box on to th' evangelical an' ran up stairs two steps at a time an' seized a bottle off th' shelf an' sayin 'here's to th' deacon '| swallowed hauf a pint o' neat an' what else he might ha done aw dooant know if he hadn't ommost brokken his neck wi' tryin to turn a summerset | this browt him to his senses a bit an' then he sat daan to reckon up ha mich a wick he'd have comin in when he'd getten wed to th' widder | nah aw hardly like to say it but it's true tommy wor rayther fond ov a drop o' summat strong but he niver let monny fowk see him tak it after he'd joined th' chapel | but he had just one confidential friend an' he allus tell'd him iverything an' ov coarse he'd let him know all abaat th' widder an' being made a deacon soa he sent for him an' they'd a fine time on it that neet for they shut up th' shop an' gate as full as they could carry an' just as they wor gooin to pairt a letter coom to tell tommy 'at he'd to be voted for as a deacon after th' thursday's meetin an' as that day wor tuesday they hadn't long to wait soa they detarmined to have another glass or two on th' heead on it an' they kept it up soa long wol at last they both fell asleep | when they wakkened it wor broad dayleet an' they felt rayther seedy soa they agreed to separate an' tommy made his friend promise to be sure to call on him to tak him to th' meetin | alick promised an' then left him | nah alick wor a man ov his word soa he decided net to goa hooam for fear o' forgettin but he hadn't been sat long i'th' 'tattered rag tap ' befoor he fell asleep' 'when he wakken'd it wor cloise on six o' clock an' th' furst thowt 'at struck him wor 'at that wor th' time for th' meetin for he didn't think 'at it worn't wol the day after soa swallowin daan another stiff glass o' rum he set off to fotch tommy | when he gate thear he saw tommy sittin nursin his heead an' lukkin as sanctimonious as if he'd niver done owt wrang in his life | 'come on '| he sed 'if tha doesn't luk sharp tha'll be to lat '| 'what does ta mean alick ' he sed 'th' meetin isn't till to morn at neet '| 'aw tell thi it's to neet an' it's time tha wor thear nah | aw promised tha should be i' time an' tha'll ha to goa '| 'aw tell th' meetin isn't wol thursday '| 'well this is thursday '| 'tha'rt drunk alick tha doesn't know what tha'rt talking abaat '| alick wor just drunk enuff to have his own rooad an' wodn't listen to reason soa he says 'awl let thi see who it is 'at's druffen | awl awther ha thee made a deacon or a deead en afoor tha gooas to bed to neet '| an' sayin soa he seized hold on him an' tuckin him under his arm as if he'd been a umbereller he started off aght o' door | tommy begged an' prayed an' kicked an' fittered but all to noa use | alick wor three times as big as him an' held him like a vice | just as they'd getten into th' street they met all th' miln fowk an' as they wor booath weel known fowk laffed rarely for they thowt it a gooid spree | th' rooads wor varry mucky an' sloppy an' as alick worn't varry steady on his pins they hadn't gooan far befoor they wor booath rollin i'th' sludge but alick niver left goa he scramel'd up an' off agean an' wor varry sooin at th' chapel door | th' only consolation 'at poor tommy had wor thinkin 'at th' chapel wodn't be oppen an' then alick wod find aght his mistak but it unfortunately happened' at ther wor a meetin that neet i'th vestry abaat establishing a band o' hope soa th' chapel doors wor oppen | alick rushed in wi' poor tommy moor deead nor alive | th' noise they made sooin browt all th' fowk aght o'th' vestry an' th' parson coom fussin to see what wor to do an' as ther wor nobbut one or two leets i'th' chapel bottom an' nooan up stairs he could hardly see what it all meant | just then alick let goa an' tommy flew up stairs like a shot hooapin 'at as it wor ommost dark he'd be able to find his way aghtside befoor he wor seen | alick luk'd varry solid an' tried to balance hissen by holdin to one o'th' gas fixtures | 'what's the meaning of this '| sed th' parson | 'please yor reverence hic aw've browt yo th' new deacon hic an' a d l ov a job aw've had to mak him come but awm a man o' mi word an' aw promised he should bi here i' time an' aw'd ha browt him if aw'd had to being him in his coffin | that's th' sooart ov chap aw am old cock '| bi this time all th' fowk wor gethered raand an' th' parson luk'd throo one to another to see if they could explain matters but they wor all fast amang it | alick wor standin lukkin raand in a sackless sooart ov a way when all at once he spied th' widder amang 'em soa ponitin her aght he sed 'jack's widder thear can tell yo all abaat it it's been made up between them two an' a varry gooid pair they'll mak an' if he cannot shave her shoo'll be able to lather him | tha knows awm a man o' mi word hannah maria an' aw sed aw'd bring him '| all th' nooatice th' widder tuk wor to shak her neive in his face an' as they all could see ha drunk alick wor they left him standin wol they locked all th' doors an' prepared to have a hunt for th' chap 'at had run up stairs | but tommy wor detarmined net to be catched if he could help' it an' a fine race he led' em for he flew ovver th' pews like a cat an' as th' door keeper an' pew oppener an' th' parson ran after him th' wimmen kept gettin into ther rooad an' ovver they tummeld knockin th' cannels aght as they fell an' of all th' skrikin an' screamin yo iver heeard it licked all | alick wor bi hissen daan stairs an' wor feelin rayther misty amahg it but when he heard all th' noise he bethowt him 'at it must be a pairt o'th' ceremony an' he began to feel excited | 'keep it up owd lad | gooid lad tommy | thar't a cock burd | by gow i tha niver should ha been a barber | two hauf craans to one on th' little en '| but they catched him at last an' as they didn't know who it wor an' he wor soa covered wi' muck an dust wol it wor hard to tell they browt him daan stairs whear ther wor a better leet | when th' parson saw who it wor he could hardly believe his een an' all t' others put ther hands as if they thowt th' roof worn't safe | 'thomas ' sed th' parson solemnly 'i'm sorry to see thou hast fallen | thy race here is run '| 'well he ran weel didn't he '| sed alick | ther wor moor nor him fell i' that race or else ther wor a deeal o' skrikin for nowt | but it just suits me aw wodn't ha missed it for a shillin | aw wor niver at th' makkin ov a deacon afoor it's three times as mich fun as makkin a free mason '| tommy tried to spaik but he wor soa aght o' wind wol he couldn't say a word an' as sooin as th' doors wor oppened he made a bolt for hooam | alick follerd him but fan th' door locked soa he went hooam too | next mornin nawt her on 'em could exactly tell what had happened th' neet afoor but alick went to pay tommy a visit | what wor sed aw dooant know but they tell me 'at alick's shaved hissen iver sin for he doesn't seem to like th' idea o' tommy bein soa varry near him wi' a razor | ov course tommy worn't made a deacon an' what wor war nor all he lost th' widder into th' bargain | they did try to get him to join th' good templars an' alick sed if he wanted to be a member he'd promise to see' at he wor thear i' time if he had to sit up another neet for it 'an tha knows awm a man o' mi word doesn't ta tommy '| but someha or other tommy seems content to stop as he is but if yo should iver give him a call aw wodn't advise yo to say owt abaat him bein made deacon for th' thowts on it seems to be like th' black pudding he had at th' burrin drinkin varry heavy on his stummack an' all th' gin an' watter he's been able to get has niver swilled it daan | hannah maria's getten wed agean shoo wor as gooid as her word shoo wed a local praicher but as his labours didn't seem to profit him mich he left th' connexion an' wi' hannah maria's bit o' brass he bowt th' valiation o'th 'purrin pussycat' public haase an' shoo tends th' bar wi' as mich red ribbon flyin raand her heead as ud mak reins for a six horse team | tommy called once but when he saw th' picture frame 'at he'd taen soa mich pains wi' for jack's funeral card hung up wi' a ticket in it sayin 'prime pop ' he supt up his rum an' walked sorrowfully aght withaat payin for it an' he's niver been seen thear sin | one amang th' rest | i cannot say that the birth of sally green was heralded with many joyful anticipations | her father was one of those unfortunate men who have never had any trade taught to them and his income always small was also very precarious | one day you might find him distributing circulars another acting as porter at times he got a stray job as gardener and was always willing to undertake almost any thing by which to earn an honest penny | his wife had for many years been a sickly woman yet she was fruitful as was proved by the six children who with laughter or tears as the case might be welcomed their father home |  old tip as he was familiarly called both at home and abroad was sitting opposite the fire smoking an old clay pipe when the news was brought that little sally was born and both mother and babe were doing well | he answered simply ho |  an' is that all tha has to say when tha's getten another dowter an' one o' th' grandest childer aw think' at wor iver born |  well what am aw to say | it's all reight isn't it | shoo'll be one amang th' rest | although tip appeared to treat the event with such indifference yet his mind was ill at ease for he well knew that his scanty means had barely sufficed to find food for those dependent upon him before time and an additional mouth to provide for was by no means a thing to be desired | there is an old saying that god never sends a mouth without sending something to put in it and that is very true but it is just possible that the food sent to put in it is appropriated to some other mouth that has already got above its share | if this was not so we should be spared the pain of reading the heartrending accounts that are so frequently brought under our notice of people being starved to death | it is not my intention to detail all the little incidents connected with sally's early years suffice it to say that she was dragged up somehow along with her brothers and sisters who as they got older and able to work and earn a wage sufficient to support themselves left one by one to depend upon their own exertions but never once giving a thought to the debt of gratitude they owed to those who had laboured so long and endured so many troubles for their sakes | in time sally was old enough to be put to some business and as she had all along been of a weaker constitution than her sisters it was deemed advisable to select some occupation for her of a lighter description | accordingly she soon found herself placed with a shopkeeper in the town to learn the mysteries of concocting bonnets caps c the money she received at the commencement was very little but doubtless was a just equivalent for her labours but her parents whose income had decreased with their increasing years had often to suffer privations in order to dress sally as became her position | sally was naturally quick of apprehension and the old folks' hearts were often cheered by the reports of her advancement |  it maks me thankful monny a time i'th' day tip to think ha sally taks to her wark an' tha sees shoo's soa steady an' niver braiks ony time an' aw connot help thinkin 'at may be shoo'll net only be a comfort to us in old age but a varry gurt help |  shoo's steady enough said tip but aw dooant think its wise to build ony castles i'th' air abaat her helpin us mich | th' kitten seldom brings th' old cat a maase | nooan o' th' brothers has iver done owt for us net 'at aw want owt net aw but aw know 'at we've had to do a deeal for them an' it luks rayther hard at they should niver think abaat payin a trifle back an' awm feeared sally 'll be one amang th' rest |  happen net | tha wor allus fond o' lukkin o'th' dark side |  aw may weel be fond o' lukkin at it for awve seen varry little o'th' breet en | sally continued to progress and her employer was not slow to recognize her abilities and increase her wages in proportion | she often indulged in dreams of what she would do for her parents as soon as she was able but as yet her own wants were so very pressing that it took all her money to satisfy them | she saw and admired her fellow workers as they entered or left the place of business dressed in such clothes as she had never had and such as it must be some time before she could hope to obtain | but she clung to the hope that the time would come and she strained every nerve to hasten its approach | though by no means vain yet it was quite evident sally was aware she was as much her companions' superior in personal attractions as they were her superiors in point of dress and it is to be feared that there were times when she consulted her mirror with exultation and painted in her imagination pictures how she could outshine them all when the time came | by degrees almost imperceptible crept in a dislike to her home not to those who owned it far from it | to her parents she was still loving and dutiful but she began to conceive that her own attempts to improve her appearance her manner of speaking and her general carriage were strangely at variance with her humble home and its belongings | happily those precepts most potent to restrain any waywardness or wickedness had been early instilled into her by her mother whose quiet christian life had been her daily example | her religion was pure and simple and she never failed to impress upon sally the happiness to be derived from an adherence to the truth and a faith in the goodness of god | years rolled on and the slightly built girl was developed into the beautiful woman | she occupied the second position in the work room and her love of dress she was enabled to gratify to its full extent | many a young man lingered about the door of the shop at night in hopes of catching a smile or some mark of encouragement but sally's heart was free respectful to all but showing partiality to none she passed on scathless through many temptations that might have proved too strong for many older than herself | one night a strange event occurred | as she was hurrying home and had arrived within a few yards of the door she stumbled over some object in her path and it was with much difficulty she succeeded in saving herself from an awkward fall | it was too dark to see what the object was but she ran into the house acquainted her parents with the event and accompanied by them bearing a light she returned to see what the obstacle was | across the pavement was laid a young man about her own age in a helpless perhaps a dying state |  poor thing | what's th' matter wi' him | sed her mother tip lift him up an' hug him in th' haase an' see what's to do | he's somebody's poor lad | tip was not quite so strong as he had been but he was yet strong enough for the emergency: and lifting up the slim young man he bore him into the house and laid him on the longsettle |  what does ta think is th' matter wi' him | asked the mother is he hurt | noa   why has he had a fit thinks ta |  aw think he has an' it'll be some time befoor he comes aat on it for its a druffen fit |  a'a tha doesn't say soa tip | does ta |  its ten thaasand pities to see him i' that state | sally approached him half in fear and half in anxiety and after scanning his features which in spite of the dirt and the drink were yet handsome she turned to her father and asked what shall we do with him |  we shall be like to tak care on him lass wol he sleeps it off aw expect for we connot turn him aat an' if we did th' police wod lock him up | awve suffered a deeal i' mi lifetime wi' my lads but awve niver seen one on 'em i' that state an' awd rayther follow 'em to th' grave nor iver do it | for hours they sat beside the sleeping man and when it was far past their usual time of retiring to rest they looked at each other mutely asking what would be best to do |  father and mother said sally it is time you went to bed i know you cannot bear to miss your accustomed rest | i will watch by this young man until he awakes and so soon as he is fit to leave the house he shall do so and then i can get an hour's sleep before the shop opens in the morning i do not think he will sleep long now | the old couple did not like to leave her sitting up but seeing no reason why they too should watch they left her with their blessing and retired to rest | the light from the candle fell full on the face of the sleeper and although sally often tried to read one of her favourite books yet as oft she found her eyes rivetted upon the countenance of the man before her | at times he moaned as though in pain again he smiled a sweet sweet smile so innocent and childlike as if no care had ever crossed his path then a deep deep sigh heaved his breast as though all hope had died within it | sally leaned over him and tears rolled down her cheeks as she gazed on him and with her hand she gently parted his curly locks exposing a brow that rivalled her own for whiteness | she was thus occupied when his eyes slowly opened and she started back | he looked around him with a listlessness that showed the stupor had not yet worn off | presently he aroused himself and in a husky voice asked where am i |  you are in the house of those who have endeavoured to befriend you she replied you are quite safe perhaps you had better try to sleep again | no sleep no  let me have something to drink i bring me some beer i'm choaking |  that i cannot do and would not if i could but here is some tea made nice and warm that will do you much more good | and as she said this she handed him the jug | he took it from her with a half amused half astonished expression on his face and drank the contents at a draught |  there there | he muttered and reseated himself | he looked for a short time at sally as she sat opposite him but there was such an air of dignity mingled with compassion imprinted on her face that it was only after one or two ineffectual attempts that he could articulate another word | at length he said will you kindly tell me miss where i am and how i came here |  you are in my father's house in street and he carried you here | i stumbled over something on my way home and on going back with my parents we found you laid helpless on the pavement | they have gone to bed and i am waiting until you feel able to resume your walk home |  it must have been quite evident to you that i was in liquor and i must have caused you great inconvenience | i did not think there was a person in the world who would have taken so much trouble on my behalf but i am glad to say that i am in a position to pay for it and you are at liberty to help yourself saying which he threw a wellfilled purse upon the table |  i beg that you will replace the purse in your pocket sir | to any kindness you have received you are welcome and you would only insult my parents by offering to pay |  not a very enviable looking home he muttered but it seems pride can dwell in a cottage |  just pride can dwell in the cottage as well as in the mansion i hope she replied rising to open the door |  the morning is cold yet fine she said and as you are doubtless expected home it may be advisable not to delay your departure |  i will act upon your hint he said but i have one favour yet to ask will you grant it |  that depends upon the nature of it |  it is that i may be allowed to call here again to express the gratitude i feel for the kind manner in which you have acted towards me | at present i am not in a fit state to do so | will you grant me that privilege |  we do not seek for your thanks sir you are a perfect stranger to us and we have but done that which we felt it our duty to do but if it will afford you any pleasure i am quite sure my father will grant your request | with a hasty good morning he hurried off passing through the quiet streets as quickly as he could still wondering how he had got into such strange company | sally sought her bed to snatch a few hours of sleep but all desire seemed to have flown | she could think of nothing but the young man's face as she had seen him as he slept | his dress and manners bespoke the gentleman but he had left no name and she vainly endeavoured to discover who he was | the next day brought the young man once more to the cottage door but in a very different state | sally was not at home but the old woman invited him forward and requested him to be seated |  give my best thanks to your daughter he said as they conversed together and tell her i shall be for ever grateful to her for she has proved as good as she is beautiful and she is beautiful |  ther's lots o' nice young wimmen ith' world said tip an shoo's one amang th' rest | after sitting for a few minutes whilst the old woman warned him of the danger he placed himself in by giving way to such evil habits and having promised never again to forget himself so far he shook hands with the worthy couple and departed leaving behind him a handsome sum of money unknown to them | not long after sally was returning home when she met the same young man | the recognition was mutual and he at once joined her and strolled along by her side pouring forth his thanks for her kindness and begging that she would not look upon him with disgust on account of the unfavourable circumstances under which their first meeting took place | his manners were so easy and his conversation so entertaining that they reached the end of the street in which she lived almost before she was aware | he bade her good night and struck off in an opposite direction | sally's heart palpitated more quickly than usual as she entered the house and for some reason unknown even to herself she did not acquaint her parents with the interview | she endeavoured to occupy her mind by busying herself with the little household affairs but her manner was abstracted so feigning exhaustion she went to her room at an earlier hour than usual | she slept but not that deep quiet undisturbed slumber that wraps in oblivion all the senses | she dreamed strange dreams in which she saw strange faces but the one face was ever there and in the morning she arose feverish and unrefreshed | chapter ii | some months had elapsed since sally's first interview with young arthur grafton for such his name proved to be and during that time matters had assumed a very different character | one or two meetings seemingly accidental led to an intimacy growing between them which was not easily to be mistaken | arthur was a young man possessing great advantages not only in personal attractions but as the possessor of an ample fortune | his father had been dead many years and his mother resided in the neighbourhood of london | no sooner however did arthur attain his majority and find himself in such a favoured position than he gave way to those excesses which are generally somewhat lightly styled youthful indiscretions | his mother had done all that lay in her to prevail upon him to alter his course of conduct but he being headstrong yet affectionate and not wishing to cause her pain at the same time being disinclined to follow her advice left home in order to be free from all restraint | thus it happened that he was spending a porportion of his time in y | sally's parents were not blind to the state of their daughter's feelings towards arthur but they were full of fear | once or twice he had called at the cottage and they had marked the unnatural sparkle of his eye that told of a too great indulgence in drink | on one or two occasions he had openly scoffed at religion and treated as jests things they held to be most sacred | they often spoke to sally and warned her but her usual reply was a light laugh or an assurance that she knew what she was doing | little by little she ceased to think there was anything very wrong in a young man becoming intoxicated if he only did it occasionally | her attendance at church was not so regular and in a short time it ceased altogether and she looked forward to the sabbath only as a day of recreation and one on which she could spend more time with him who was day by day leading her farther from the path of duty | many a friend warned her of her danger but her whole soul had become so wrapped up in him that his very vices appeared as virtues in her eyes | sally had not forgotten her early teachings and many a night when all was hushed the still small voice of conscience whispered 'beware beware ' but she would not listen to it she had set her heart upon him and although she could not but admit he had many faults yet she strove to believe that she had the power to wean him from his evil ways | one night the old couple and their daughter were sat by their cheerful fire | tip as was his wont smoking his pipe the old woman bending over the oft consulted bible and sally with her elbow resting upon the table and her head leaned upon her hand gazing at the kitten sleeping on the hearth although she saw it note arthur had failed to keep his appointment and she was sad in consequence | a loud knock at the door disturbed them sally hastened to open it and arthur in a state of wild intoxication rushed in | even sally shuddered and shrank from his attempted caresses | her mother shook her head and looking upward seemed to implore help from him of whose death she had just been reading: whilst old tip rose to his feet took the pipe from his mouth and angrily pointed towards the door | drunk as arthur was he comprehended his meaning but advancing towards him with uncertain gait he placed a hand upon each shoulder and forced him back into his seat uttering a fearful oath | sally strove to quiet him and implored her father to excuse him at the same time begging of arthur to leave the house | the consternation and excitement of those about him seemed to add fuel to the fire already within him and tearing the bible from the old woman's lap he hurled it on the fire | tip rushed to save it but arthur seized the poker and stood threatening death to any who dared to touch it | tip undaunted made another effort | the dreadful weapon fell upon his unprotected head and in another instant he was stretched upon the floor | the sight of poor tip in such a state together with the wailing and weeping of sally and her mother seemed to have the effect of sobering him a little he threw down the poker opened the door and without a word passed out | chapter iii | a bright spring morning succeeded the night on which the commotion had taken place in tip's usually quiet home | he was stirring about the house as was his custom a bandage over his brow being the only indication of the recent unpleasant event | the wound was not a dangerous one and the unceasing attention of his daughter had enabled him to rally much sooner than might have been expected | sally and her mother were also bustling about | not a word escaped from any of them in reference to what had taken place | old tip looked more than usually morose the mother more than usually sorrowful and sally's brow was contracted and her lips compressed and her eyes spoke of fixed determination | she dressed herself with more than usual care and lingered over many little things before she bade her usual good morning and when she closed the door she gazed a moment at the old familiar structure wiped the tears from her eyes that in spite or all she could do would come to testify that her heart was not so callous as she fain would make it appear and then she walked rapidly away but not to her work |no  she sought the home of him who had come like a blight on their domestic peace | she carried with her no feeling of resentment her heart was full of love and compassion | she had undergone a dreadful struggle | the climax had arrived | she must choose between her parents and her lover | it was a hard hard task but it was over | house and parents all that had been associated with her early and happy years sacrificed for one whose past life had brought to her so much misery | she reached the door rang the bell and was ushered into the room in which arthur sat vainly endeavouring to recall the circumstances of the preceding night | he was pleased yet astonished to see her and they were quickly engaged in an earnest and hurried conversation | in a few minutes arthur rang the bell and gave orders for all his boxes to be packed and conveyed to the nearest railway station | he called for his bill which he discharged with alacrity a hired carriage was at the door arthur and sally entered it and she returned home no more | the grief of her parents was very great when they knew that she had left them and they anxiously waited for some tidings of her whereabouts but no tidings came | for a time remittances of money came regularly but these suddenly stopped and their only means of subsistence was gone | the articles of furniture were disposed of one by one to supply the cravings of appetite but they were soon exhausted and one morning saw them placed in a cart and taken to the workhouse | they had both been gradually sinking since sally's flight and it was but a short time after the removal from their home that the parish hearse removed them to the last home of all flesh in this world | the fact of their ever having existed seemed to be almost forgotten when a painful tragedy revived it in the minds of those who had known them | when newspapers gave the distressing account of a young woman having leaped from london bridge into the river bearing in her arms a little babe | they were taken out quite dead and on being searched a piece of paper with the following words written upon it was all that was found | 'let my dreadful fate be a warning to the young | i was young and beautiful i became proud and ambitious i ceased to lend an ear to the kind counsel of my parents i ceased to look upon sin with abhorence i sought pleasure in iniquity the torments of hell can be no worse than those i have endured my seducer lives to make other victims my babe dies with me lest it should ever live to know its parent's shame i go to meet my god a murderess and a suicide | my only hope is in his unbounded mercy and the intercession of his son | sally green | reader does not this little story teach a moral | i think it does | be not proud of the personal attractions with which nature has blessed you | shun evil company obey your parents and fear god always | sally green's case is not an isolated one | there are thousands at the present moment who are pressing on in the same path that terminated so dreadfully for her | watch and pray lest it should be your unhappy lot to be described in old tip's expressive words as 'one amang th' rest '| what's yor hurry | ther's nowt done weel 'ud's done in a

is a great honour that he should think of you now | elfric followed the messenger who led him into the interior of the palace where he found edwy impatiently awaiting him in the royal dressing chamber | elfric had expected to find the newly crowned king deeply impressed but if such had been the case at the moment it had passed away |  thanks to all the saints including st george and especially the dragon that i can look into your jolly face again elfric it is a relief after all the grim beards who have surrounded me today | i shudder when i think of them | elfric had been about to kneel and kiss the royal hand in token of homage but edwy saw the intention and prohibited him |  no more of that an thou lovest me elfric my poor hand is almost worn out already |  the day must have tired you the scene was so exciting | edwy yawned as he replied thank god it is over i thought odo was going to preach to me all day and the incense almost stifled me the one good thing is that it is done now and all england kent sussex wessex essex northumbria east anglia and mercia have all acknowledged me as their liege lord the basileus of britain | what is done can't be undone and dunstan may eat his leek now and go to fight satan again | elfric looked up in some surprise |  what do you think my friend who do you suppose is here in the palace in the royal apartments | who   elgiva the fair elgiva the lovely elgiva dear elgiva and her mother | oh but i shall love to look upon her face when the feast is done and the grim beards have gone |  but dunstan |  dunstan may go and hang himself he can't scrape off the consecrated oil or carry away crown bracelet and sceptre to hide with the other royal treasures at glastonbury but the feast is beginning and you must come and sit on my right hand |  no no said elfric who saw at once what an impropriety this would be not yet besides my old father is here and has kept a seat beside himself for me |  well goodbye for the present i shall expect you after the feast | elgiva will be glad to see you | elfric returned to his father but a feeling of sadness had taken possession of him an apprehension of coming evil | the feast began the clergy and the nobility of the land were assembled in the great hail of the palace and there was that profusion of good cheer which befitted the day for the english were like their german ancestors in the habit of considering the feast an essential part of any solemnity | how much was eaten and drunk upon the occasion it would be dangerous to say for it would probably exceed all modern experience but it seemed to the impatient edwy that the feast and the subsequent drinking of pledges and healths would never end and he was impatient the whole time to get away and be in the company of the charmer | an opportunity seemed at last to offer itself to his immature judgment | gleemen had sung harpers had harped but the excitement culminated when siward a northumbrian noble who was a great musician and skilful in improvisation did not disdain like the royal alfred to take the harp and pour forth an extemporary ode of great beauty whereupon the whole multitude rose to their feet and waved their wine cups in the air in ardent appreciation of the patriotic sentiments he had uttered and the beauty of the music and poetry | during the full din of their heated applause when all eyes were fixed upon the accomplished musician edwy rose softly from his chair a door was just behind him and he took advantage of it to leave the hail and thread the passages quickly till he came to the room where he had left elgiva when he threw aside his royal mantle and all his restraint at the same time | it was not for a few moments that the company in the hall discovered the absence of their king but when they did there was a sudden hush and men looked at each other in mute astonishment it appeared to all with scarce an exception a gross insult to the assembled majesty of the nation |  xiii poor edwy in his thoughtlessness and want of proper feeling little knew the deep anger such a proceeding would cause in his lack of a reverential spirit he was constantly as we have seen offending against the respect due to the church the state or himself first as heir presumptive then as king | men stood mute as we have said then murmurs of indignation at the slight arose and all looked at dunstan | he beckoned to cynesige of lichfield who came to his side |  we must bring this thoughtless boy back he said or great harm will be done |  but how |  by persuasion if possible | follow me | the two prelates entered the interior of the palace and sought the king's private chamber | as they drew near they heard the sound of merry laughter and each of them frowned as men might do who were little accustomed to condone the weakness of human flesh | entering the chamber very unceremoniously they paused as if aghast when they beheld the king in the company of elgiva his royal diadem cast upon the ground | he started in surprise and for a moment in fear then remembering who he was he exclaimed angrily how dare you sir monk intrude upon the privacy of your king unbidden |  we do so as the ambassadors of the king of kings | it is out of our power to describe the scene which followed the fiery words of edwy the stern yet quiet rejoinders of the churchmen the tears of the mother and daughter but it is well known how the scene ended | edwy absolutely refused to return to the assembled guests saying he would forfeit his kingdom first and dunstan replied that for his edwy's own sake he should then be compelled to use force and suiting the action to the word he and cynesige took each an arm of the youthful king and led him back by compulsion to the assembled nobles and clergy | before condemning dunstan we must remember that elgiva could not stand in the relation of the affianced bride of the king that edwy really seemed to set the laws of both church and state at defiance those very laws which but that day he had sworn solemnly to maintain and that but recently he had stood in the relation of pupil to dunstan so that in his zeal for church and state the abbot forgot the respect due to the king | he saw only the boy and forgot the sovereign | the guests assembled in the banqueting hall had seen the desertion of their royal master with murmurs both loud and deep but when they saw him return escorted by dunstan and cynesige their unanimous approval showed that in their eyes the churchmen had taken a proper step | yet although edwy tried to make a show of having returned of his own free will an innocent device at which his captors connived when they entered the hall with him the bitterest passions were rankling in his heart and he determined to take a terrible revenge should it ever be in his power upon dunstan | there was comparatively little show of merriment during the rest of the feast and the noble company separated earlier than was usual on such occasions |  if this be the way king edwy treats his guests said the earl of mercia he will find scant loyalty north of the thames |  nor in east anglia said another |  there is another of the line of cerdic living |  yes edgar his brother |  dunstan and cynesige brought him back with some difficulty i'll be bound |  yes although he tried to smile i saw the black frown hidden beneath |  he will take revenge for all this |  upon whom |  why upon dunstan to be sure |  but how can he | dunstan is too powerful for that |  wait and see | such was the general tone of the conversation from which the sentiments of the community might be inferred | elfric went as he had been bidden to do at the conclusion of the feast to seek edwy and found him it is needless to state in a towering rage |  elfric he said am i a king | or did i dream i was crowned today |  you certainly were |  and yet these insolent monks have dared to force me from the company of elgiva to return to that sottish feast and what is worse i find they have dared to send her and her mother home under an escort so that i cannot even apologise to them | as i live if i am a king i will have revenge |  i trust so indeed said elfric they deserve death |  i would it were in my power to inflict it but this accursed monk i go mad when i mention his name is all too powerful | i believe satan helps him |  still there may be ways if you only wait till you can look around you |  there may indeed |  only have patience all will be in your hands some day |  and if it be in my power i will restore the worship of woden and thor and burn every monk's nest in the land |  they were at least the gods of warriors |  elfric you will stand by me will you not |  with my life |  come to the window now see the old sots departing | there a priest there a thane there an earl all drunk i do believe don't you think so |  yes yes said elfric disregarding the testimony of both his eyes that they were all perfectly sober | just then his eye caught a very disagreeable object and he turned somewhat pale |  what are you looking at | said edwy |  there is that old fox dunstan talking with my father he will learn that i am here |  what does it matter |  only that he will easily persuade my father to take me home |  then the commands of a king must outweigh those of a father | i have heard dunstan say a king is the father of all his people and i command you to stay |  i want to stay with all my heart |  then you shall even if i have to make a pretence of detaining you by force | the anticipations of elfric were not far wrong | dunstan had found out the truth | he had sought out the old thane to condole with him upon the pain he supposed he must recently have inflicted by his letter |  i cannot express to you my old friend and brother he said the great pain with which i sent your poor boy elfric home but it was a necessity |  sent him home | said ella |  yes at the time our lamented edred died |  sent him home | repeated ella in such undisguised amazement that dunstan soon perceived something was amiss and in a few short minutes became possessed of the whole facts while ella learnt his son's disgrace | they conferred long and earnestly | the father's heart was sorely wounded but he could not think that elfric would resist his commands and he promised to take him back at once to aescendune where he hoped all would soon be well soon very soon he said falteringly | so the old thane went to his lodgings hard by the palace where he awaited his son | late in the evening elfric arrived his countenance flushed with wine: he had been seeking courage for the part he had to play in the wine cup | long and painful most painful was the interview that followed | hardened in his rebellion the unhappy elfric defied his father's authority and justified his sin flatly refusing to return home in which he pretended to be justified by the duty a subject owed to his sovereign | thus roused to energy ella solemnly adjured his boy to remember the story of his uncle oswald and the sad fate he had met with | it was very seldom indeed that ella alluded to his unhappy brother the story was too painful but now that elfric seemed to be commencing a similar course of disobedience the example of the miserable outlaw came too forcibly to his mind to be altogether suppressed |  beware my son added ella lest the curse which fell upon oswald fall upon you and your younger brother succeed to your inheritance |  it is not a large one said elfric and in that case the king whom i serve will find me a better one |  is it not written 'put not your trust in princes '| o my son my son you will bring my grey hairs with sorrow to the grave | it was of no avail | the old thane arose in the morning with the intention of taking elfric home even by force such force as dunstan had used if necessary but found that the youth had disappeared in the night neither could he learn what had become of him but he shrewdly guessed that the young king could have told him | broken hearted by his son's cruel desertion the thane of aescendune returned home alone | chapter ix | glastonbury abbey | rich in historical associations and reputed sanctity the abbey of glastonbury was the ecclesiastical centre of western england | here grew the holy thorn which joseph of arimathea had planted when fatigued with travel he had struck his staff into the ground and lo | a goodly tree here was the holy well of which he had drunk and where he baptized his converts so that its waters became possessed of miraculous power to heal diseases | here again were memorials dear to the vanquished welsh for did not arthur the great king arthur the hero of a thousand fights the subject of gleeman's melody and of the minstrel's praise lie buried here | if indeed he were dead and not spirited away by magic power | a welsh population still existed around the abbey for it was near the borders of west wales as a large portion of devon and cornwall was then called and exeter had not long become an english town |  xiv the legends of glastonbury were nearly all of that distant day when the saxons and angles had not yet discovered britain and she reposed safe under the protection of mighty rome hence it was the object of pilgrimage and of deep veneration to all those of celtic blood while the english were unwilling to be behind in their veneration | here in the first year of the great english king athelstane dunstan was born the son of herstan and kynedred both persons of rank a man destined to influence the anglo saxon race first in person and then in spirit for generations the greatest man of his time whether as his contemporaries thought mighty for good or as men of narrower minds have thought mighty for evil | in his early youth glastonbury lay as it lies now in ruin and decay the danes had ravaged it and its holy walls were no longer eloquent with prayer and praise | yet the old inhabitants still talked with regret of the departed glories of the fane the pilgrim and the stranger still visited the consecrated well hoping to gain strength from its healing wave for the soil had been hallowed by the blood of martyrs and the holy lives of saints here kings and nobles laying aside their greatness had retired to prepare for the long and endless home and in the calm seclusion of the cloister had found peace | here the mind of the young dunstan was moulded for his future work here weak in body but precocious in intellect he drew in as if with his vital breath legend and tradition here from a body of scottish missionaries or as we should now call them irish xv he learned with rapidity all that a boy could acquire of civil or ecclesiastical lore and both in latin and in theology his progress amazed his tutors | up to this time the world had held possession of his heart and balancing the advantages of a religious and a secular life he chose as most young people would choose the attractions of court to which his parents' rank entitled him and leaving glastonbury he repaired to the court of edmund | nah aw've nooaticed 'at bessy allus blushes when shoo comes to buy owt o' me an' shoo luks onywhear

dear' such was their salutation 'i've come ' sed she 'for much i fear i've got the palpitation '| 'o never mind ' says doctor b 'you need not long endure it just come a little nearer me i fancy i can cure it '| but list to me c he took a loving long embrace cries she 'oh dear that's shocking '| when the doctor's boy to mar their joy just entered without knocking | and when he saw the state o' things then down the stairs he hurried and ran to tell the doctor's wife for doctor b was married | so list to me c the doctor seized his hat and cane and cried 'dear mary hook it '| then down he ran and found a cab and in an instant took it 'drive for your life and fetch my wife and need no second telling '| and in a very little time they reached the doctor's dwelling | so list to me c his wife was there said he 'my dear come with me to the city i'm lonely when you are not near ' says she 'why that's a pity '| he took her to the self same room and in the self same manner he kissed and coaxed his lawful wife as he'd just kissed mary hannah | so list to me c in loving talk some time they spent says she 'now i'll go shopping ' he kissed her and as out she went the doctor's boy came hopping he saw her and he quickly cried 'o please excuse me missus but doctor's got a girl inside and he's smothering her with kisses | so list to me c | 'you little sneaking cur ' she cried 'that shows that you've been peeping '| she boxed his ears from side to side and quickly sent him weeping | the doctor rubbed his hands and smiled to think how well he'd plan'd it and mrs |b  's quite reconciled but

'he's allus ready wi' a speech let's see what he can find to say '| soa one on 'em whistled an' elkanah coom an' they tell'd him what they wanted | 'all reight ' he sed 'but if yor baan to bury it

throo yours truly elkanah '| when he'd done ther wor some moor shaatin an' then one o'th' wimmen sed shoo'd a word or two to say | so he tried to drown his new born pity in wine | at a late hour of the day alfred and his attendants arrived bringing news of the coming succour to father cuthbert and the other friends who awaited him with much anxiety | they had contrived to account for his absence to the lady edith from whom they thought it necessary to hide the true state of affairs | but everything tended to increase alfred's feverish anxiety about his brother | the relieving force could not arrive for hours meanwhile he knew not what to do | no tidings were heard: father swithin had failed and elfric might perhaps even now be dead | so alfred taking counsel only of his own brave loving heart left the priory in the dusk attended by the faithful oswy and walked towards his former home | the night was dark and cloudy the moon had not yet arisen and they were close upon the hall ere they saw its form looming though the darkness | neither spoke but they paused before the drawbridge and listened | sounds of uproarious mirth arose from within danish war songs shouting and cheering the whole body of the invaders were evidently feasting and revelling with that excess of which in their leisure moments they were so capable |  it is well | said alfred and they walked round the exterior of the moat marking the brightly lighted hall and the unguarded look of the place yet not wholly unguarded for they saw the figure of a man outlined against a bright patch of sky pacing the leaded roof evidently on guard | and now they had reached that portion of their circuit which led them opposite the chamber window of the lamented ella and alfred gazed sadly upon it when both he and oswy started as they heard cries and moans and sometimes articulate words proceeding therefrom | they listened eagerly and caught the name dunstan as if uttered in vehement fear then the cry | water  i burn | and cry after cry as if from one in delirium |  it is elfric | it is elfric | said alfred |  it is my young lord's voice said the thrall he is in a fever from his wound |  what can we do | and alfred walked impatiently to and fro at last he stopped | oswy  if it costs me my life i will enter the castle |  it shall cost my life too then | i will live and die with my lord |  come here oswy they do not know the little postern door hidden behind those bushes the passage leads up to the chapel and to the gallery leading to my father's chamber where elfric lies dying | i remember that that door was left unlocked and perhaps i can save him | they are all feasting like hogs they will not know and if ragnar meet me why he or i must die and he put his hand convulsively upon the sword which was dependent from his girdle |  lead on my lord you will find your thrall ready to live or die with you | said oswy | at the extreme angle of the building there was a large quantity of holly bushes which grew out of the soil between the moat and the wall which itself was clothed with the thickest ivy the roof above was slanting an ordinary timber roof covering the chapel so that no sentinel could be overhead | standing on the further side of the moat all this and no more could be observed | the first difficulty was how to cross the moat in the absence of either bridge or boat | it was true they might swim over but in the event of their succeeding in the rescue of elfric how were they to bear him back | the difficulty had to be overcome and they reflected a moment |  there is a small boat down at the ferry whispered oswy | it was all alfred needed and he and oswy at once started for the river | they returned in a few minutes bearing a light boat almost like a british coracle on which they instantly embarked and a push or two with the pole sent them noiselessly across the moat | but if he hadn't a varry heigh opinion o' th' fowk he met yet he worn't withaat pity for 'em an' he generally ended up wi' sayin 'at it wor hardly reight to blame 'em for bein short o' wit when they'd had no orderation on it | but tho' he wor varry liberal wi' his advice ther wor nubdy could charge him wi' bein too liberal wi' his brass for he'd pairt wi' nowt if he could help it yet he'd one waikness in his disposition an' that wor 'at he couldn't say 'noa' if onybody offered to treat him | fowk wodn't ha thowt mich abaat that if it hadn't been for him allus draggin in his friend michael for a share an' it wor weel known 'at michael had nivver existed except in his own imagination | if ivver he gate ax'd to a supper or a bit ova feed o' ony sooart he used to stuff hissen wol he wor foorced to lawse his wayscoit an' then if ther wor owt left he'd say: 'if yo'll excuse me ther's a bit thear 'at aw should like to tak for michael ' an' he used to fill his pockets wi' th' best o' th' stuff an' mony a rare blow aght he gate aght o' what wor supposed to be michael's share | he used to goa to bradforth market two or three times in a wick an' he allus kept his een skinned to luk aght for a bargain an' he didn't care what it wor owt throo a cabbage to a cartwheel if he could turn a penny into three awpence | but he didn't allus mak a gooid spec for strange to say ther wor other fowk 'at wor quite as wise an' even sharper nor hissen | one day he bowt a white bull cauf an' he wor sewer he'd getten it as cheap as muck an' happen he had but haivver cheap yo buy sich a thing it's varry likely to cause yo some bother unless yo've somewhear to put it | it wor a varry weet day an' throo bradford to keighley is a long walk but ther wor nowt else for it unless he tuk it with him on th' train an' that ud be extra expense soa he teed a rooap raand its neck an' they started off | it's an' owd sayin' 'at youth will have its fling ' an' this cauf wor detarmined to goa in for its share | th' rooads worn't i' th' best order yet they mud ha' managed to wade throo but for th' cauf seemin' to have a strong desire to find aght if owd dawdles could swim an' whenivver it coom to a pond or a puddle it gave him a chonce to try but like all young caufs it hadn't mich patience an' th' way it jurk'd him in an' aght worn't varry pleasant for one on 'em | when they'd gooan a mile or two dawdles wor inclined to think it would ha been cheaper to ha taen it bi rail to say nowt abaat th' extra comfort | at ony rate it gave him noa troble to drive it for it seemed to know ivvery step o' th' rooad an' it seem'd a deeal moor like th' cauf takkin dawdles nor him takkin th' cauf | he couldn't help but think 'at it had a deeal moor strength nor sense but altho' he tried to pity it 'coss it hadn't had th' orderation ov it's own heead he couldn't help blamin it for bein soa detarmined to have th' orderation o' th' way they'd to goa | when they'd getten to th' bull's heead he wor ommost finished an' he thowt as he'd getten soa weet aghtside he'd better get a drop in an' as he made towards th' door th' cauf went an' backed into th' passage an' wodn't let him enter a yard | he tried his best to get it to stir but all to noa use | wol he wor tewin with it th' landlord wor scalin th' foir i' th' kitchen an' he thowt he heard sumdy makkin a noise an' he went to see an' when he saw dawdles tryin to pool th' cauf aght o' th' passage he thowt he'd help him soa he gave it a prod behind wi' th' foir point an' it flew aght o' th' door as if it had been shot aght ov a cannon an' its heead happenin to leet i' th' middle o' dawdles' wayscoit he tummeld a backard summerset an' ligged him daan i' th' middle o' th' rooad an' th' cauf laup'd ovver th' wall o' t'other side an' gallop'd away whiskin its tail abaat as if it wanted to cast it | th' landlord went to see dawdles | 'what's ta dooin thear '| he sed | 'aw'm waitin' wol sumdy comes to help me up ' he sed | soa th' landlord helpt him up an' then sed: 'come inside an' sit thi daan a bit '| 'nay lad aw've been i' th' bull's heead monny a time but tha's ommust sent th' bull's heead into me to day | ther's lots o' young caufs come to yor haase beside yond o' mine an' yo've a deeal o' bother wi' 'em sometimes aw know but if yo'll just tickle up wi' th' red wut foir point aw'll bet yo'll get shut on 'em in as little time as yo did that o' mine | all aw wish is 'at tha wor th' cauf an' me th' landlord for five minutes '| 'well tha has dropt in for it pretty rough an' aw think tha's getten aboon thi share tha mun see if tha cannot give a trifle to michael '| dawdles wodn't answer him but set off to catch his white bull cauf an' after chasin it raand for a whole clock haar he gate hold o' th' rooap another time an' they made another start for hooam | it went varry quietly on nah an' th' owd chap thowt it ud be a gooid idea as he wor soa tired an' as ther wor nobody abaat to get astride on it an' have a ride | th' thowt had hardly entered his heead befoor it wor put into practice but if you could ha seen that cauf yo'd ha been fit to split | it stood stock still for abaat a minit an' then it started off gently at furst but it kept gettin faster an' faster wol at last it gate into a two up an' two daan gallop an' dawdles began to find aght 'at altho' veal wor a nice tender soft sooart o' mait when it wor deead it grew on varry hard booans when it wor wick an' he wor twice as anxious to get off an' walk as he had been to get up to ride | he managed to twist th' rooap raand its heead an' he pooled for his life but it didn't mak a bit o' difference | 'wo up | connot ta '| he sed 'tha'rt as heeadstrong as tha'rt strong i'th' heead | if ivver aw have th' orderation o' thee agean aw'll bet aw tak some o' that nowtiness aght on thee '| he'd hardly getten th' words aght ov his maath when as they wor passin some pighoils 'at stood o' th' roadside th' cauf made a dash at th' door o' one 'at wor nobbut just heigh enuff for it get in at brast it oppen gooin in an' strippin off dawdles left him sittin i' th' middle o' th' rooad wonderin who'd hit him wi a looad o' bricks | trubbles nivver come singly an' to mak matters war aght rushed a lot o' pigs 'at rolled him ovver an' ovver wol he couldn't tell when he put up his hand whether it wor on his heead or his hat | th' furst thing 'at browt him to his senses wor sumdy shakkin him an' shaatin aght 'what business has ta

mother and the system for all her faults | born as we have said in a boarding house left entirely in charge of the nurse maid educated at a fashionable day school brought into society before fifteen living in the whirl the bustle the luxury and the unhomeliness of a hotel what could you expect of miss flora but that she should be at seventeen years of age a butterfly in her habits a clever dunce as regards solid knowledge and a premature woman of the world in her tastes and manners | the apartments which the briggs family occupy at the fifth avenue hotel are magnificently decorated and furnished but they do not constitute a home | several times mr briggs has offered to purchase a house in a fashionable thoroughfare but his wife objects to the trouble of managing unruly servants and terrifies mr briggs out of the notion by stories of burglars admitted and plate stolen and families murdered in their beds through the connivance of the domestics | what more can any one desire than the briggs family obtain at the hotel for a fixed sum per week and a liberal margin for extras | the apartments are ample and comfortable the cuisine and the wines are irreproachable there is a small table reserved for them to which they can invite whom they choose an immense staff of servants obey their slightest wish their carriages kept at a neighboring livery stable can be sent for at any moment they are as secluded in their own rooms as if they lived in another street so far as the family in the next suite is concerned they are certain to meet everybody and can choose their own company the spacious hotel parlors are at their disposal whenever they wish to give an evening party reception or the dansant | but dawdles wor as gooid as his word an' long befoor it wor done he

awr family dee young but here's a two a three paand aw've managed to save an' it'll happen help to pay some o' thi debts | a few of them are well educated and some of these state that they adopted thieving only when all other means failed them and that they hoped it would keep them from sacrificing their virtue | this hope proved vain and imperceptibly they glided into the latter sin | some of these women live in handsomely furnished private rooms in such localities as bleecker street | others herd together in the lower quarters of the city | the female thief even the most abandoned generally has a husband who is himself a thief or something worse | she takes great pride in being a married woman and whenever she gets into trouble invariably seeks to establish a good character by producing her marriage certificate | even the lowest panel thieves will do this | the female thieves are divided into pick pockets shoplifters and panel thieves |  a short while ago a private detective happened to drop into a large dry goods store in grand street and observed a handsome looking girl about eighteen years old dressed with the best taste pricing laces at a counter | an indefinable expression about her eyes was suspicious and as she left the store without purchasing the spectator followed her to the corner of essex market where walking beside her he noticed something of a square form under her cloak | at once suspecting it to be a stolen card of lace he jostled against her and as he suspected the card of lace fell from under her arm to the sidewalk | she colored and was walking away without picking it up when the detective stopped her said he knew the lace was stolen and that she must return to the shop | she begged of him not to arrest her but restore the lace which he did | after thanking him for not taking her into custody she invited him to call on her and learn the story of her life | she has two rooms in a very respectable locality furnished in the best manner several of prang's chromos are hung on the walls and a piano on which she plays well is in her sitting room | she is very well educated and was driven into her way of life by being left without friends or help and one day stole a shawl without being discovered | emboldened by the success of her first theft she chose shop lifting as her way of life has followed it ever since and was never in prison | some few call her sarah wright but those who know her best style her 'anonyma ' as she dislikes the former title |iv  the river thieves | the harbor thieves constitute one of the most dangerous and active portions of the criminal class | there are only about fifty professional thieves of this class but they give the police a vast amount of trouble and inflict great loss in the aggregate upon the mercantile community | twenty years ago the harbor was infested with a gang of pirates who not only committed the most daring robberies but also added nightly murders to their misdeeds | their victims were thrown into the deep waters of the river or bay and all trace of the foul work was removed | at length however the leaders of the gang saul and howlett by name mere lads both were arrested convicted and executed and for a while a stop was put to the robberies in the harbor but in course of time the infamous trade was resumed but without its old accompaniment of murder | it is at present carried on with great activity in spite of the efforts of the police to put a stop to it | the north river front of the city is troubled with but one gang of these ruffian's which has its headquarters at the foot of charlton street | this front is lined with piers which are well built well lighted and well guarded being occupied chiefly by steamboats plying on the river and by the foreign and coasting steamships | the east river is not so well guarded the piers are dark and the vessels mostly sailing ships are left to the protection of their crews | it is in this river therefore and in the harbor that the principal depredations of the river thieves are carried on |  slaughter house point the intersection of james and south streets and so called by the police because of the many murders which have occurred there is the principal rendezvous of the east river thieves | hook dock at the foot of cherry street is also one of their favorite gathering places | the life of a river thief is a very hard one and his gains as a rule are small | he is subjected to a great deal of manual labor in the effort to secure his plunder and is exposed to all sorts of weather | night work in an open boat in new york harbor is not favorable to longevity and in eight or ten years the most robust constitution will give way before the constant attacks of rheumatism and neuralgia | there would be some compensation to society in this but for the fact that the police whose duty it is to watch the river thieves suffer in a similar way | the river thieves generally work in gangs of three and four | aw once heeard tell ov a young woman at wor a reglar glaid one o' them sooart 'at nubdy could do owt wi' tawk abaat taming a shrew | why net all th' shrews in shrewsbury wor a match for her | but a chap 'at lived net far off thowt shoo wor a varry bonny lass an' he felt sure he could manage her soa he went an' made love in his best fashion an' ivery time shoo call'd him a nasty offald scamp he sed he lov'd hur moor an' moor soa at last shoo cooil'd daan an' all things were made sweet an' befoor long they gate wed | ov coorse they'd a few friends to ther drinkin an' a bit ov a donce at after an' then a drop o' whisky an' hot water an' when th' husband had getten a glass or two into him he began to tell th' cumpany ha he'd tamed hur | 'why ' he sed 'aw can do owt aw like wi' her nah shoo's as gentle as a lamb '| 'if that's thy noation ' shoo says 'th' sooiner tha gets shut on it an' th' better '| soa shoo made noa moor to do but gave him a crack ovver th' nooas wi' her naive an' in abaat a minit it wor swell'd as big as a cauf blether | but when aw wakken'd aw sowt up an' daan but nowhear could aw find th' valentine | nah th' vally ov a thing depends oft o'th' use ov a thing her's an old sayin 'a peck o' march dust is worth a king's ransom ' but aw should think 'at th' vally o'th' ransom owt to depend o'th' vally o'th' king | it's oft capt me ha it is 'at becos one chap is son ov a king an' another is son ov a cart driver 'at one should be soa mich moor thowt on nor tother | noa daat we should all be sons an' dowters o' kings an' queens if we could but then ther'd have to be a deal moor kings an' queens or else they'd niver be able to keep th' stock up | net 'at awm findin fault wi' awr queen net aw marry | shoo's done her best noa daat an' her childer seem tryin to follow her example | but then when princes an' princesses get moor plentyful they'll be less thowt on it'll be th' same wi' them as it wor wi' th' umbrellas at one time for th' chap 'at had th' furst wor run after wi' ivery body an' when ther were nobbut two or three fowk allus ran to th' winder to have a luk at 'em but whoiver runs to luk at umbrellas nah | it wor th' same wi' steam engines it's getten th' same wi' velosipeeds an it'll be th' same wi' princes princesses or owt else as sooin as they get common unless they've summat moor to depend on nor a grand title fowk ull tak but little noatice | we cannot all be fine fowk but we may all be gooid fowk if we try an' a gooid cart driver ull be better nor a bad king at th' finish | rich fowk ha troubles as weel as poor but ther's noa need for onybody to be troubled long for if its summat they can't help its fooilish to freeat an' if its summat they can help why the deuce don't they | its fooilish to freeat but fowk will freeat sometimes | well nivver heed | 'april shaars bring may flowers ' soa we willn't grumel if we get catched i' one nah an' then an' get a gooid sooaking for ther's nowt i'th' world bonnier nor flaars even cauliflaars | ther's lots o' bonny things i'th' world besides flaars ther's bonny words an' if fowk wod nobbut use 'em we should all get on a deeal better | aw remember once bein in a public haase an' ther wor two chaps sat quietly suppin ther pints o' fourpenny when all at once one o' ther wives coom in an her een fair blazed when shoo saw him | 'o soa tha'rt here are ta '| shoo began 'soa this is th' way th' brass gooas is it | tha nasty gooid for nowt | aw could like to smash thi face | sittin thear throo morn to neet sossin like a pig an' leavin me an' th' childer to do as we con | ha con ta fashion | tha desarves teein to a cart tail an' hidin' throo th' streets tha low lived villain | all th' time shoo wor talkin shoo wor shakin her neive in his face an' when he could edge in a word he sed | 'aw'l tell thee what it is this is nobbut mi third pint to day an' aw wor just commin hooam but tha can hook it for aw shall come when aw'm ready an net before an' that will'nt be yet a bit '| just wol they wor fratchin tother chap's wife coom seekin him an' as sooin as shoo saw him shoo smiled an' sed 'o aw've fun thi come lad aw want thee at hooam awr little jack has getten his new clogs on an' he will'nt let me put him to bed till tha's seen 'em tha'll be like to come '| 'howd a minit ' he sed as he emptied his pint then he went away wi' her | tother stopt | soa mich for kindness | an' ther's moor ways nor one o' bein kind | nah yo've oft heeard fowk say 'niver cast a claot till may goas aght '| that's all varry gooid as far as regards top coits an' flannel shirts an sich like | but ther's another thing its just abaat th' time for fowk to get new clooas an' throw off th' old ens an' aw've a word or two to say abaat that for ther's some poor fowk aw see sometimes 'at cannot cast a claot th' fact is they've nowt else to put on | ha monny scoor fowk do we meet as we walk abaat 'ats hardly a rag to ther back or aw should say they've nowt but rags an' that's what prevents 'em havin a chonce to addle brass to buy ony fresh ens | ha monny have to creep aght o'th' seet into ony sooart ov a low hoil mix up wi bad compny first pine then beg then stail an' all this becoss they've had th' misfortun to be ragged | if ther's one thing moor nor another 'at fowk mak a mistak in it's sellin ther old clooas | some may say they can't affoord to give 'em: then aw say wear 'em a bit longer till yo can ther'll somdy be thankful for 'em after then | ivery body can affoord to be charitable to a certain extent an' ther's noa charity does as mich gooid wi as little cost as givin yor old clooas | luk what comfort yo give a chap then as sooin as he sees his sen luk respectable he begins to want to be soa he feels to have moor pluck he doesn't hing daan his heead he's a better chonce to win a honest livin an' yo may safely think yo've gien a chap a lift on his way when yo've gien him yor old clooas | 'if the 8th of june is a rainy day it foretells a wet harvest so men say ' but whether it does or it doesn't aw cannot tell: if it does we mun mak th' best on it that's all but we've one bit o' comfort left even then for its sure to be fair at halifax o'th' 24th | it's grand to goa to th' fair an' see fowk starin at th' pictures an' its cappin to harken to th' show fowk shaatin an' bawlin an' tellin all sooarts o' tales to draw th' brass aght o' yor pockets | then ther's th' swingin booats them's for cooarters: they're a grand institution for young fowk for if a chap can get his young woman to get in he's sure of a chonce to get his arm raand her waist an' give her a bit of a squeeze | then ther's th' flyin' horses whear a chap can get made mazy for a penny: wheniver aw see 'em they allus remind me ov a chap aw knew he stood abaat six foot two in his stockin feet an' weighed abaat six stooan an' a hauf an' one day he'd been poorly a bit soa he thowt he'd ax a friend 'at had a donkey if he'd lend it him | 'tha can have it an' welcome ' th' chap said 'but aw'm feeard thi legs is too long '| 'oh ne'er heed that ' he sed 'if aw find 'em to trail aw'l hold 'em up '| soa he gate it an as he wor varry leet they went on nicely for a bit but just as he wor comin on charlestaan a chap stopt him to ax him what they called that old church soa he dropt daan his feet on to'th floor and began to explain an' as sooin as he'd done that th' donkey walked away leavin him thear striddlin like a clooas peg | as sooin as he'd finished he sed 'gie up '| an he thowt o' sittin daan an' he did but it wor soa mich lower daan wol he thowt his back wor brokken when he luk'd raand he saw neddy trottin up th' haley hill | 'tha's tow't me a lesson ' he sed 'an' for th' futur as long as iver aw can do for misen aw'l niver seek onybody's ass istance | ther's nowt like bein independent an mooast fowk have a chonce if they'll nobbut 'mak hay wol th' sun shines ' an' if yo dooant mak it then yo'll niver be able to mak it at ony other time | if yo want to mak love yo can mak that when th' mooin shines but it will'nt do for hay | aw remember a queer tale 'at they used to tell ov a chap 'at had some strange nooations an' allus thowt his own way best | an' one day as some chaps were gooin past his farm they saw him runnin up an' daan i' th' front o' th' lathe wi' a empty wheelbarro and then rush in an' upset it and aght agean | 'why ' says one 'aw'm sure ike must be crack'd whativer can he be dooin '| soa they went to ax him | 'what's up nah ike '| said one 'tha'll kill thisen if tha gooas on like that are ta trainin for a match or summat '| 'yo dooant know ' sed ike 'but aw'l let yo into a saycret yo see aw'd getten all th' grass cut yesterday an' aw fancied it wor baan to rain soa aw haased it just green as it

business ' says ike 'aw should think aw've lived long enuff to know what aw'm dooin an' when aw want taichin aw'll send for thee '| soa they left him to his wheelin but ha long he kept at it they didn't know but in a few days they saw him agean an' axed him ha he fan his system to answer | an' he says 'why aw dooant get on varry weel but it is'nt th' fault o' th' system th' fact is aw connot do it till aw get a bigger barro | but he wod'nt give in | an' ther's lots o' th' same sooart | perseverance is a grand thing | if it wornt for tewin an' sewin an' plowin whear wod th' harvest be | an

prize winners are | aw allus feel sooary 'at they cannot all win th' furst prize for aw'm sure they desarve it for ther trouble | an' if yo nooatice yo're sure to see a nice cheerful woman or two stood cloise aside o'th' plants 'at's wun owt an' if yo wait a bit yo'll see her ivery nah an' then touch somdy o'th' elbow as they're gooin past an' point at th' ticket an' say 'sithee them's awr's

soa for ther's monny a gooid harvest a' happiness been gethered in at wod ha been lost but for a soft word or two | another old sayin' 'september blow soft till the fruit's i'th' loft ' for if strong

yet | an' its hardly to be wondered at for one hauf o'th' fowk we meet i'th' streets on a neet seem to be druffen | aw hear some queer tales sometimes but aw dooant tell all aw know | 'ale sellers shouldn't be tale tellers '| but aw'm sooary to say at th' mooast ale sellers at' aw know are varry fond o' taletellin | ther's nowt shows a chap's littleness as mich as to be allus talkin abaat his own or somdy else's private affairs an' ther's nowt likely to produce moor bother nor that system o' tittle tattlin abaat other fowk's consarns | ther's a deal o' blame ligg'd o' th' wimmen sometimes for gossipin ovver a sup o' rum an' tea: an' noa daat its true enuff but aw think some o' th' men hav'nt mich room to talk for they gossip as mich ovver ther ale as ivver wimmen do ovver ther tea | little things 'at's sed in a thowtless way sometimes cause noa end o' bother an' it's as weel to be careful for ther's trouble enuff | a chap an' his wife 'at lived neighbors to me had a word or two one neet an' soa shoo went up stairs to sulk an' when he sat daan to his supper he thowt he'd have her on a bit soa he cut all th' mait off a booan an' then he sed to' his oldest lass | 'here mary | tak this up stairs to thi mother an' tell her 'at thi father has sent her a booan to pick '| th' lass tuk it up to her mother an' tell'd her 'at her father'd sent it an' as sooin as shoo saw it shoo says 'tak it him back an' tell him 'at he isn't thi father an' that'll be a booan for him to pick '|  an' it wor an' all an' it's stuck in his throit to this day soa yo see what bother that's caused | it's nivver wise to be rackless naythur i' word nor deed for whativver yo plot an plan agean other fowk it's ommost sewer to roll back on yorsens an' trap yor tooas if it does nowt else 'fowk 'at laik wi' fire mun expect a burn '| an soa all yo 'at intend to keep up gunpaader plot munnot grummel if yo get warmed a bit | but gunpaader plot isn't th' only plot 'at gets browt to a finish this month ther's lots o' plottin an' planin besides that | ther's monny a chap 'at's been langin for a year or two to be made a taan caancillor 'at's been havin all his friends to ther supper an' 'at for th' last month or two has been stoppin fowk 'at he's met an' shakin hands wi 'em an' axin all abaat ha ther wives an' childer are gettin on tho' he's passed th' same fowk monny a hundred times befoor an' nivver spokken to 'em at all | it's all plottin | a'a this little bit o' pride | a'a this desire to be summat thowt on | aw dooant know ha we should get on withaat it | ther's a gooid deeal o' califudge i'th' world after all but aw dooant think it does mich harm for mooast fowk can see throo it | but it allus maks me smile when aw goa to a ward meetin an' hear furst one an' then another get up an' thank a caancillor for dooin soa mich for 'em an' prayin 'at he'll suffer hissen to be re elected when at th' same time they know 'at he's ready to fall ov his knees to beg on 'em to send him agean | well aw dooant know why a chap shouldn't be thanked for dooin that 'at's a pleasure to hissen an' a benefit to others | it's nobbut th' same as me writin this it suits me to write it an' it suits others to read it yet aw think aw'm entitled to some thanks after all | but one munnot expect to get all they're entitled to an' its a jolly gooid job we dooant for if we did ther'd be a lot on us 'at ud have to be burried at th' public expense | we're nooan on us too gooid but 'it's niver too late to mend ' an' it's niver too sooin to begin soa nah 'at we've getten to th' end ov another year let us carefully reckon up an see ha we stand | aw fancy we shall all find 'at ther's lots o' room for improvement yet an' ther's nowt at yo can do 'at's likely to give yo moor satisfaction nor to detarmine to do better for th' future | a chap's allus awther better or war at th' end o'th' year nor what he wor at th' beginnin an aw'm sure iverybody'll feel pleased to know at they're all o'th' mendin hand | at length they fancied they heard sounds arise from the plain before them: suppressed noises such as must unavoidably be made by a force on its passage and alfred again sought the cell of dunstan yet dared not enter urgent though the emergency seemed | ther's nubdy enjoys a bit ov a spree better nor aw do but ther's one thing aw dooant like an that is to be pestered off my life booath at hooam an abroad wi fowk commin an sayin 'aw wish yo a merry christmas an' a happy new year ' when all th' time aw know weel enuff they wish nowt at sooart but just come for what they can get | nah if sich like wod nobbut come an' say plain aght 'we come to see what yo'll give us an' we dooant care a button whether yo've a merry christmas or net ' why then yo'd know what to mak on 'em | ony body at's ony gooid wishes to give let 'em give 'em but aw'm blow'd if aw care to buy' em becoss they arn't genuine at's to sell | th' price may be low enuff a glass o' whisky or a shillin but unless they come free gratis for nowt aw'd rather net be bothered wi' 'em |shoolers please tak nooatice |
