  a large masterful man was opechancanough sachem of the pamunkeys | the indians themselves said that he was not a powatan nor any relation of their king but that he came from the princely line of a great southern nation distant many leagues | this may be the reason that although he was allied to chief powatan he never joined him in friendship to the whites who he claimed if not checked would over run the indians' hunting grounds | the indians of virginia did not wish to have the white men among them | they were living well and comfortably before the white men came after the white men came with terrible weapons and huge appetites which they expected the indians to fill and a habit of claiming all creation clouds veiled the sky of the powatans their corn fields and their streams were no longer their own | powatan the head sachem collected guns and hatchets and planned to stem the tide while it was small | but these english enticed his daughter pocahontas aboard a vessel and there held her for the good behavior of her father | pocahontas married john rolfe an english gentleman of the colony | now for the first time powatan was won for he loved his daughter and the honest treatment of her at english hands pleased him | opechancanough but bided his time until 1622 | he was a thorough hater his weapons were treachery as well as open war he had resolved never to give up his country to the stranger | meanwhile pocahontas had died in 1617 aged about twenty two just when leaving england for a visit home | full of years and honors for he had been a shrewd noble minded king the sachem powatan himself died in 1618 aged over three score and ten | his elder brother o pi tchi pan became head sachem of the powatan league | he was not of high character like the great chief's | now opechancanough soon sprang to the front as champion of the nation | pocahontas was no longer a hostage the english settlements and plantations had increased the english in england were in numbers of the stars and the leaves and the sands and something must be done at once | seventy eight years of age he was when he struck his blow | with the fierce chick a hom i nies backing him he had enlisted tribe after tribe among the powatans | yet never a word of the plan reached the colonists | for several years peace had reigned in fair virginia | the indians were looked upon as only a naked timid people who durst not stand the presenting of a staff in the manner of a firelock in the hands of a woman |  firelocks and modern arms they did lack themselves but opechancanough the old hater had laid his plans to cover that | march 22 1622 was the date for the attack which should utterly extinguish the english settlements forever | yet forever could not have been the hope of opechancanough | here in virginia the white man's settlements had spread through five hundred miles and on the north the pilgrim fathers had started another batch in the country of the pokanokets | the plan of opechancanough succeeded perfectly | keeping the date secret tribe after tribe sent their warriors to arrive at the borders of the virginia settlements in the night of march 21 |  although some of the detachments had to march from great distances and through a continued forest guided only by the stars and moon no single instance of disorder or mistake is known to have happened | one by one they followed each other in profound silence treading as nearly as possible in each other's steps and adjusting the long grass and branches which they displaced | they halted at short distances from the settlements and waited in death like stillness for the signal of attack | a number of indians with whom the settlers were well acquainted had been doing spy work | it was quite the custom for indians to eat breakfast in settlers' homes and to sleep before the settlers' fire places | in this manner the habits of every family upon the scattered plantations were known | there were indians in the fields and in the houses and yards pretending to be friendly but preparing to strike | the moment agreed upon arrived | instantly the peaceful scene changed | acting all together the indians in the open seized hatchet ax club and gun whatever would answer the purpose and killed | some of the settlers had been decoyed into the timber many fell on their own thresholds and the majority died by their own weapons | the bands in ambush rushed to take a hand | in one hour three hundred and forty seven white men women and children had been massacred | it was a black black deed but so opechancanough had planned | treachery was his only strength | this spring a guerilla warfare was waged by both sides | blood hounds were trained to trail the indians | mastiffs were trained to pull them down | but the colonists needed crops without planted fields they would starve | the governor proposed a peace that both parties might plant their corn | when the corn in the indians' fields had ripened and was being gathered the settlers made their treacherous attack in turn | they killed without mercy destroyed the indians' supplies and believed that they had slain opechancanough | there was much rejoicing but opechancanough still lived in good health | he had been too clever for the trap | rarely seen himself by the settlers he continued to direct the movements of his warriors | he refused to enter the settlements | never yet had he visited jamestown | governors came and went but opechancanough remained unyielding | he was eighty seven when in 1630 a truce was patched up that both sides might rest a little | so far the indians had had somewhat the best of the fighting the colonists had not driven them to a safe distance | the white men were growing stronger the red men were improving not at all and opechancanough knew that the truce would surely be broken | he stayed aloof nine years waiting while the colonists grew careless | at last they quarreled among themselves | this was his chance | from the chickahominies and the pamunkeys the word was spread to the other tribes | the second of his plans ripened | opechancanough had so aged that he was unable to walk | he set the day of april 18 1644 as the time for the general attack | he ordered his warriors to bear him upon the field in a litter at the head of five united tribes | again the vengeful league of the powatans burst upon the settlers in virginia | from the mouth of the james river back inland over a space of six hundred square miles war ravaged for two days three hundred and more settlers were killed two hundred were made captives homes and supplies were burned to ashes | it looked as though nothing would stand before opechancanough indeed as though the end of virginia had come | but in the midst of the pillage the work suddenly was stopped the victorious indians fled and could not be rallied | they were frightened it is said by a bad sign in the sky | governor sir william berkeley called out every twentieth man and boy of the home guard militia and by horse and foot and dog pursued | next we may see the sachem opechancanough in his one hundredth year borne hither thither in his bough litter by his warriors directing them how to retreat where to fight and when to retreat again | he suffered severely from hunger and storm and long marches until the bones ridged his flabby skin he had lost all power over his muscles and his eyelids had to be lifted with the fingers before he could gaze beyond them | governor berkeley and a squadron of horsemen finally ran him down and captured him | they took him by aid of his litter bearers to jamestown | he was a curious sight for jamestown | by orders of the governor he was well treated on account of his great age and his courageous spirit | the governor planned to remove him to england as token of the healthfulness of the virginia climate | but all this made little difference to opechancanough | he had warred and had lost now he expected to be tortured and executed | he was so old and worn and so stern in his pride of chiefship that he did not care | he had been a sachem before the english arrived and he was a sachem still | nobody heard from his set lips one word of complaint or fear or pleading | instead he spoke haughtily | he rarely would permit his lids to be lifted that he might look about him | his faithful indian servants waited upon him | one day a soldier of the guard wickedly shot him through the back | the wound was mortal but the old chief gave not a twinge his seamed face remained as stern and firm as if of stone | he had resolved that his enemies should see in him a man | only when toward the end he heard a murmur and scuff of feet around him did he arouse | he asked his nurses to lift his eyelids for him | this was done | he coldly surveyed the people who had crowded into the room to watch him die | he managed to raise himself a little |  send in to me the governor he demanded angrily | governor berkeley entered |  it is time rebuked old opechancanough |  for had it been my fortune to have taken sir william berkeley prisoner i should not have exposed him as a show to my people | then opechancanough died a chief and an enemy to the last | the po kan o kets formed another league like the league of the powatans | there were nine tribes holding a section of southeastern massachusetts and of water broken eastern rhode island | the renowned massasoit of the wam pa no ag tribe was the grand sachem | in rhode island on the east shore of upper narragansett bay was the royal seat of montaup or mount hope at the village pokanoket | great was the sachem mas sa so it who ruled mildly but firmly and was to his people a father as well as a chief | of his children two sons were named wamsutta and metacomet | they were renamed in english alexander and philip by the governor of this colony of plymouth | alexander was the elder | he had married wetamoo who was the young squaw sachem of the neighboring village of pocasset to the east | philip married her sister woo to ne kau ske | when late in 1661 the sage massasoit died alexander became grand sachem of the pokanoket league | now the long reign of massasoit had been broken | with him out of the way certain hearts jealous of the wampanoags and their alliance with the english began to stir up trouble for the new sachem | they reported him as planning a revolt against plymouth colony | there may have been some truth in this | the puritans were a stern strict people who kept what they had seized and who constantly added more | to them the indians were heathens and inferiors not free allies but subjects of the king of england | before the landing of the pilgrims in the indians' territory sailing ships touching at the new england shore had borne indians away into slavery | since the landing of the pilgrims the pequots had been crushed in battle and captain miles standish had applied knife and rope to other indians | so some doubts as to the wisdom of massasoit's treaty with the english began to spread through the pokanokets | the plymouth officers ordered alexander to appear at court and answer the charges against him | when he delayed major josiah winslow was sent to get him | the major took ten armed men and proceeded for mount hope | on the way he found alexander and party in a hunting lodge their guns leaning outside | the major seized the guns | with pistol in hand he demanded that alexander come with him or die | alexander claimed that he was a sachem and free ruler not a dog | he fell into a raging passion | he had a proper pride and a fierce temper | he agreed to go as a sachem attended by his own followers | the charge against him never was pressed because his rage and shame at the insult threw him into a fever from which he soon died | he had reigned only a few months | in this year 1662 philip or metacomet took his place as grand sachem of the pokanokets | the death of his brother grieved him | wetamoo the young widow said that alexander had been poisoned by his captors the english | the story counted and the fate of alexander was not a pleasant story to the pokanokets | philip saw trouble ahead | his neighbors the narragansetts had long been at outs with the english | in his father's reign their old chief mi an to no mah had been handed over by the puritans of connecticut to chief uncas of the mohegans for execution in the indian way | the narragansetts were friendly with the pokanokets they rather looked upon philip as their adopted leader | his lands were rapidly going the english were rapidly spreading the puritan laws and religion were being forced upon him | it was galling that he a king by his own right should be made a subject of another king whom he had never seen | the new england colonists could not forget how the virginia colonists had been surprised and killed by the powatans | they watched king philip closely | in 1671 he was said to be complaining that certain of them were trespassing on his hunting grounds | this led to the report that his people were holding councils and were repairing their guns and sharpening their hatchets as if for war | so king philip like his brother king alexander was summoned to the puritan court to be examined | he had not forgotten the treatment of alexander | he went but he filled half the town meeting house with his armed warriors | there he denied that war was planned against the english | he was persuaded to sign a paper which admitted his guilt and bound him to deliver up all his guns | he decided not to do this latter thing | to give up his guns would leave him bare to all enemies | he was made to sign other papers until little by little the pokanokets seemed to have surrendered their rights except their guns | the white people and not philip ruled them | then in the first half of 1675 the affair of john sassamon occurred | john sassamon was an educated indian who had returned to the wampanoags after preaching | he spoke english and was used by king philip at mount hope as secretary | he thought that he had found out war plans and he carried the secrets to plymouth | the indian law declared that he should die | in march his body was discovered under the ice of a pond of plymouth colony | his neck had been broken | to the pokanoket idea this had been legal execution ordered by the sachem | the english called it a murder | they arrested three of king philip's men | these were tried in court before a jury of twelve colonists and five indians | they were found guilty | two were hanged the third was shot | that was the end of peace | miantonomah of the narragansetts had been handed over by the colonists to the law of the mohegans but when the pokanokets tried a similar law against a traitor they had been punished | king philip could no longer hold back his young men | he had been working hard in secret to enlist all the new england tribes in a league greater than the league of opechancanough and by one stroke clean new england of the white colonists | the time set was the next year 1676 | the narragansetts had promised then to have ready four thousand warriors | but when the word from the english court was carried to pokanoket that the three prisoners were to be killed and that philip himself was likely to be tried the warriors of the wampanoags broke their promise to wait | they danced defiantly | they openly sharpened their knives and hatchets upon the stone window sills of settlers' houses and made sport of the english | a sudden cold fear spread through new england | a blood red cloud seemed to be hovering over | signs were seen in the sky a great indian bow a great indian scalp racing horsemen a battle was heard with boom of cannon and rattle of muskets and whistling of bullets | the pious puritans ordered a fast day for public prayer in the hope that god would stay the threatened scourge | upon that very day june 24 1675 the war burst into flame | at the town of swansea massachusetts near the rhode island border and the nearest settlement to mount hope a wampanoag was wounded by an angered colonist | the indians were glad | they believed that the party whose blood was shed first would be victors | the colonists returning from town meeting were fired upon that day seven were killed and several wounded | king philip's young men had acted without orders | when king philip heard he wept | he was not yet ready for the war but now he had to fight | he had at hand sixty wampanoag men of fighting age all the pokanoket league numbered six hundred warriors | against these could be mustered thousands of the colonists whose ninety towns extended through massachusetts and connecticut and into present rhode island | therefore he must act swiftly or his cause was lost | all depended upon his appeal to the inland tribes on the north | the powerful narragansetts his neighbors on the west were not prepared and sent no warriors at once but certain of the other tribes did respond with gun and hatchet and fire | before the colonists could rally under a skillful leader the forces of king philip were successful | he had plenty of guns and ammunition | town after town in plymouth colony of southeastern massachusetts was laid in ashes by fierce surprise attacks | the scene shifted to western massachusetts | the nipmucks of the connecticut river there aided in the dreadful work | throughout the summer and fall of 1675 all settled massachusetts rang with the war whoops of the pokanokets and their allies | king philip proved himself a master in indian warfare to strike and run and strike again | in this one brief space he earned his title the terror of new england not only because of his first successes but also because during the span of more than a year no englishman recognized his voice in battle and only once was his face seen by his enemies | long after the war his name was used for frightening children |  king philip is coming | and the naughtiest child would quiet and seek his mother's skirt | although tortures and brutal killings were committed king philip himself opposed this | many stories are told of his kindness to captives | he showed fully as much mercy as the colonists did | some tribes had failed to help | the mohegans under uncas enlisted with the english which was expected | the praying indians as the christianized pokanokets were known also either stayed aloof or else were used as scouts against their people | the new hampshire indians refused to take up the hatchet and the narragansetts still hung back | king philip's own home of pokanoket or mount hope had of course early been seized by the english troops | they had planned to keep him from escaping to the mainland in the north | but he easily moved his men out by way of the narrow neck that connected with the mainland | now he was a roamer until in this winter of 1675 he decided to stay among the narragansetts in southern rhode island and renew his league | to compel the narragansetts to deliver over the king philip people an army of fifteen hundred was raised by massachusetts plymouth and connecticut colonies | south rhode island was then an indian wilderness heavily timbered and deep with swamps | near present south kingston in the narragansett country upon a meadow upland amidst a dense swamp philip had built a fort containing five hundred wigwams | he had built well | the only entrance from the swamp was defended by a high log fence or series of palisades | in addition around a space of five acres he had laid a thick hedge of felled trees | a single log bridged the water separating the fort from the drier land beyond | the wigwams were made bullet proof by great stores of supplies piled against their walls inside | it was reported that he had three thousand persons in the fort these being his pokanokets and many narragansett men women and children | the place was called sunke squaw | treachery it was that broke the power of king philip | an indian named peter sought the english and offered to show them how to get in | after a long march amidst bitter cold and driving snow they arrived at one o'clock in the afternoon of december 19 | they were short of provisions and very weary | for a time matters went ill with them | again and again their attacking parties were swept from the single log that peter the traitor had showed to them | a number of officers and men had fallen before pressing hard with night at hand a party succeeded in entering the fort | here the hot fight passed from wigwam to wigwam | some of the english were killed by balls from their own soldiers | through all the swamp the battle raged |  they run they run | sounded the loud cries from the english within the fort | their comrades on the outside hastened scrambling wading straddling the log or knee deep in the half frozen mire | indian women and children and warriors had taken refuge in the wigwams | torches were applied burning them or driving them out to be shot down | officers tried to prevent the burning of the wigwams in order to save the provisions but the fire spread | so by night the fort was in ruins | the indians were killed captured or fleeing | seven hundred had been killed by bullet and sword three hundred more perished by cold and hunger and wounds how many old men women and children had burned to death no one knew | but a third of the narragansett nation had been slain or taken captive and of the pokanokets only a remnant was left | eighty killed was the report of the connecticut troops alone | there were one hundred and fifty men grievously wounded | as the soldiers had destroyed the fort and its provisions they had no shelter | through a furious snowstorm they made a miserable night march of eighteen miles before even the wounded could be attended to | king philip was now a fugitive but he was by no means done fighting | he removed to the interior of massachusetts it is said that he traveled clear to the mohawks of new york and asked their aid in this war against the english | he did not get it | from january on into the summer of 1676 the war whoop the gun shot and the torch again terrified the colonies | aided by a few allies king philip was making his last great effort | he carried the war to within twenty miles of boston | of ninety towns in new england thirteen had been burned six hundred buildings had been leveled in smoke and six hundred arms bearing colonists killed |  these were the most distressing days that new england ever beheld reads a record |  all was fear and consternation | few there were who were not in mourning for some near kindred and nothing but horror stared them in the face | presently captain benjamin church as noted in new england as kit carson is in the west was upon the sachem's trail | he was a skilled indian fighter he knew king philip's haunts and all the indian ways | there was no let up by captain church | some captives he turned into scouts so that they helped him against their former chief the more dangerous he shot or hanged | to the english notion these hostile indians were rebels against the government and deserved no mercy | other captives especially women and children were sent to the west indies as slaves | soon king philip's allies began to desert him | they saw no hope of lasting victory they accused king philip of persuading them into a useless war and either scattered or went over to the english | among the deserters was queen awashonks squaw sachem of the sogkonate tribe of the pokanoket league | her country lay in the southeast corner of rhode island | when philip had heard that the sog ko nates were helping captain church to trail him down he is said to have smiled never again | chief canonchet great leader of the narragansetts was captured and executed | thus another nail was driven into king philip's fate | of queen wetamoo's three hundred warriors twenty six remained they were betrayed by one of their own number and captured and wetamoo was drowned in flight | these deaths saddened philip but the many desertions blackened his horizon and he knew that he was doomed | by midsummer he was fleeing from spot to spot with captain church hard after | he had only a handful of pokanokets and scarcely more narragansetts with him | although frequently attacking he himself was never sighted | the english accused him of hiding in cowardly fashion but he well knew that with his death or capture the war would be ended | only the name king philip supported it still | toward the close of july he had been forced south to his own wampanoag country of mount hope and pocasset | in a sally north into southern massachusetts he was surprised on sunday july 30 and his uncle killed and his sister taken prisoner | the next morning there came in haste from plymouth the doughty captain church aided by queen awashonks's men | where a tree had been felled for a bridge of escape across the taunton river thirty miles south of boston he espied on the opposite bank an indian sitting alone upon a stump | the captain aimed and would have fired but his indian companion said: no | i think him one of our own men | the indian upon the stump slowly turned his head the captain saw that he was king philip with his hair cut short | at the fall of the gun hammer king philip leaped from the stump and plunging down a steep bank was gone | captain church crossed the river in pursuit but did not catch him | the next day he came upon the beaten sachem's forlorn camp | there he captured philip's wife woo to ne kau ske and their little boy of nine years | the end of king philip was very near | his relatives even his sister in law wetamoo had died his friends had deserted him his remaining family were in the hands of his enemies |  you now have made philip ready to die for you have made him as poor and miserable as he used to make the english captain church's indian scouts praised |  you have now killed or taken all his relations | this bout has almost broken his heart and you will soon have his head | the head of king philip was indeed the prize | his escape north was barred by a great english army his flight southward into rhode island was limited by the sea | his kenneling places as they were styled perhaps because of the dog's life that he was leading were constantly betrayed and his force of true hearts was melting like the snows | but he received no offer of mercy | none was sent and he asked for none | he doubled and twisted in vain and tried an ambush | captain church easily side stepped this and with only thirty english and twenty indian scouts in two days killed or captured one hundred and seventy three more of the philip people | assuredly king philip was growing weak | he might have listened to terms but in those stern days terms were not made with rebels especially with troublesome indians who were assumed to be children of satan | captain church urged on by the plymouth government closed in farther | now died two of king philip's remaining captains | sam barrow as noted a rogue as any among the enemy was captured and sentenced at once to death by captain church | he was an old man but a hatchet was sunk into his head | chief totoson with his eight year boy and old wife escaped and reached agawom his former home | his little son fell sick his own heart became a stone within him and he died | his old wife threw some brush and leaves over his body and soon she also died | thus was the totoson family disposed of | only old annawan philip's greatest captain was left with him | they two and their miserable band of men women and children sought last refuge at the abandoned mount hope | here they were back again defeated with nowhere else to turn | on the morning of august 10 captain church was home also visiting his wife | he lived on the island of rhode island in narragansett bay and separated by only a narrow strait from mount hope on the north | there he had word in much haste that one of king philip's men was waiting to guide him to a swamp where the sachem might be killed | the name of the king philip man was alderman in english | his brother had proposed to king philip that they all surrender and king philip had struck him dead | so revenge burned in alderman's heart and he turned traitor | he was of the queen wetamoo people but had deserted her also | upon getting word of king philip's whereabouts so near at hand captain church kissed his wife goodby and gladly mounted his horse again hoping he said by tomorrow morning to have the rogue's head | this night alderman guided the captain's force truly | they had not far to go only a dozen or so miles up the mount hope peninsula to the narrow neck | the captain was well acquainted with the exact spot: a little isle of dry land in the midst of the swamp | on the morning of august 12 he had his men arranged silently | captain golding was given the honor of beating up philip's headquarters | with a picked party crawling on their bellies he entered to surprise the little isle and drive out the game | throughout the swamp the other men were placed two a white man and an indian by two behind trees that none might pass undiscovered | when the enemy should be started in flight then all the attacking party were to make a great noise | every figure moving without noise was to be fired upon by the ambuscade | there were not quite enough men to complete the circle of the ambuscade | however captain church took his aide major sanford by the hand and said: sir i have so placed the men that it is scarce possible philip should escape them | there was no thought of sparing king philip's life | he was an outlaw | just as the captain finished his hopeful speech a gun shot echoed through the misty gray | captain golding's men had come upon one indian and had fired and then had poured a volley into the sleeping camp | again from the harried band rose the cry awannux |awannux  english english  and into the swamp they plunged | caleb cook and alderman the guide had been stationed together behind a tree | at the first gun shot says the captain church story king philip threw his petunk shot pouch and powder horn over his head catched up his gun and ran as fast as he could scamper without any more clothes than his small breeches and stockings | and here he came directly for the tree | the two behind it let him come fair within shot | then caleb took the first fire upon him | but the gun only flashed in the pan | he bade the indian fire away and alderman did so true to purpose sent one musket bullet through king philip's heart and another not above two inches from it | the gun had been loaded with two balls | king philip fell upon his face in the mud and the water with his gun under him | he was dead at last on the soil of his long time home land from which he had sallied to do battle in vain |  by this time reads the captain church story the enemy perceived that they were waylaid on the east side of the swamp and tacked short about | one of the enemy who seemed to be a great surly old fellow hallooed with a loud voice and often called out 'i oo tash i oo tash '| captain church called to his indian peter and asked him who that was that called so | he answered that it was old annawan philip's great captain calling on his soldiers to stand to it and fight stoutly | now the enemy finding that place of the swamp which was not ambushed many of them made their escape in the english tracks | when the pursuit had quit captain church let his men know that king philip had been killed and they gave three cheers | then the captain ordered the body to be pulled out of the mud | so some of the indians took hold of him by his stockings and some by his small breeches being otherwise naked and drew him through the mud to the upland and a doleful great naked dirty beast he looked like according to their opinion |  forasmuch as you have caused many an englishman's body to be unburied and to rot above ground not one of your bones shall be buried pronounced captain church | and he ordered an old indian who acted as executioner to behead and quarter king philip | but before he struck with the hatchet the old indian also made a little speech to the body |  you have been a very great man he said and have made many a man afraid of you but so big as you are i will now chop you up | and so he did | king philip was known not only by his face but by a mangled hand in which a pistol had burst | his head and his crippled hand were awarded to alderman who had betrayed him alderman was told to exhibit them through new england if he wished as a traveling show | he gained many shillings in fees | the four quarters of king philip were hung to the branches of a tree | the head was stuck upon a gibbet at plymouth for twenty years | the hand was kept at boston | caleb cook traded with alderman for king philip's gun and king philip's wife and little boy were sold as slaves in the west indies | i am all serene | you won't find i possess either nerves or fear | 'be sure you are right and then go ahead ' is my law |  well i'll be confounded | said the doctor | in a large hall peopled with thousands of medical men the name of the harvester was called the following day and his subject was announced | he arose in his place and began to talk |  take the platform came in a roar from a hundred throats | the harvester hesitated |  you must david whispered carey | the harvester made his way forward and was guided through a side door and a second later calmly walked down the big stage to the front and stood at ease looking over his audience as if to gauge its size and the pitch to which he should raise his voice | his lean frame loomed every inch of his six feet his broad shoulders were square his clean shaven face alert and afire | he wore a spring suit of light gray of good quality and cut and he was perfect as to details |  this scarcely seems compatible with my subject he remarked casually |  i certainly appear very much in the foreground just at present but perhaps that is quite as well | it may be time that i assert myself | i doubt if there is a man among you who has not handled my products more or less you may enjoy learning where and how they are prepared and understanding the manner in which my work merges with yours | i think perhaps the first thing is to paint you as good a word picture as i can of my geographical location | then the harvester named latitude and longitude and degrees of temperature | he described the lake the marsh the wooded hill the swale and open sunny fields | he spoke of water soil shade and geographical conditions | truly a warrior queen she was and so she remained to the last ever loyal to the losing cause of her grand sachem and to the memory of alexander | with philip she was driven southward back toward her home of pocasset east of mount hope | by the first week in august of 1676 she had only twenty six men left out of her three hundred | then there came to the colonists at taunton which lay up the river taunton from pocasset another deserter with word that he could lead them to the little wetamoo camp not far southward | twenty armed english descended upon her august 6 and easily overcame her camp | she alone escaped in flight | she had no thought of surrendering herself into slavery | in making her way to pocasset she attempted reads the tale to get over a river or arm of the sea near by upon a raft or some pieces of broken wood but whether tired and spent with swimming or starved with cold and hunger she was found stark naked in metapoiset near present swansea of southern massachusetts at the rhode island line not far from the water side which made some think she was first half drowned and so ended her wretched life | no respect was paid to her | her head was cut off and hoisted upon a pole in the town of taunton as revenge for the similar beheading of some english bodies earlier in the war | when in taunton the pocasset captives saw the head they made a most horrid and diabolical lamentation crying out that it was their queen's head | here let us close the melancholy story of the warrior queen wetamoo who as the companion in arms of her sachem sought to avenge her husband's death as well as to save her country from the foreigner | however wetamoo and philip together dragged the once mighty narragansetts down | this brings to the surface the tale of canonchet the big hearted | the narragansetts were a large and warlike people and hard fighters | their country covered nearly all present rhode island the city of providence was founded in their midst when the great preacher roger williams sought refuge among them | they conquered other tribes to the north and west | when king philip rose in 1675 they numbered of themselves five thousand people and could put into the field two thousand warriors | in the beginning under their noble sachem can on i cus they were friendly to the english colonists | while roger williams lived among them they stayed friendly | they agreed to a peace with sachem massasoit's pokanokets who occupied the rest of rhode island east across narragansett bay | they marched with the english and the mohegans to wipe out the hostile pequots | canonicus died and mi an to no mah his nephew who had helped him rule became chief sachem | miantonomah was famed in council and in war | the colonies suspected him as they did alexander son of massasoit | they favored the mohegans of the crafty sachem uncas | when miantonomah had been taken prisoner by uncas at the battle of sachem's plain in connecticut 1643 the united colonies of connecticut massachusetts and plymouth directed that the mohegans put him to death as a treaty breaker | accordingly uncas ordered him killed by the hatchet and ate a piece of his shoulder | possibly miantonomah deserved to die but the hearts of the narragansetts grew very sore | it is scarcely to be wondered at that they favored the pokanokets rather than the english when king philip who also had suffered called upon them to aid in cleaning the land of the white enemy |  brothers we must be as one as the english are or we shall soon all be destroyed had said miantonomah in a speech to a distant tribe and that looked to be so | ca non chet whose name in indian was qua non chet pronounced the same and nan un te noo was son of the celebrated miantonomah | he was now chief sachem of the narragansetts and the friend of king philip | he was a tall strongly built man and accused by the english of being haughty and insolent | why not | he was of proud narragansett blood from the veins of a long line of great chiefs and the english had given his father into the eager hands of the enemy | presently he was asked to sign treaties that would make him false to the memory of miantonomah and double hearted toward the hopeful king philip | the papers engaged the narragansetts not to harbor any of king philip's people nor to help them in any way against the english nor to enter a war without the permission of the english | he was to deliver the philip and wetamoo people when they came to him | canonchet was not that kind of a man | he had no idea of betraying people who may have fled to him for shelter from a common enemy | a few of his men feared | it was suggested to him that he yield to the colonies lest the narragansetts be swallowed up by the english | he replied like a chief and the son of miantonomah | the venerable roger williams his friend the friend of his father and the friend of the long dead canonicus had advised him to stay out of the war |  massachusetts said roger williams can raise thousands of men at this moment and if you kill them the king of england will supply their place as fast as they fall |  it is well replied canonchet |  let them come | we are ready for them | but as for you brother williams you are a good man you have been kind to us many years | we shall burn the english in their houses but not a hair of your head shall be touched | the colonies did not wait for canonchet to surrender the king philip people | the treaty had been signed on october 28 and on november 2 an army from connecticut massachusetts and plymouth was ordered out to march against the narragansetts and seize king philip and queen wetamoo and punish canonchet | it was known that queen wetamoo was with canonchet but not certainly that king philip had kenneled there | at any rate down marched the english their mohegan and pequot allies all piloted by one peter who might have been the husband of wetamoo herself but who probably was a narragansett traitor | canonchet stood firm | to his notion he was not obliged to surrender anybody while the english held his brother and three other narragansetts | besides deliver the indians of philip |no  not the paring of a wampanoag's nail | on the afternoon of december 19 this year 1675 the bold english and their allies struck the great fortified village at sunke squaw | out from the heat and smudge of the blazing wigwams fled philip and wetamoo and canonchet with their shrieking people into the wintry swamp where the snowy branches of the cedars and hemlocks were their only refuge | canonchet had lost a third of his nation large numbers surrendered to the english but like his friend philip with his warriors who remained true he carried the war to the english themselves | and a terrible war it was | in march captain william peirse was sent out with seventy stout men to march from plymouth and head off the raging narragansetts | plymouth had heard that the haughty young sachem canonchet was on his way to plymouth at the van of three hundred warriors | captain peirse made his will and marched southward to the pawtucket river not far above providence | canonchet's spies had marked him and canonchet was ready | on march 26 which was a sunday captain peirse saw upon the other side of the river a party of indians limping as if worn out and trying to get away | therefore he crossed near the pawtucket falls in glad pursuit and no sooner was he upon the western side than the warriors of nanuntenoo like an avalanche from a mountain rushed down upon him nor striving for coverts from which to fight more than their foes fought them face to face with the most determined bravery | there were narragansetts still upon the east side of the river also to cut off retreat | the captain fighting desperately with his men ranged in two ranks back to back sent a runner to providence only six or eight miles for assistance but so quickly was the work done by canonchet that of all the english force only one englishman escaped and not above a dozen of the scouts |  captain peirse was slain and forty and nine english with him and eight or more indians who did assist the english | canonchet lost one hundred and forty but it was a great victory well planned and well executed | captain peirse had been a leader in the storming of the narragansett fort at sunke squaw the last winter that is one reason why the canonchet warriors fought so ravenously to take revenge | on the day after the dreadful battle from connecticut southwest there marched a larger force of english and friendly indians to close the red trail of the sachem canonchet | he was feared as much as king philip was feared | canonchet did not proceed against plymouth | with thirty volunteers he had set out south for the mount hope region itself in order to gather seed corn | the abandoned fields of the english along the connecticut river waited | they ought to be planted to indian corn | on his way back to the connecticut river with his seed corn near the close of the first week in april he made camp almost upon the very battle ground above providence where yet the soil was stained by the blood of march 26 | he did not know that now the enemy were upon his trail indeed but at the moment a company of fifty english under captain george denison of southerton connecticut and eighty indians the mohegans led by chief oneka son of uncas the pequots by cas sa sin na mon the niantics formerly allies of the narragansetts by cat a pa zet were drawing near | three other companies were in the neighborhood | this day canonchet was lying in his blanket telling to a party of seven warriors the story of the battleground | the other warriors were scattered through the forest | two sentries had been placed upon a hill | not far away the captain denison party already had killed one warrior and had seized two old squaws | the squaws confessed that nanuntenoo was yonder the indian scouts picked up the fresh trail the denison men hastened at best speed | in the midst of his story canonchet saw his two sentinels dash headlong past the wigwam as if they wanted for time to tell what they had seen | at once he sent a third man to report upon what was the matter | this third man likewise suddenly made off at full pace without a word | then two more he sent of these one returning breathless paused long enough to say that all the english army was upon him |  whereupon having no time to consult and but little time to attempt an escape and no means to defend himself he began to fly with all speed | running with great swiftness around the hill to get out of sight upon the opposite side he was distinguished by his wary pursuers and they were hot after him | in fact running hard around the hill canonchet wellnigh ran into the niantics of chief catapazet who were coming down right over the hill | he swerved at the view halloo and lengthened his stride | some of the english had joined the chase | canonchet tore like a deer for the river | they had not recognized him for he was wearing his blanket | but so hotly they pressed him that he needs must cast aside his blanket | this revealed to them his fine lace embroidered coat which had been given to him as a bribe at boston last october | now they knew that he was a chief and a personage and they yelled louder and ran faster | presently canonchet stripped off his lacy coat and dropped it | and soon loosening his belt of wampum he dropped that also | by this chief's belt they knew that he was the great canonchet and faster still they ran | however he was out footing all except one indian | that indian was a pequot named monopoide the best runner of all and better than canonchet himself | with only a single pursuer to be feared canonchet turned sharply and leaped into the river to cross by a strange trail | as he splashed through wading find plunging seeing escape close before him if he could gain the opposite bank he stumbled upon a stone | falling forward he not only lost valuable time but soused his gun |  at that accident he afterward said my heart and bowels turned within me so that i became like a rotten stick void of strength | all you needed to a done was to take her in your arms and make her your wife and she'd 'a' waked up to what you meant by love |  but suppose she never awakened |  aw bosh | s'pose water won't wet | s'pose fire won't burn | s'pose the sun won't shine | canonchet was both and might yet have fought loose to liberty | but he had made up his mind to quit | he offered no trouble the guns of the pursuing party were covering him again and he obeyed the orders | he did not break his silence until young robert staunton first of the english to reach him asked him questions | this was contrary to indian usage | canonchet looked upon him disdainfully |  you much child | no understand matters of war let your brother or chief come him i will answer | robert's brother john staunton was captain of one of the connecticut companies that had been sent out to find the narragansetts but canonchet was now turned over to captain denison | he was offered his life if he would help the english | this brought from him a glare of rebuke | he was offered his life if he would send orders to his people to make peace |  say no more about that he replied |  i will not talk of peace | i do not care to talk at all | i was born a sachem | if sachems come to speak with me i will answer but none present being such i am obliged in honor to myself to hold my tongue |  if you do not accept the terms offered to you you will be put to death |  killing me will not end the war | there are two thousand men who will revenge me |  you richly deserve death | you can expect no mercy | you have said that you would burn the english in their houses | you have boasted that you would not deliver up a single wampanoag nor the paring of a wampanoag's nail |  i desire to hear no more about it replied canonchet |  others were as eager in the war as myself and many will be found of the same mind | have not the english burned my people in their houses | did you ever deliver up to the narragansetts any of the narragansetts' enemies | why then should i deliver up to them the wampanoags | i would rather die than remain prisoner | you have one of equal rank here with myself | he is oneka son of uncas | his father killed my father | let oneka kill me | he is a sachem |  you must die |  i like it well | i shall die before my heart is soft or i have said anything of which canonchet shall be ashamed | even his enemies admired him | the english compared him to some old roman | he was not killed here | forty three of his people men and women had been taken by the troops and scouts a number of these were given over to death by the scout indians | but canonchet was borne in triumph to stonington connecticut | in order to reward the friendly indians the pequots were permitted to shoot him the mohegans to behead and to quarter him the niantics to burn him | as a return favor the indians presented the head of canonchet or nanuntenoo to the english council at hartford connecticut | in the above fashion perished without a plea in the prime of his manhood canonchet of the big heart last grand sachem of the narragansetts | presently only the name of his nation remained | the hurons styled in english wyandots fled clear into michigan and spread down into northern ohio | of the algonkins there were three nations who clung together as the council of the three fires | these were the ottawas the ojibwas and the potawatomis | the ottawas were known as the trade people and the raised hairs | they had claimed the river ottawa in which was the allumette island upon which piskaret and the adirondacks had lived | the ojibways were known as the puckered moccasin people from the words meaning to roast till puckered up | their tanned moccasins had a heavy puckered seam | the name ojibwa rapidly pronounced became in english chippeway | as chippeways and chippewas have they remained | the potawatomis whose name is spelled also pottawattamis were known as the nation of fire | they had lived the farthest westward of all until the sioux met them and forced them back | the ottawas were recorded by the early french as rude and barbarous | the chippewas or ojibwas were recorded as skillful hunters and brave warriors | the potawatomis were recorded as the most friendly and kind hearted among the northern indians | of these people many still exist in canada and the united states | when england aided by her american colonies began to oppose france in the new world in 1755 the three fires helped the french | they were then holding part of present wisconsin and all of michigan | now in the fall of 1760 france had lost canada | she was about to surrender to england all her forts and trading posts of the upper mississippi basin from the great lakes to the ohio river | in november major robert rogers a noted american ranger of new hampshire birth with two hundred hardy american woodsmen in twelve whaleboats and with a herd of fat cattle following the shores was on his way from montreal by water to carry the english tongue and the british flag to the french posts of the great lakes | he had passed several posts and was swinging around for detroit when a storm of sleet and rain kept him in camp amidst the thick timber where today stands the city of cleveland ohio | here he was met by a party of indians from the west bearing a message |  you must go no farther they said pontiac is coming | he is the king and lord of this country you are in | wait till he can see you with his own eyes | that same day in the afternoon chief pontiac himself appeared | major rogers saw a dark medium tall but very powerful indian aged near fifty years wearing not only richly embroidered clothes but also an air of majesty and princely grandeur | pontiac spoke like a great chief and ruler |  i have come to find out what you are doing in this place and how you dare to pass through my country without my permission | major rogers replied smoothly |  i have no design against you or your people | i am here by orders from your new english fathers to remove the french from your country so that we may trade in peace together | and he gave the chief a pledge of wampum | pontiac returned another belt |  i shall stand in the path you are walking till morning was all that he would say and closed the matter for the night | during the storm of the next few days he smoked the pipe of peace with the major and promised safe passage for him to detroit | thus major rogers was the first of the english americans to be face to face with one of the master minds of the indian americans | this pontiac was head chief not alone of the ottawas but of the chippewas and potawatomis | rumor has declared that he was born a dark catawba of that fierce fighting nation in south carolina who frequently journeyed north to fall upon the northern tribes | but his father probably was an ottawa his mother an ojibwa | by reason of his strong mind and his generalship in peace and in war he was accepted as a leader throughout all the great lakes country | the name and fame of pontiac had extended far into the south and into the east | it is said that he commanded the whole indian force at the bloody braddock's field south of pittsburg when on july 9 1755 the british regulars of general sir william braddock aided by the colonial militia of major george washington were crushed and scattered by the french and indians | before that he had saved the french garrison of detroit from an attack by hostile foxes | come on |  one minute said the doctor |  david i am making up a list of friends to whom i am going to send programmes of the medical meeting and i thought your wife might like to see you among the speakers and your subject | what is her address | he astonished the major by his shrewd questions as to how the english waged war how their clothing was made how they got iron from the ground for their weapons | he even stated that he was willing to form an alliance with the king of england and to call him uncle but that he must be allowed to reign as he pleased in his own country or he would shut up the way and keep the english out | puzzled and stung by the news that their fathers the french had been beaten in war a great number of ottawas potawatomis chippewas sacs and wyandots gathered at old detroit to witness the surrender | they could not understand why the french should march out and lay down their arms to such a small company of english | evidently these english were gifted with powers that made their enemies weak | for a brief space all went well while the indians of pontiac's country watched to see what kind of men these english should prove to be | but the name of the english already was bad | these northern tribes well knew what had occurred in virginia and in new england | the powatans the pokanokets the narragansetts and other peoples had been wiped out their lands seized | the english were bent upon being masters not allies | there was found to be a great difference in the methods of the french and these english | the french treated chiefs as equals and tribes as brothers and children lived in their lodges ate of their food created good feeling by distributing presents interfered little with ancient customs traded fairly and forebade whiskey | the english despised the indians lived apart demanded rather than asked were stingy in trading and cheated by means of liquor |  when the indians visited the forts instead of being treated with attention and politeness they were received gruffly subjected to indignities and not infrequently helped out of the fort with the butt of a sentry's musket or a vigorous kick from an officer | pontiac and his people soon saw this | the french canadian traders still at large took pains to whisper in cunning fashion that the great french king was old and had been asleep while the english were arming but that now he had awakened and his young men were coming to rescue his red children | a fleet of great canoes was on its way up the st lawrence river to capture the lakes and the french and the indians would again live together | the three fires and their allies the sacs and the wyandots longed for the pleasant company of their french brothers | in his village on the canada border just across the river from detroit pontiac watched these red coats for two years and found as he thought nothing good in them or their cheating traders and he resolved to be rid of them all | with the eye of a chief and a warrior he had noted also that they were a foolish people | as if despising the power of the indian they garrisoned their posts with only small forces although many of these posts were lonely spots far separated by leagues of water and forest from any outside aid | messages from one to another could be easily stopped | the french were being allowed to remain and to move about freely | the peace treaty between the french and the english had not yet been signed | no doubt the french would join the indians in driving the invaders from this country so rich in corn and fish and game | out of his brooding and his hate pontiac formed his plan | it was a plan like the plan of opechancanough and king philip but on a larger scale | he worked at it alone until he was prepared to set it in motion | then late in the year 1762 he sent to the eastward his runners bearing to the senecas a red stained tomahawk and a bloody belt | they carried the message: the english mean to make slaves of us by occupying so many posts in our country | let us try now to recover our liberty rather than wait until they are stronger | from the senecas the bloody belt was passed to the delawares of western new york and eastern pennsylvania from the delawares to the shawnees of western pennsylvania and eastern ohio from the shawnees it was passed westward to the miamis and the wyandots of indiana | several thousands of miles had the bloody belt traveled when in march of 1763 it was caught and stopped by ensign holmes the young commander at old fort miami near the present city of fort wayne indiana | he sent it back to detroit far northward with a note of warning for major gladwyn the commander | he believed that with the stoppage of the belt he had checked the plan | major gladwyn in turn reported to his superiors that this was a trifling matter which would blow over | the belt may have been stopped but not the word of pontiac | it traveled on until from lake superior of the canada border down to kentucky all the tribes between the alleghanies and the mississippi river were only waiting for the day | vague rumors brought in by traders and friendly scouts floated hither thither rumors of mysterious remarks of secret councils of a collecting of arms and powder and a sharpening of knives and hatchets even among tribes remote from the posts | but the garrisons were not reinforced | the soldiers idled and joked the indians came and went as usual gates were not closed except at night | a delaware prophet was reported to be preaching death to the red coats | unrest seethed and yet could not be traced to any source | on april 27 unknown to a single one of the english at the great lakes a hundred strange chiefs gathered within a few miles of detroit itself to confer with pontiac | in the midst of the forest he addressed them | here seated in a large circle were ottawas ojibwas sacs potawatomis wyandots senecas miamis shawnees foxes delawares menominis all intent for the words of pontiac | his speech was full of fire and eloquence | he was an orator | he reminded his brothers of their treatment by the english and of their better treatment by the french their friends who had been ousted | he told them that now was the time to rise when the war canoes of their french father were on the way to re people the land with happiness | a prophet had been born among the delawares said pontiac | the great spirit had appeared to this prophet in a dream and had demanded why the indians suffered the white strangers to live in this land that he had provided with everything for the indian's use | let the indians return to the customs of their ancestors fling away the blankets the coats the guns the fire water and use again the skins the bows and the native foods and be independent |  as for these english these dogs dressed in red drive them from your hunting grounds drive them | and then when you are in distress i will help you | the day was named by pontiac | it should date from the change of the moon in the next month or about may 7 | at that time should begin the work by all the tribes of seizing every english fort and trading post in the great lakes country and west of the alleghany mountains | the tribes nearest to each should attend to the matter strike when they heard that he had struck detroit | the date and the plan were approved | the council broke up | as silently as they had come the chiefs went home some by water some afoot and no white man knew of the meeting | detroit was the largest and most important of the english posts | pontiac himself would seize this by aid of his ottawas some potawatomis and wyandots | to the chippewas and the sacs was given over the next important fur trade station that of mich il i mac ki nac north | it enclosed a church and eighty or one hundred houses mainly of french settlers with a sprinkling of english traders | in the block houses at the corners and protecting the gates light cannon were mounted | the garrison consisted of only one hundred and twenty men of the eightieth foot | in the village there were perhaps forty other men | on both sides of the river lay the fertile farms of the french settlers | back of the farms on the east or canadian side and about five miles from detroit was the teeming village of pontiac's ottawas | potawatomis and wyandots also lived near | at pontiac's call there waited more than a thousand warriors | the set time approached | on may 1 pontiac and forty chiefs and warriors entered the fort and danced the calumet a peace dance for the pleasure of their officers | pontiac said to major gladwyn that he would return at the change of the moon may 7 or in one week to hold a council with him and brighten the chain of peace with the english | the major agreed | he was a very foolish man for a chief | having returned to his village pontiac called a different kind of a council there a war council of one hundred chiefs | they were to have their people cut off the ends of muskets that should be carried concealed under the blankets | sixty chiefs and warriors should go with him into the council chamber at the fort the others should linger in the streets of the town and at the fort gates | he would speak to the major with a belt white on the one side green on the other | when he turned the belt and presented it wrong end first let every warrior kill an english soldier beginning with the officers | at the sound let every warrior outside the council use gun and hatchet | on may 5 a french settler's wife crossed the river to buy maple sugar and deer meat at the ottawa village | she saw the warriors busy filing at their gun barrels shortening the guns to scarce a yard of length | this was a curious thing to do | when she went back to the post she spoke about it |  that said the blacksmith explains why those fellows have been borrowing all my files and hack saws | they wouldn't tell me what for | something's brewing | when major gladwyn was informed still he would not believe | but the fur traders at the post insisted that when an indian shortened his gun he meant mischief | the opinion of fur traders carried no weight with major gladwyn the british officer | the next evening catharine a pretty ojibwa girl who lived with the potawatomis came to see him in his quarters | she was his favorite | she had agreed to make him a pair of handsome moccasins from an elk hide | now she brought the moccasins and the rest of the hide | usually she had been much pleased to look upon and talk with the handsome young major in the red clothes | this time her face was clouded she hung her head and spoke hardly at all | her eager girlishness had vanished | the major's delight with the moccasins failed to cheer her up | trying to win her smiles he told her the moccasins were so beautiful that he wished to give them to a friend | would she take the elk hide away with her and make another pair of moccasins for himself | she finally left with strangely slow step and backward glances | at sunset when the gates of the fort were to be closed the guard found her still inside | as she would not go the sergeant took word to the major |  she won't talk with me sir he reported |  send her in and i will talk with her ordered the major | catharine came downcast silent and timid |  why have you not gone before the gates are shut catharine | she hesitated |  i did not wish to take away the skin that is yours |  but you did take it away as far as the gate | she hesitated more |  yes that is so | but if i take it outside i can never return it |  why not |  i cannot tell | i am afraid |  you can talk freely | nothing that you say shall go to other ears | if you bring me news of value you will be well rewarded and no one shall know | catharine loved the major | presently she told him of the mind of pontiac and the deed planned for tomorrow morning | a cold fear clutched the heart of major gladwyn | he recalled the shortened guns he recalled the bloody belt he recalled the date made with him for a big council on the morrow | at last he rather believed | so he sent away the trembling catharine that she might go to her village | he held a council with his officers | here they were with only one hundred and twenty soldiers and less than three weeks' provisions cut off by one thousand two thousand three thousand merciless indian warriors and by the french settlers and traders who probably would be glad to have the english killed |  the english are to be struck down but no frenchman is to be harmed had said catharine | that looked bad indeed | this night guards were doubled along the parapets and in the block houses | the major himself walked guard most of the night | from the distant villages of the ottawas the wyandots and the potawatomis drifted the clamor of dances an ugly sound full of meaning now | precisely at ten o'clock in the morning a host of bark canoes from the ottawa side of the detroit river slanted across the current and made landing | pontiac approached at the head of a long file of thirty chiefs and as many warriors | they walked with measured stately tread | every man was closely wrapped in a gay blanket | they were admitted through the gate of the fort but it was closed against the mass of warriors women and children who pressed after | as pontiac with his escort stalked for the council room his quick glances saw that the soldiers were formed under arms and moving from spot to spot and that a double rank had been stationed around the headquarters | in the council chamber he noted too that each officer wore his sword and two pistols |  why asked pontiac of major gladwyn do i see so many of my father's young men standing in the street with their guns |  it is best that my young men be exercised as soldiers or they will grow lazy and forget answered the major |ha  pontiac knew | somehow his plans had been betrayed his game was up unless he chose an open fight | his chiefs and warriors sat uneasily | they all feared death | by indian law they ought to be killed for having intended to shed blood in a calumet council | pontiac started his talk | he acted confused as though he was not certain what course to pursue | once he did seem about to offer the belt wrong end first as the signal and major gladwyn still sitting slightly raised his hand | instantly from outside the door sounded the clash of arms and the quick roll of a drum to show that the garrison was on the alert | the officers half drew their swords | pontiac flushed yet darker | he stammered and offering the belt right end first closed his talk and sat down again | major gladwyn made a short reply | he said that the english were glad to be friends as long as their red brothers deserved it but any act of war would be severely punished | that was all | the major let the indians file out again | pontiac knew | he was too great a leader in the indian way to be balked by one defeat | he actually proposed another council he actually persuaded the foolish major to send out to him two officers for a peace talk | one of the officers barely escaped from captivity the other never came back | then pontiac boldly besieged detroit in white race fashion the closest longest siege ever laid by indians against any fort on american soil | his two thousand indians swarmed in the forest held the fences and walls and buildings of the fields peppered the palisade with bullets and arrows shot fire into the town captured a supply fleet in the river ambushed sallying parties cut to pieces a column of reinforcements | the siege lasted six months | the orders to attack went out | on may 16 fort sandusky at lake erie in northern ohio was seized by the wyandots and ottawas during a council | on may 25 fort st joseph of st joseph michigan on lake michigan across the state from detroit was seized in like manner by the potawatomis | on may 27 fort miami near present fort wayne of indiana commanded by ensign holmes who had discovered the bloody belt was forced to surrender to the wyandots | ensign holmes himself was decoyed into the open and killed | on june 4 populous michilimackinac of northern michigan was pillaged | the chippewas and sacs celebrated the king's birthday in honor of the english with a great game of lacrosse in front of the post | michilimackinac did not know that detroit was being besieged | the gates were left open the officers gathered to witness the game | the ball was knocked inside the palisades the players rushed after and that was the end of michilimackinac | on june 15 the little fort of presq' isle near the modern city of erie on the lake erie shore of northern pennsylvania was attacked | it was captured in two days by the ottawas and potawatomis from detroit | on june 18 fort le boeuf twelve miles south of it was burned | just when fort venango farther south fell to the senecas no word says for not a man of it remained alive | june 1 fort ouatanon below lafayette on the wabash river in west central indiana had surrendered | niagara in the east was threatened fort legonier forty miles southeast of pittsburg in pennsylvania was attacked by the delawares and shawnees but held out the strong fort pitt now pittsburg with garrison of over three hundred soldiers and woodsmen was besieged by the united delawares shawnees wyandots and mingo iroquois | a second bloody belt had been dispatched by pontiac from detroit as fast as it arrived the allies struck hard | of twelve fortified english posts eight fell | not only that but the fiery spirit of pontiac had aroused twenty two tribes extending from canada to virginia and from new york to the illinois | a hundred english traders were murdered in camp and on the trail | a thousand english are supposed to have been killed | five hundred families of northern virginia and of western maryland fled for their lives | while this work was going on and the frontier settlements shuddered and feared the morrow pontiac was sternly sticking to his siege of fort detroit | the french around there complained to him that his men were robbing them of provisions and injuring the corn fields |  you must stand that rebuked pontiac |  i am fighting your battles against the english | he gave out receipts for the supplies as taken | these receipts were pieces of bark pictured with the kind of supplies taken and signed with the figure of an otter the totem of the ottawas | after the war every receipt was honored by payment | only his ottawas were still fighting detroit when on october 30 this 1763 there arrived from the french commander on the lower mississippi a peace belt and a messenger for pontiac | he had been told that peace had been declared between the french and the english but he had not believed | now he was told again by word direct that the king of france and the king of england had signed peace papers the country was english his father the king of france could not help him | he must stop his war and take the english by the hand | weeks before this the indians to the south had withdrawn his other allies were fading into the forest | so sullen and disappointed he too withdrew | his sun had set but he tried to follow it southwestward | before he gave his hand to the english he did attempt another war | the tribes of the illinois hesitated in council |  if you do not join my people thundered pontiac i will consume you as the fire eats the dry grass of the prairies | the plot failed but the illinois did not forget his insulting words | in april 1769 while leaving a council with the illinois beside the mississippi river and wearing a blue and silver uniform coat given to him years before by the brave general montcalm of the french he was murdered by a kaskaskia of the illinois nation in the forest which became east st louis | the kaskaskia had been bribed by an english trader with a barrel of whiskey to do the deed | there died pontiac | he was buried it is said on the site of the present southern hotel in st louis city | the illinois suffered from this foul crime | all of pontiac's loyal people the ottawas the potawatomis the sacs the foxes the chippewas rose against them and swept them from the face of the earth | now what of catharine who saved detroit from pontiac | she saved detroit but fort detroit did not save her | pontiac was no fool he very quickly had suspected her | he well knew that major gladwyn was her friend and that she had taken the moccasins in to him | she was seized by the chief beaten almost lifeless with a lacrosse racquet and condemned to the meanest of labor | after the siege major gladwyn made no effort to rescue her or reward her | at last when an old and miserable woman she fell into a kettle of boiling maple sap and died | his name was the english one of john logan | he was a mingo or iroquois of a cayuga band that had drifted south into east central pennsylvania | there chief shikellemus his father had settled and had proved himself a firm friend of the whites | old shikellemus invited the moravian missionaries to take refuge on his lands | he spoke good english | he acted as agent between his people and the province of pennsylvania | he was hospitable and shrewd and ever refused to touch liquor because as he said he did not wish to become a fool | his house was elevated on stilts as protection against the big drunks | about 1725 a second son was born to him and his wife and named tah gah jute meaning his eye lashes stick out or open eyes | in admiration of his good friend james logan of philadelphia secretary of pennsylvania and sometimes acting governor chief shikellemus gave little tah gah jute the english name of logan | as john logan he was known to the settlers | the wise and upright shikellemus died in the fear of the lord | his people scattered wider | logan his son moved westward to the shawnee and delaware country of pennsylvania | here he married a shawnee girl | he set up housekeeping and traded venison and skins with the white settlers for powder ball and sugar and flour | the tide of white blood was surging ever farther into the west and the indians' hunting grounds | many of the indians grew uneasy | pontiac's bloody belt passed from village to village but the weary and nervous traveler was always welcome at the cabin of logan friend of the white man | a white hunter brown trailing bear in the pennsylvania timber laid aside his rifle and stooped to drink at a spring | suddenly he saw mirrored in the clear water the tall figure of an armed indian watching him | up he sprang leaped for his gun leveled it but the indian smiled knocked the priming from his own gun and extended his hand | this was logan the best specimen of humanity i ever met with red or white wrote brown |  he could speak a little english and told me there was another white hunter a little way down the stream and guided me to his camp | other stories of logan's kindnesses to the whites in his country are told | in the latter part of 1763 a party of white settlers had broken in upon the refuge of twenty conestoga iroquois in southern pennsylvania and killed every one | the conestogas were kin to the other mingos but logan made no war talk about it | simon kenton one of the most famous scouts of daniel boone's time in kentucky and ohio says that his form was striking and manly his countenance calm and noble | although logan started out to walk the straight path of peace sore days were ahead of him | he moved westward again in 1770 erected a cabin at the mouth of beaver creek on the ohio side of the ohio river about half way between pittsburg of pennsylvania and wheeling of west virginia | his cabin was kept wide open | everybody spoke well of logan | he removed once more | the new cabin home of the white man was built on the sciota river of central ohio among the shawnees of chief cornstalk's tribe | he and chief cornstalk were close friends | they both stood out for peace | but cornstalk had been a war chief also during the pontiac up rising | he and his warriors had obeyed the bloody belt | his name cornstalk meant that he was the support of the shawnee nation | now the evil days of logan were close at hand | since the treaty signed with the twenty two tribes of pontiac in 1765 there had been general peace between the red men and the white men in america | this peace was not to continue | for instance bald eagle a friendly old delaware chief who frequently came in by canoe to trade for tobacco and sugar was killed without cause by three white men in southern pennsylvania | they propped him sitting in the stern of his canoe thrust a piece of journey cake or corn bread into his mouth and set him afloat down the stream | many settlers who knew him well saw him pass and wondered why he did not stop for a visit | finally he was found to be dead and was brought ashore for burial | there were bad indians too who murdered and stole | for this the good indians suffered | western pennsylvania and eastern ohio were a wild and lawless country | up to 1774 these tit for tats had not brought on war | but the french of canada and the great lakes country still secretly urged the indians to drive out the settlers | the americans were becoming annoyed by the harsh laws of the english king | there were english officials who desired an indian war | that would give the colonists something else to think about | lord dunmore royal governor of virginia was one of these officials | he had claim to land extending into pennsylvania fort pitt at present pittsburg was garrisoned by virginia troops and he wanted to keep them there to help his land schemes | april 25 1774 he issued a proclamation calling upon the commander at fort pitt to be ready to repel the indians | the commander called on the border settlers | there was great excitement | almost at once the peace chain that logan had received from his father shikellemus was broken | he and his wife and relatives and a number of shawnees and delawares were encamped along yellow creek | this emptied into the ohio river a few miles below beaver creek his former home | on the very day after the commander at fort pitt had issued his notice to the border people to arm from wheeling on the ohio in west virginia captain michael cresap led a party of militia and frontiersmen to hunt indians | they promptly killed two friendly shawnees at pipe creek fourteen miles below wheeling | the shawnees had no time in which to make resistance | the next indians who were attacked fired back one white man was wounded | among the indians killed in these two meetings was a relative of logan | captain cresap started north to wipe out chief logan's camp | he well knew that as soon as the word of the killings reached the camp trouble might break | on the way his heart failed him | he was a hot headed man he hated indians but he balked at shooting women and children | so he turned aside with his party | there were white men not so particular as he | on baker's bottom opposite the mouth of yellow creek lived joshua baker whose principal business was that of selling rum to the indians | in the same settlement lived daniel greathouse a ruffian in human shape and an enemy to all indians | greathouse too was inspired to strike the post in the worst indian fashion | he gathered thirty two whites and hid them in baker's house | he feared that the logan camp had heard of the cresap killings so he crossed over the river to investigate | a friendly squaw warned him to go back or he might be harmed for the camp was very angry | back he went | because he was afraid to attack the camp with his thirty two men he invited the indians over to drink peace with him | he was a rum seller himself | on april 30 they came | first a canoe containing six warriors logan's sister another woman and a little girl | the warriors were made drunk and all but the little girl were butchered | across the river logan heard the shooting | he sent two men in a canoe to find out what was the matter | they were killed | a larger canoe was sent | it was ambushed and the survivors fled back to the camp | now logan learned that his sister and brother had been murdered | they were the last of his blood relatives | that was his reward for having remained the friend of the white man | that was his reward for having opened his cabin to the white wayfarer | he went bad himself | he saw only red and he vowed vengeance | a bitter wrath turned his heart sour | he felt that he must grasp the hatchet buried so long ago by his father shikellemus | the war spirit blazed high among whites and reds on the frontier | the whites accused the indians of many thoughts and deeds some false some true | the indians accused the whites of many deeds mainly true | block houses were hastily erected for the protection of settlers | governor dunmore of virginia called out troops in earnest |  dunmore's war as well as cresap's war was this named | the shawnees the delawares the mingo cayugas the wyandot hurons held councils in their scioto river country of central ohio | belts were sent to the miamis on the west and the senecas on the east | there were debates upon striking the long knives as the virginians were called | these long knife americans had crossed the rivers and the mountains were possessing themselves of ohio and even of kentucky much blood had been shed and the wiser heads among the tribes did not know exactly what to do about it | the great cornstalk loved chief of the shawnees and now fifty years in age lifted his voice for peace | he could see no good in a war against the americans | logan gnawed by his own wrongs remained apart and said little | but the americans struck first | hoping to keep the indians at home in june four hundred border men were ordered by governor dunmore of virginia to attack the villages in ohio | they marched west across country until in southern ohio they destroyed two shawnee towns | the light skinned shawnees were known as the fiercest most stubborn fighters among all the algonquins between the alleghanies and the mississippi river | now their hot natures burst | chief cornstalk yielded |  it is well he said |  if you go to war then i will lead you | if we fight at all we must fight together | but of the indians it was logan who first struck the long knives | with only seven warriors he suddenly appeared in virginia itself | this was long knife country | here july 12 he fell upon william robinson thomas hellen and coleman brown three settlers who were gathering flax in their field | brown died under the first volley hellen and robinson ran hard | hellen was an old man and easily caught but william robinson was young and strong | dodging and legging he had almost reached the timber | hearing loud shouting with english words behind him and fearing a rifle bullet he turned his head and lunged full tilt into a tree | down he dropped stunned | after a bit he came to | he was lying securely tied hands and feet | logan was sitting quietly beside him waiting for him to waken | the old man hellen had not been harmed either | logan's party took their two captives to logan's town in ohio treated them kindly on the way |  what will be done to us at your town | asked robinson |  you will be made to run the gauntlet answered logan |  but if you listen to my words you will not be hurt | you must break through the lines and run to the council house | when you are in the council house you will be safe | that will end the gauntlet | approaching the mingo and shawnee towns logan uttered a terrific scalp halloo as signal of success | warriors hastened out | the gauntlet was formed | this was two lines of warriors squaws and children armed with sticks clubs and switches | through the long narrow living aisle the two prisoners had to make their way | remembering logan's advice robinson charged aside broke through and raced for the council house | all out of breath he reached it ahead of his howling pursuers | no indian dared to attack him there | it was sanctuary | poor old mr hellen failed | the lines were stout the clubs and switches blinded him before he had reached the council house a war club struck him helpless | he might have been beaten to death had not robinson bravely grabbed him and dragged him in | he had won his life and was adopted into an indian family | now the indians were angry with robinson | they decided to burn him at the stake |  have no fear | you shall not die asserted logan | but matters looked bad | he was tied to the stake | while he stood there with the squaws howling around him he heard logan speak appealing for his life |  the most powerful orator i've ever listened to afterward said robinson |  his gestures and face were wonderful | the warriors still called for fire | the torch was ready when logan sprang angrily forward | with his own hatchet he cut the ropes and marching the white captive through the mob landed him in the lodge of an old squaw | few chiefs would have dared an act like this to save merely a white man and an enemy | however logan was not yet done | thirteen of his people he claimed had been killed by the whites and thirteen white scalps should pay | just before he set out on the war path again he brought to william robinson a goose quill and some gun powder | he bade robinson sharpen the quill and with gunpowder and water for ink write a letter | this note was carried clear down into western virginia as if to show how far logan could reach | it was found tied to a war club and left at a plundered settler's cabin | logan never would believe but that michael cresap had killed the warriors and women at yellow creek | when captain cresap heard of this note and that he was blamed he said that he would like to sink his tomahawk in daniel greathouse's head | chief logan was not long in getting his thirteen scalps |  now he announced i am satisfied | my relations have been paid for | i will sit still | he was not to sit still yet | the hands of the shawnees grasped the hatchet very firmly | forty scalps at a time had been hung in the shawnee lodges but the spirits of their fathers and the ashes of their towns called for more | the delawares had not taken payment enough for the scalp of old bald eagle | the senecas remembered that many years ago eight of their warriors were attacked by one hundred and fifty long knife soldiers | the mingos had not forgotten the massacre of the conestogas | the wyandots were red and hated the white face in the east | these nations formed the league of the northern confederacy to defend themselves | cornstalk the shawnee was chosen head chief | he brought word that far across the ohio river in north western now west virginia he and his comrade had met a great column of long knives advancing over the mountains as if to invade the indian country | his comrade had been killed | he himself had come back with the word | taking eleven hundred warriors the pick of the shawnees the fighting delawares the wyandots the mingo cayugas and the mingo senecas chief cornstalk marched rapidly down to give battle | there really were two american columns on their way to destroy the shawnee and mingo towns in interior ohio | the division of northern and western virginia twelve hundred men had mustered at fort pitt pittsburg pennsylvania in the territory disputed by virginia and pennsylvania | it was under command of lord dunmore himself governor of virginia for the king of england | the division of southern and eastern virginia fifteen hundred men had mustered at lewisburg west virginia | it was under command of general andrew lewis a valiant soldier | the lord dunmore division was to march south the general lewis division was to march west the two were to join forces at point pleasant where on the border of west virginia the big kanawha river empties into the noble ohio | cornstalk moved fast | he had as aides logan of the cayugas chi ya wee of the wyandots scop pa thus of the senecas young red hawk of the fighting delawares his own son el li nip si co noted chiefs all | among the shawnee sub chiefs was puck ee shin wah father of a boy named tecumseh who grew to the greatness of pontiac | the general lewis division had arrived first at the mouth of the big kanawha | on the evening of october 9 from the opposite side of the ohio cornstalk's and logan's men sighted them there in camp | fresh news had come to cornstalk | he had learned of the other division under lord dunmore | he had learned that the column across from him was equal to his own force and that another detachment of it was hurrying on its trail | in a council of the chiefs and principal warriors he proposed that he go over in person and treat for peace | but all his men voted him down |  very well he replied |  if you are resolved to fight then fight you shall | we must not delay | it is likely that we shall have hard work tomorrow but if any warrior attempts to run away i will kill him with my own hand | this night the warriors ferried the ohio above the camp by means of seventy eight rafts | they worked hard and formed for battle at daybreak |  we will make a line behind the long knives ordered cornstalk and drive them forward like bullocks into the two rivers | most of the virginians were asleep in their tents when before sunrise two of their hunters seeking deer for breakfast found the indian army already in battle array and covering as one of the hunters excitedly reported four acres of ground | but these virginians were no fools | of the eleven hundred here wellnigh every man had been a buckskin borderer deadly with rifle tomahawk and knife and up to all indian tricks | they were fairly drilled too as militia | a number of the officers had fought under major george washington when on the fatal braddock's field in 1755 the american rangers had tried to save the day from the french and from pontiac's whooping warriors | they all had marched for five weeks across one hundred and sixty miles of trackless mountain country driving their pack horses and their herds of beef cattle now they rallied briskly to save their lives | it was nip and tuck | from before sunrise until sunset raged the great battle of point pleasant or the big kanawha | it was the first pitched battle between simon pure americans but the revolution was near and after this the americans were to do their own fighting | the lines were over a mile long rarely more than twenty yards apart frequently less than six yards apart and sometimes mingling | the armies were equal | both sides fought indian fashion from behind trees and brush | rifle met rifle tomahawk met tomahawk knife met knife | the air was filled with whoops and cheers | able chiefs faced able chiefs on the white american side there were leaders who soon became more famous in the revolution and in the history of the new nation | it was a long famous battle | a ballad written upon it was frequently sung on the frontier: let us mind the tenth day of october seventy four which caused woe the indian savages they did cover the pleasant banks of the o hi o | the battle beginning in the morning throughout the day it lashed sore till the evening shades they were returning upon the banks of the o hi o | seven score lay dead and wounded | of champions that did face their foe by which the heathens were confounded upon the banks of the o hi o |col  lewis and noble captains did down to death like uriah go | alas their heads wound up in napkins upon the banks of the o hi o | o bless the mighty king of heaven for all his wondrous works below who hath to us the victory given upon the banks of the o hi o | logan was seen here there everywhere | so was cornstalk | his mighty voice was heard above the din like the voice of old annawan when king philip had been surprised |  be strong | be strong | he appealed to his warriors | with his tomahawk he struck down a skulker | that had been his promise in the council | all this october day the battle continued | in single encounters man to man valorous deeds were done | cornstalk proved himself a worthy general | when his line bent back before the discipline of the long knives it was only to form an ambush and then the whites were bent back | he had early placed his warriors across the base of the point so that they held the whites in the angle of the two rivers | they dragged logs and brush to position as breast works |  we will drive the long knives into the rivers like so many bullocks | that was not to be | two of general lewis's colonels had fallen the indian fire was very severe and accurate but after vainly trying to feel out the end of the red line the general at last succeeded toward evening in sending a company around | chief cornstalk thought that this company appearing in his rear was the absent part of the division | lest he be caught between two fires he swung about and skillfully withdrew | the battle slackened at dusk | this night he safely removed his army across the ohio again that they might avoid the lord dunmore division and protect their towns in ohio | nearly all the indian bodies found and nearly all the virginians killed and wounded were shot in the head or the breast | that was the marksmanship and the kind of fighting | the long knives lost seventy five men killed and one hundred and fifty wounded | they lost two great chiefs: colonel charles lewis the brother of the general and colonel john field both braddock men six captains and as many lieutenants were killed also | the indians said that had they known how to clean their rifles they would have done better | cornstalk and logan lost the sub chief puck ee shin wah but only forty or fifty others in killed and wounded | but when they hastened for their towns they found them in danger from the lord dunmore column | governor dunmore sent chief white eyes of the delawares who had not joined in the war to ask chief cornstalk for a talk | chief white eyes returned with no answer for the cornstalk chiefs were in bitter council | cornstalk addressed them: you would not make peace before point pleasant what is your voice now when the long knives are pressing on in two columns | there was no reply |  we cannot save our villages he continued |  if your voice is for war let us first kill our women and children | then let us warriors go out and fight like men until we too are killed | still no reply | cornstalk dashed his hatchet into the council post |  you act like children he thundered |  i will go and make peace myself | and leaving his hatchet sticking in the post go he did | logan had not been here | he was away down in virginia scouting with his mingos and delivering his note to captain cresap | on october 21 he arrived with scalps | he refused to meet the governor |  tell the governor that i am a warrior not a councillor he bade | his sore heart was not yet healed | his mingos were for war | the revolution was brewing and governor dunmore was anxious to be about his own affairs | so he sought out logan with two messengers scout simon girty and trader john gibson who spoke the mingo tongue | not one | trader gibson reported that while making this speech logan wept | the sad hearted chief probably did not put his words in exactly this order but they made a great sensation | soon they were being repeated throughout all the ohio river country and east of the alleghanies in towns cabins and camps |  who is there to mourn for logan | would ask some voice in the circle | and another voice would reply with deep feeling: not one | president thomas jefferson included the speech in a book that he published notes on virginia and said that he challenged the orations of the world to produce anything better | it was copied into other books | school children memorized it for speaking day grown people used it in contests and for one hundred years it was the favorite platform piece | thus logan lived in the white man's words | still logan did not come in to the peace talk held with governor dunmore southeast of present circleville in south central ohio | the shawnees and delawares said: logan is like a mad dog | his bristles are up they are not yet fallen but the good talk may smooth them down | he stayed close in his cabin up the scioto river and cornstalk spoke for the shawnees delawares and wyandots | it was another great address | cornstalk told of the wrongs suffered by the indians in their hunting grounds how they were losing the lands of their fathers and were being cheated by the white men | he asked that nobody be permitted to trade on private account with the indians but that the government should send in goods to be exchanged for skins and furs and that no fire water should enter into the business for from fire water there comes evil | then he buried the hatchet | he never dug it up | when the revolution broke in 1776 and the british agents urged the indians to strike the post again and help their great father the king cornstalk held firm for friendship with the americans | in the spring of 1777 he and young red hawk the delaware and another indian came down to the american fort that had been built on the battle field of point pleasant at the mouth of the big kanawha of the west virginia border |  my shawnees are restless he warned |  the current sets so strongly against the americans that i fear my people will disobey me and float with the stream | captain matthew arbuckle was the commander of the fort | he kept the cornstalk party as hostages for the good behavior of the shawnees | cornstalk did not object but spent much time in talking with the officers and in kindly drawing maps of the ohio country for them | those brave words were not forgotten | this same day somebody shouted loudly from the opposite side of the ohio | it was the young chief ellinipsico | he had not known what had happened to his father and had traveled many miles seeking him | cornstalk called him over | there was much rejoicing in the reunion they loved each other dearly | on the very next day two soldiers named hamilton and gilmore went over the kanawha river to hunt | the majority of the ohio indians were now helping the british | some of the hostile warriors lurking in west virginia fired on the two men and killed gilmore | instantly the cry arose among the soldiers at the fort that ellinipsico had planned the ambush | ellinipsico denied it | he said that he had come alone on purpose to find his old father | but that made no difference | captain john hall and squad were returning in a canoe bearing the body of gilmore |  let us go and kill those indians in the fort | captain arbuckle and private stuart tried in vain to force them back | in their cabin of the fort the chief cornstalk party had been told by a white woman that they were in danger | they now heard the captain hall men approaching | young ellinipsico grew frightened but his father steadied him |  my son said cornstalk the great spirit has seen fit that we should die together and has sent you here to that end | it is his will and let us submit it is all for the best | he faced the door and stood calmly waiting | without a word or a struggle he fell dead pierced through the front by seven bullets | ellinipsico was now calm also | he did not even stand and thus he died not moving | he was a worthy son of cornstalk | young red hawk was a delaware and hoping to be spared he crept into the fire place chimney | but he was dragged out to death | the fourth indian fought with his hands and was cut to pieces | the murderers of the generous noble hearted cornstalk were never punished but they certainly were not admired | the white men who had met him in war and in peace mourned him as much as the red men did | and from that day the shawnee nation became the most deadly foe to the inhabitants of the frontiers | who may blame them | meanwhile logan was living in misery but he was soon to follow chief cornstalk | his end was far less happy | he had not been much heard from lately | after he had refused to meet the long knives in a peace talk the troops had destroyed some of his villages | he and a band of his mingos retreated northward toward the great lakes | the mingos aided the british but logan pursued fire water more frequently than he did war | he never got over his grief | it had bitten him too deeply and had poisoned his thoughts | still the good in him cropped out | when in 1778 the famous american scout simon kenton had been captured by the shawnees he was taken by the torture trail to the village in northern ohio where logan was living | he had little hopes but logan walked over to him |  well young man said logan in good english these other young men seem very mad at you |  yes sir they certainly are frankly answered simon kenton | already one arm had been almost cut from his shoulder by an axe | logan gravely smiled | that was the real spirit of logan | the two runners were sent and simon felt much encouraged | during the next day he was well treated in the village | he and logan talked together freely | in the evening the two runners returned | they went straight to logan's lodge but no word came to kenton | now he feared again | he feared more when in the morning logan himself approached him said only you are to be taken at once to sandusky gave him a piece of bread and whirling on his heel strode gloomily away | evidently the power of logan had weakened the shawnees had not listened and sandusky north on the sandusky river was waiting with the stake | so simon kenton journeyed unwillingly onward to be saved at the last moment by the british | but logan had done his best | after this he drank harder until his mind was injured | he had flashes of good and he had longer flashes of bad | he seemed bent upon doing as much harm to himself as he could | then in 1780 one day at detroit he thought that while drunk he had killed his shawnee wife | he imagined that he was being arrested and in the fight that he made he was shot dead by his own nephew on the road between detroit and sandusky | many mourned cornstalk |  who was there to mourn logan the friend of the white man |  not one | but the name logan was worn like a badge of honor by others in the mingo people | chapter x little turtle of the miamis 1790 1791 he wins great victories during the revolution by which the united states became an independent nation the great majority of the indian tribes within reach took active part on the side of the british | the iroquois fought out of friendship they said the tribes farther west fought in the hope of keeping the settlers out of the kentucky ohio and indiana country | for some years after the war which closed in 1782 there was a dispute between the united states and england over the carrying out of certain terms in the treaty of peace | until the matter was settled the british kept detroit and other american frontier posts | this encouraged the indians | they had been much astonished and alarmed to find that the americans had laid the king on his back | now that the british had lost the fight what would happen to them | but the british agents and traders still in the indian country urged them on to make good their boast that no white cabin should smoke beyond the ohio | it was reported that the king was only resting and that the americans yet had no right to any land west of the ohio river | so the miamis the potawatomis the ottawas the shawnees the war delawares the chippewas the kickapoos the wyandots the senecas refused to meet the americans in council or to bury the hatchet | they formed a league of defense | the miamis were the central nation |  people who live on the peninsula was their chippewa name for they were algonquins from the chippewa and ottawa country north of the great lakes |  twanh twanh the cry of the crane was their own name | miamis from the chippewa word omaumeg were they called in english | they had been described by early travelers as a pleasant faced lively very polite people slow of speech swift of foot fond of racing and obedient to their chiefs | their present home was in the wabash river valley of northern indiana up as far as the modern city of fort wayne | they claimed this country and also all of western ohio where they formerly had lived | the shawnees and the wyandots of ohio had moved in behind them they said and were merely tenants upon their lands | little turtle or mich i kin i kwa had become their chief | he had been born on the eel river near fort wayne in 1752 | therefore now at the close of the revolution he was thirty years old | he had not been born a chief nor even a miami | to be sure his father was chief and a miami but his mother was a mohegan of the delawares | by indian law he had ranked as only a warrior and a mohegan | an indian was known by his mother | as a boy of eleven or twelve he had been stirred by the pontiac war in which the miamis had joined | as a warrior he had campaigned with the british under general burgoyne who surrendered at saratoga | so by his deeds and his experience in field camp and council he was a veteran and had won the chieftainship of the twelve hundred miamis | although his name was little turtle he had nothing little in his make up | on the contrary he was of good size strong and dignified with a long face and full high forehead not the face or forehead of a miami | he seems to have been rather sarcastic and unpopular | those were bloody days while the new united states was trying to extend across the ohio river | a treaty was made with the cherokees and chickasaws of the south and with the six nations of the north one was supposed to have been made with these ohio country tribes also | these indians said that they would do nothing for peace until they had talked with their british father at detroit | they were not sure that the king had really surrendered their lands beyond the ohio | they asserted that their treaty by which they had sold their lands had not been signed by the proper chiefs | in the seven years since the end of 1782 some two thousand american settlers and traders had been killed or captured along the ohio river twenty thousand horses had been stolen | the rifle was more necessary than the ax and plough | the miami villages on the northern border between ohio and indiana formed the base for the many war parties | so in 1790 president george washington and congress ordered general arthur saint clair the governor of this northwest territory to clear the land for the smoke of the white cabins | little progress had been made by the white settlements across the ohio river | there were only two of any note: marietta named for the french queen marie antoinette and the newer cincinnati christened in 1790 by governor saint clair himself | there were several smaller ones struggling to live | the governor called for regulars and militia | general josiah harmar the commander in chief of the united states army was detailed in charge | on october 3 he started from fort washington at cincinnati with three hundred and twenty regulars of the first infantry and eleven hundred and thirty three militia of kentucky and pennsylvania to destroy the towns of little turtle the miami | little turtle of course soon knew all about this | his spies infested the region | he rallied his bands | the indians whom he commanded ottawas potawatomis chippewas shawnees senecas delawares miamis and so forth were the same nations that had obeyed the bloody belt of pontiac | he had able aides too the skilled buc kon ga he las of the delawares blue jacket of the shawnees and others great fighters every one | white men also were helping him | there were three especially: simon girty matthew elliott and alexander mckee who was part indian | they were three traitors who had deserted from the american garrison at fort pitt in 1778 and had spread false reports among white eyes' delawares and elsewhere | serving the enemies of their country they had continued to live among the shawnees and wyandots and in their savagery were worse than the indians | their names are red on the pages of history | in chief little turtle's main village sometimes called girty's town located a few miles southeast of present fort wayne indiana there was another white man a young man | his name had been william wells but now was black snake | the indians had captured him when a little boy in kentucky he had grown up with the miamis had married chief little turtle's sister and was rated as a miami warrior | but his heart was not bad | they both were veterans of the revolution had good fighters under them and might be thought well matched | but the general got threshed | little turtle waited for him to come on and plagued his march with parties of scouts who in the swamps and thickets cut off his foraging squads | the general had tough going for two weeks | when on october 17 he arrived at girty's town he found it abandoned and burning to deprive him of more supplies | then general harmar made his first mistake | he detached thirty of the first infantry regulars under captain john armstrong and one hundred and fifty of the militia under colonel john hardin of kentucky to follow the retreating indians and perhaps destroy the next village | he played into the hands of little turtle who had over a thousand warriors | colonel hardin and captain armstrong had marched scarcely six miles when in an open place they were completely ambushed | a swarm of indians suddenly poured in a heavy fire from the brush on all sides rose and charged with tomahawk and knife | this was too much for the militia who were poorly drilled | away they pelted trying to reach the main army | but the well drilled regulars stood stanch and met the tomahawk with the bayonet in the hope of forcing a passage | the little turtle warriors cared nothing about the militia and let them go | the few regulars did not last long | every soldier except two officers and two privates was killed | of these two officers in the break up ensign asa hartshorne of connecticut fortunately stumbled over a log and lay concealed until he might escape | captain armstrong crouched to his neck in a swampy pond and stayed there all night while only two hundred yards from him the enemy held a war dance over the bodies of the slain | they had whipped the trained soldiery who had fought bravely | the next day with all his army general harmar advanced upon the miami towns | little turtle had ordered them burned | the general destroyed the corn fields and the fruit trees and seeing no indians to fight turned back for fort washington | he had gone about ten miles when scouts brought word that the indians were gathering in their towns again | the general made a second mistake | colonel hardin stung by the way in which his militia had acted begged for another chance | instead of going himself general harmar again detached some of the militia six hundred this time and sixty of the regulars under major john p wyllys of washington's old continentals | he told colonel hardin to find the indians | the colonel found them on the morning of october 22 | his only fear had been that they would run off and not give him his revenge | but he had not counted the strategy of little turtle | when the first few indians were sighted colonel hardin made careful and scientific preparation | he attacked | the indians did run off with the happy shouting militia in full hue and cry after | the regulars followed slowly | when a gap of two miles had opened as if from the very earth out sprang little turtle's whole remaining force a thousand and the hapless regulars were in the same plight as before | the militia fought their way back too late | the battle on the field had become hand to hand | both sides were brave but when a soldier thrust with his bayonet two tomahawks were there to crash into his skull | major wyllys was killed so was lieutenant ebenezer frothingham fifty of the rank and file fell | only eight men escaped | of the militia a major two captains and over ninety others died | after he had been joined by the survivors general harmar resumed his march to fort washington | he claimed a victory because he had destroyed the indians' winter supplies but he had lost one hundred and eighty three soldiers killed and forty wounded and the indians not more than fifty warriors | the victory and the field of battle were left to little turtle | general harmar had proved to be a commander whose orders were go instead of come and colonel hardin had not known how to fight indians | however little turtle realized that the americans had other officers and that general washington was not a man to back down there would be another army | so he spent much of the winter in visiting various tribes and enlisting them | he went as far north as ontario of canada and there appealed to the missisauga nation of algonquins | he traveled west to the illinois river | he was a second pontiac | general and governor saint clair himself was the officer appointed by president washington to lead the next expedition against the little turtle army | he was a gallant old continental aged fifty seven and gray haired | as a young officer in a scotch regiment he had come over to america with a british army in 1758 to fight the french and indians | after that war he had become a true american citizen of pennsylvania and as colonel and major general had served with the buff and blue in the war for american independence | he had been unlucky in his campaigns but nobody ever doubted his courage | general washington thought highly of him and now took pains to say in person to him before the start was made: beware of a surprise | you know how the indians fight | so i repeat beware of a surprise | general saint clair had been promised three thousand men but when early in september of this year 1791 he left fort washington he had only two thousand men | still it was a strong army comprising the greater portion of the whole army of the united states | i never have been ill a moment in all my life and strength never has failed me for work to which i set my hand |  the rapidly decreasing supply of drugs and the adulterated importations early taught me that the day was coming when it would be an absolute necessity to raise our home supplies | so while yet in my teens i began collecting from the fields and woods for miles around such medicinal stuff as grew in my father's fields marsh and woods and planting more wherever i found anything growing naturally in its prime | i merely enlarged nature's beds and preserved their natural condition | as the plants spread and the harvest increased i built a dry house on scientific principles a large store room and later a laboratory in which i have been learning to prepare some of my crude material for the market combining ideas of my own in remedies and at last producing one your president just has indicated that i come to submit to you as a final resort in certain conditions |  my operations now have spread to close six hundred acres of almost solid medicinal growth including a little lake around the shores of which flourish a quadruple setting of water loving herbs | occasionally he shifted his position or easily walked across the platform and faced his audience from a different direction | his voice was strong deep and rang clearly and earnestly | his audience sat on the front edge of their chairs and listened to something new with mouths half agape | a few times carey turned from the speaker to face the audience | he agonized in his heart that it was a closed session and that his wife was not there to hear and that the girl was missing it | by the bent backs and flying fingers of the reporters at their table in front he could see that to morrow the world would read the harvester's speech and if it were true that the little mother had shortened her days to produce him she had done earth a service for which many generations would call her blessed | for the doctor could look ahead and he knew that this man would not escape | the call for him and his unimpeachable truth would come from everywhere and his utterances would carry as far as newspapers and magazines were circulated | the good he would do would be past estimation | the harvester continued | he was describing the most delicate and difficult of herbs to secure | he was telling how they could be raised prepared kept and compounded | he was discussing diseases that did not readily yield to treatment pointing out what drugs were customarily employed and offering if any of them had such cases and would send to him to forward samples of unadulterated stuff sufficient for a test comparison with what they were using | he was walking serenely and surely into the heart of every man before him | just at the point where it was the psychological time to close he stopped and stood a long instant facing them and then he asked softly did any man among you ever see the woman to whom he had given a strong man's first passion of love slowly dying before him | one breathless instant he waited and then continued gentlemen i recently saw this in my own case | for days it was coming so at night i shut myself in my laboratory and from the very essence of the purest of my self compounded drugs i distilled a stimulant into which i put a touch of heart remedy a brace for weakening nerves a vitalization of sluggish blood | as i worked i thought in that thought which embodied the essence of prayer and when my day and my hour came and a man who has been the president of your honourable body and is known to all of you said it was death i took this combination that i now present to you and with the help of the almighty and a woman above the price of rubies i kept breath in the girl i love and to day she is at full tide of womanhood | he was respectfully listened to as a wise captain and he and little turtle carried the day |  but the gray haired general is always ready for a surprise attack |  all right | wait until the hour when he is not ready | then strike | under the direction of commander in chief little turtle in the darkness this night the indian army stole forward and was posted with as much skill as any white army | the miamis held the center the wyandots the delawares and the senecas held the right the ottawas the potawatomis the shawnees and others held the left | they were ready | they could hear the challenges of the alert sentries at the gray hair's camp | two hours before day break they heard the drums beating the reveille | the soldiers of the gray hair were on the watch | the light in the east broadened | securely hidden the little turtle army waited | they might see the dim tents of the militia advance guard camped a quarter of a mile this side of the creek | beyond where the main camp was under arms the smoke of the fires began to thicken | toward the time of sunrise the soldiers grew tired of standing in ranks | the dawn hour for surprise by indians had passed | trumpet and drum roll sounded for break ranks | having stacked their guns the soldiers gladly made for their tents or squatted around the breakfast fires | another day had begun without event | little turtle allowed fifteen minutes or so for the soldiers to settle and doze | then he gave the signal a half hour before sunrise | general saint clair was lying sick in his tent | there burst a distant rifle shot it was instantly followed by a crackling volley as from half a thousand rifles and an answering heavier volley from the muskets of the militia | struggling to don his blanket coat he limped out his gray queue ragged | the camp sprang to arms for officers and men knew their business but here came the militia like a drove of stampeded cattle legging frantically for shelter from a horde of whooping darting indians | the militia dived through the lines of the regulars into the very center of the camp and for a short period all was chaos | it was a furious fight | re forming their lines the regulars stood well | they checked the charge by a thunderous volley from the long barreled flint lock muskets the same as used at brandywine princeton and yorktown | the strategy of little turtle and his chiefs was excellent | they shifted the attack from point to point | they attacked both lines at once | they took advantage of every cover and constantly appeared closer | they killed every horse and every gunner of the artillery posted in the center | of the second infantry all the officers fell except two | general butler hastened bravely up and down the one line encouraging the troops general saint clair limped heroically up and down the other line | eight bullets pierced his clothing a lock of his hair was shorn off | general butler was shot twice and while he was sitting mortally wounded an indian rushed in and tomahawked him | general saint clair's army was being shot to pieces | he ordered bayonet charges but when these had cleared a little space the indians re appeared thicker than ever | their fire it is recorded was tremendous | the camp was entered and pillaged | some two hundred and fifty women among them the general's dashing daughter had come with the army and these suffered terribly | after three hours' battle the general ordered a final charge to open a way | pressing behind the bayonets the weary troops commenced a retreat of twenty nine miles to fort jefferson | the general on a poor pack horse insisted on bringing up the rear | out of his less than fourteen hundred soldiers thirty eight officers and six hundred men were killed or missing twenty one officers and two hundred and forty two men were wounded | fifty of the women had died | it was as bad as the defeat of general braddock's army in 1755 | for a year and a half the field was covered with bleaching bones | little turtle the missisauga chief and simon girty the white savage had directed the attack | after a pursuit of four miles seeing that the soldiers were on the run and throwing away guns knapsacks and all they called the chase off | it had been victory enough | they had captured seven pieces of cannon two hundred cattle many horses they returned to the villages with one hundred and twenty scalps strung on one pole and with three pack horses piled high with kegs of liquor | their own loss was stated to be fifty six | surely this was a great triumph for commander in chief little turtle | another american army as good a selection as had opposed the british themselves in many a battle of the revolution had been fairly outwitted and fairly defeated by indians | general anthony wayne was appointed to try next |  mad anthony soldiers and citizens had styled him because of his head long valor in the revolution | he was a good man for the job if he did not act too fast and get ambushed | he took his time | the army of the united states was reorganized into the legion of the united states | he was placed in command | there were four sub legions or corps each composed of artillery dragoons infantry and riflemen | the enlisted men wore round caps like helmets | the badge of the first sub legion was white binding with short plumes of white wool and black horse hair | the badge of the second sub legion was red binding with short plumes of red wool and white horse hair | the badge of the third sub legion was yellow binding with yellow wool and black horse hair | the badge of the fourth sub legion was green binding with green wool and white horse hair |  another defeat will be ruinous to the reputation of the united states had said president washington | with this in mind general wayne declared for drilling his troops hard at legionville below pittsburg | infantry artillery and cavalry were kept busy at target practice broad sword practice and battle formations | in the spring of 1793 he moved down to fort washington at cincinnati | on august 8 he marched north with two thousand troops the equal of any troops in the world to invade the country of the miamis | meanwhile there had been fighting but the warriors of little turtle showed no signs of letting up | a message from the british had told them that war with the united states was due this year and that the indians were expected to hold their ground | now the great warrior mad anthony was advancing | him the indians much respected | his reputation was known | they had named him black snake and big wind or whirlwind | from the methods with which he made his marches his men deployed in open order his dragoons sweeping the flanks his scouts before and every night's camp pitched early and surrounded by a log breast works they saw that he was wise | he established more forts | he erected a new one near the site of fort jefferson at greenville ohio and spent the winter there | he built fort recovery on the skull dotted field where general saint clair had been routed | there the wayne men defeated the little turtle men | the indians spent two nights in carrying off their dead and wounded | but the british from detroit had come southward and built another fort for themselves fort maumee at the maumee river rapids in northwestern ohio south of modern toledo | that was a rallying place for the allied indians and encouraged them | the big wind continued laying waste the villages and fields | he built fort defiance in the very heart of the miami country and proceeded down the maumee river toward the british fort | within seven miles of the british fort he built fort deposit | he had two thousand legionaries and eleven hundred mounted kentucky riflemen little turtle's army was being driven back upon the british fort and must fight or quit | so far the big wind had proved himself the master | by this time little turtle had lost his brother in law black snake or william wells whose blood was the white blood and who could no longer fire upon his race | when he had heard that another american army was on its way he had led little turtle apart |  i now leave your nation for my own people he had said |  we have been friends | we are friends yet until the sun is an hour higher | from that time we are enemies | then if you wish to kill me you may | if i want to kill you i may | william wells plunged into the forest and found general wayne | he became a valuable scout with the united states column | from fort deposit general wayne sent word to the miamis that they must make peace at once or be attacked | little turtle called a council | some of his men were dubious |  it is no use fighting that man | his eye is never shut they complained | little turtle himself was dubious | the council debated upon whether to try another saint clair surprise or to choose their ground and wait | blue jacket the shawnee was for fighting |  listen spoke little turtle |  we have beaten the enemy twice under separate generals | we cannot expect the same good fortune always | think well of it | something whispers to me that we could do well to treat with him | somebody accused little turtle of being afraid at last | that was enough | he objected no more and the council decided to form battle array and wait at presq' isle near the british fort | blue jacket took charge | it was good ground for defense | another big wind had passed through the timber and laid the trees crisscross in great confusion | amidst this maze little turtle blue jacket simon girty and the other leaders stretched three lines of warriors and half breeds in a front two miles long | their left rested at the river their right was protected by a thicket the british fort was behind them | the british commander had said that he would open his gates to them if they were again driven back | the big wind who never slept had not delayed | this morning of august 20 1794 he marched right onward in battle array | at noon he struck the fallen timbers at presq' isle | now he was mad anthony again | he made short work of the little turtle army of fifteen hundred | he sent his kentucky mounted riflemen against their right flank he sent his dragoon regulars against their left flank he sent his regular infantry in a bayonet charge straight through their center | they were not to fire a shot until the indians had broken cover then they were to deliver a volley and keep going so hard that the enemy would have no time to reload | for once little turtle's warriors did not stand | they feared this mad general | the trained infantry legionaries moved so fast that they outfooted the cavalry and they alone drove the warriors helter skelter back through the timber to the very walls of the british fort | there the mounted riflemen and the dragoons smote with their long knives or broad swords for the gates of the fort were not opened and the walls proved only a death trap | the battle of fallen timbers was over in about an hour | the americans lost thirty eight killed one hundred and one wounded | the loss of the miamis and their allies numbered several hundred | nine wyandot chiefs had been slain | their warriors were scattered their villages and corn fields were destroyed the british had not helped them united states forts occupied their best ground from the ohio river right through north to lake erie and the long war had ended | the miamis and eleven other nations signed a treaty of peace at greenville in august of the next year 1795 |  i am the last to sign said little turtle and i think i will be the last to break it | ever after this little turtle lived at peace with the americans | the united states built him a house on his birthplace at the eel river twenty miles from fort wayne indiana | he tried to adopt civilization and bring his people to agriculture and prosperity | he was opposed by jealous chiefs who envied him his house and accused him of having been bought by the americans | but he was wiser than they | he had been the first of the great chiefs to frown upon the torture of captives give him a good mark for that | now he frowned upon liquor | with captain william wells his friend he appeared before the kentucky legislature and asked for a law against selling liquor to the indians | in the winter of 1801 1802 he asked to be vaccinated at washington and took some of the vaccine back with him for his people | he frequently visited philadelphia | there he met the famous polish patriot kosciusko | they had many talks | kosciusko presented him with a fine pair of pistols and a valuable otter skin robe | chief little turtle died july 14 1812 while on a visit at fort wayne | the notice in a newspaper said: perhaps there is not left on this continent one of his color so distinguished in council and in war | his disorder was the gout | he died in a camp because he chose to be in the open air | he met death with great firmness | the agent for indian affairs had him buried with the honors of war | his portrait painted by a celebrated artist was hung upon the walls of the war department at washington | one was lieutenant william henry harrison aged twenty one of the americans | the other was sub chief tecumseh aged twenty six of the shawnees | they were the sons of noted fathers | benjamin harrison the father of lieutenant harrison had been a famous patriot and a signer of the declaration of independence in 1776 | puck ee shin wah the father of tecumseh also had been a patriot he had died for his nation in the battle of point pleasant in 1774 when chief cornstalk fought for liberty | at the fallen timbers lieutenant harrison was an aide to general wayne young tecumseh was an aide to blue jacket | the two did not meet but their trails were soon to join | the name tecumseh pronounced by the indians tay coom tha means one who springs or darts | it was a word of the shawnees' great medicine panther clan or meteor clan therefore tecumseh has been known as crouching panther and shooting star | he was born in 1768 at the old shawnee village of piqua on mad river about six miles southwest of present springfield ohio | his mother may have been a creek or cherokee woman who had come up from the south with some of the shawnees | the shawnees were a southern people once | the mother's name was me tho a tas ke | tecumseh had five brothers and one sister | two of his brothers were twins and at least two besides his father fell in battle while he was still young | he had not been old enough to go upon the war trail with his father and head chief cornstalk but his elder brother chee see kau went and fought the long knives at point pleasant | when he came back he took little tecumseh in charge to train him as a warrior | when tecumseh was nineteen he and chee see kau with a party of other braves went upon a long journey of adventure south to the cherokee country of tennessee | it is said that the mother me tho tas ke already had left to return to the cherokees | likely enough the two brothers planned to visit her | they swung far into the west to the mississippi and circled to the cherokees | here ohee see kau was killed while helping the cherokees fight the whites | he was glad to die in battle i prefer to have the birds pick my bones rather than to be buried at home like an old squaw | tecumseh stayed in the south three years fighting to avenge his brother who had been a father to him and whose spirit still urged him to be brave | he got home to ohio just in time | in league with the little turtle miamis war chief blue jacket's shawnees had defeated the american general harmar and every warrior was needed | tecumseh had left as a young brave he returned as a young chief | he was sent out with a party to spy upon the march of the gray haired general saint clair | he did good work but he missed the big battle | but he was at the fallen timbers | here in the excitement when the american infantry came scrambling and cheering and stabbing through the down trees he rammed a bullet into his rifle ahead of the powder and had to retreat |  give me a gun and i will show you how to stand fast he appealed to the other indians | he was given a shot gun | the white soldiers were too strong his younger brother sau wa see kau was killed at his side and he must fall back again | this hurt his heart | when the treaty with general wayne was signed the next year he did not attend | blue jacket his chief afterwards sought him out and told him all about it: that the indians had surrendered much land | for some years the peace sun shone upon the ohio country | tecumseh was careful to cast no red shadow | he bore himself like an independent chief gathered his own band of shawnees married a woman older than himself lived among the delawares and spent much time hunting | he became known for his ringing speeches in the councils no indian was more eloquent | he was handsome too a true prince: six feet tall and broad shouldered of active and haughty mien quick step large flashing eye's and thin oval indian face with regular features | his face was the kind that could burn with the fire of his mind | in 1800 the northwest territory of which general saint clair had been the first governor was divided | the name northwest territory was limited to about what is now the state of ohio all west of that to the mississippi river was indiana territory | captain william henry harrison who had resigned from the army was appointed governor and indian commissioner of indiana territory | he moved to vincennes the capital on the lower wabash | chief tecumseh was living eastward on the white river | their trails were pointing in | two master minds were to meet and wrestle | the name of one of the two twins brothers of tecumseh was la la we thi ka meaning rattle or loud voice | he was not handsome | he was blind in the right eye and had ugly features | he was looked upon as a mouthy shallow brained drunken fellow of little account as a warrior | his band invited tecumseh's band to unite with them at greenville in western ohio where general saint clair's fort jefferson and general wayne's fort greenville had been built | then almost immediately or in the fall of 1805 loud voice arose as the prophet | while smoking his pipe in his cabin he fell backward in a pretended trance and lay as if dead | but before he was buried he recovered | he said that he had been to the spirit world | he called all the nation to meet him at wapakoneta the ancient principal village of the shawnees fifty miles northeast and listen to a message from the master of life | the message was a very good one | it was a great deal like the message of the delaware prophet as used by pontiac | the indians were to cease white man habits | they must quit fire water poison must cherish the old and sick must not marry with the white people must cease bad medicine making witch craft and tortures and must live happily and peacefully sharing their lands in common | as for him he had been given power to cure all diseases and to ward off death on the battle field | he changed his name to ten skwa ta wa the open door but is generally styled the prophet | his words created intense excitement | shawnees delawares and other indians came from near and far to visit him | tecumseh was very willing | it was a great thing to have a prophet for a brother and whether this was a put up job between them is to this day a mystery | but they were smart men | the prophet enlarged his rant | to the whites he proclaimed that he the open door tecumseh the shooting star and the other twin brother all had come at one birth | he asserted that their father had been the son of a shawnee chief and a princess daughter of a great english governor in the south | anybody whom he accused of witch craft was put to death | they usually were persons that he did not like | the delawares and shawnees killed old chiefs who were harmless and friends of the settlers | although the open door's teachings seemed to be for peace and prosperity among the indians they brought many indians together and aroused much alarm among the settlers of ohio and indiana territory | moreover the gatherings at greenville were upon ground that had been sold to the united states under the treaty after the battle of the fallen timbers | governor harrison sent a message to the delawares in the name of the seventeen fires the united states |  who is this pretended prophet who dares to speak for the great creator | the delawares listened even the shawnees were sickening of the witch craft fraud but the prophet seized upon an opportunity | in this 1806 an eclipse of the sun was due and he knew beforehand | perhaps he was told by british agents for the war of 1812 was looming and there was bad feeling between the two white nations |  the american governor has demanded of me a sign he proclaimed |  on a certain day i will darken the sun | and so he did | his fame spread like a wind | runners carried the news of him and of his power through tribe after tribe | he made long journeys himself | in village after village from the seminoles of florida to the chippewas of the canada border from the mingos of the ohio river to the blackfeet of the farthest upper missouri either he or some of his disciples appeared | they bore with them a mystic figure the size of the body of a man all wrapped in white cloth and never opened | this they tended carefully | they bore with them a string of white beans said to be made from the prophet's flesh | they preached that dogs were to be killed lodge fires were never to go out liquor was not to be drunk wars were not to be waged unless ordered by the prophet | each warrior was obliged to draw the string of beads through his fingers by this he shook hands with the prophet and swore to obey his teachings | it was rumored that within four years a great death would cover the entire land and that only the indians who followed the prophet would escape | these should enjoy the land freed of the white men | tecumseh bowed before his talented brother and had his own dreams dreams of a vast war league against the americans | the prophet was in control of eight or ten thousand warriors | the prophet's band at greenville increased to four hundred shawnees delawares wyandots chippewas and others a regular hodge podge | captain william wells who was the indian agent at fort wayne asked them to have four chiefs come in to listen to a message from their great father the president | on a sudden tecumseh took the lead as head chief | i shall expect him in six days from this time | captain wells then sent the message | the president asked the indians to move off from this ground which was not theirs | he would help them to select other ground | tecumseh replied hotly in a speech of defiance |  these lands are ours no one has a right to remove us because we were the first owners | the great spirit above knows no boundaries nor will his red people know any | if my father the president of the seventeen fires has anything more to say to me he must send a big man as messenger | i will not talk with captain wells |  why does not the president of the seventeen fires send us the greatest man in his nation | demanded the prophet |  i can talk to him i can bring darkness between him and me i can put the sun under my feet and what white man can do this | this month of may 1807 fifteen hundred indians had visited the prophet | they came even from the missouri river and from the rivers of florida | a general up rising of the tribes was feared | governor harrison worked sending many addresses | he could not stem the tide set in motion by the prophet and kept in motion by tecumseh |  my children appealed governor harrison this business must be stopped |  i am sorry that you listen to the advice of bad birds answered the prophet of the one eye and the cunning heart |  i never had a word with the british and i never sent for any indians | they came here themselves to hear the words of the great spirit | tecumseh also made speeches at the councils | once he spoke for three hours accusing the whites of having broken many treaties | some of his sentences the interpreter refused to translate they were so frank and cutting | the teachings of the prophet his brother were apparently all for peace and against evil practices such as drinking and warring and governor harrison could only wait watchfully | but he did not like the signs in the horizon | there were too many indians traveling back and forth | the war of 1812 with great britain was drawing nearer | the sacs and foxes of the mississippi country had accepted presents from the british | governor harrison was warned that the prophet and tecumseh had been asked to join | in the summer of 1808 the prophet moved his town to the north bank of the tippecanoe river on the curve where it enters the upper wabash river in northern indiana | he still had a following of shawnees chippewas potawatomis winnebagos and so forth | this was miami land shared by the delawares | they objected | but the prophet's town remained | in 1809 the united states bought from the miamis a large piece of territory which included this land | the prophet's people refused to move off | the great spirit had told them that the indians were to hold all property in common therefore no tribe might sell land without the consent of all the tribes | tecumseh was absent on a visit to other tribes | he asked the wyandots and the senecas to come to prophet's town on the tippecanoe | but the wyandots and the senecas had no wish to offend the united states again | they remembered that the british had not opened the gates of the fort to them when the big wind was blowing them backward you are painted too much my children they accused the british of saying and they were wary of tecumseh | he asked the shawnees of the upper country also to join him and the prophet | but they declined to meddle | old black hoof a chief whose memory extended back ninety years advised against it | the prophet was more clever than tecumseh | the wyandots were the keepers of the great belt which had bound the ohio nations together in little turtle's day | the prophet asked them if they still had it and if they the elder brothers would sit still while a few indians sold the land of all the indians | they replied they were glad to know that the belt had not been forgotten | let the indians act as one nation | they passed the belt to the miamis and the miamis were forced to obey | governor harrison was told that there were eight hundred warriors at the prophet's town and that vincennes was to be attacked | news of tecumseh came from here there everywhere | he seemed to be constantly traveling carrying the words of the prophet his brother | something was going on underneath the peace blanket | governor harrison and others of the whites read the puzzle in this wise: the peace blanket spread by the prophet to cover all red nations and make them one concealed a hatchet as the blanket of pontiac concealed a gun | the indians were to be increased and strengthened by right living and good habits until fitted to stand on their feet without aid | then all together as one nation they could strike for their country from the ohio river west to the missouri | tecumseh was to be the pontiac who would lead them | it was a scheme so wonderful so patient and so shrewd that the western whites might well gasp before it | the governor and tecumseh had never met | the prophet had been in vincennes several times to explain that he preached only peace which was true | but the town at the tippecanoe was getting to be a nuisance | horse thieves and murderers used it as a shelter and the authority of the united states was defied | a messenger sent there by the governor was threatened by the prophet with death | the message was sent to warn the brothers that the seventeen fires were surely able to defeat all the indians united and that if there were complaints these should be taken directly to the president | they say one land belongs to the miamis another to the delawares and so on but the great spirit intended it as the property of us all | our father tells us we have no right upon the wabash | the great spirit ordered us to come here and here we will stay | however tecumseh said that he remembered the governor as a very young man riding with general wayne and he would go to vincennes and talk with him | he probably would bring thirty of his men |  the governor may expect to see many more than that added the prophet | tecumseh brought not thirty but four hundred warriors painted and armed | attended by a small guard the governor stood to receive him on the broad columned porch of the official mansion | tecumseh with forty braves approached and halted | he did not like the porch he asked that the council be held in a grove near by |  your father says that he cannot supply seats enough there answered the interpreter |  my father | retorted tecumseh his head high |  the sun is my father the earth is my mother and on her bosom will i repose | in the grove he made a ringing fiery speech | he accused the united states of trying to divide the indians so as to keep them weak | he blamed the village or peace chiefs for yielding and said that now the war chiefs were to rule the tribes | he warned the governor that if the lands along the wabash were not given back to the indians the chiefs who had signed the sale would be killed and then the governor would be guilty of the killing | he threatened trouble for the whites if they did not cease purchasing indian land |  it is all nonsense to say that the indians are all one nation reproved governor harrison who was as fearless as tecumseh |  if the great spirit had intended that to be so he would not have put six different tongues into their heads | the miamis owned these lands in the beginning while the shawnees were in georgia | you shawnees have no right to come from a distant country and tell the miamis what shall be done with their property | tecumseh sprang up and angrily interrupted |  that is a lie | you and the seventeen fires are cheating the indians out of their lands | the warriors leaped up as if to attack | the few whites prepared for defense |  you are a man of bad heart thundered the governor to tecumseh |  i will talk with you no more | you may go in safety protected by the council fire but i want you to leave this place at once | other councils were held | tecumseh stood as firm as a rock for what he considered to be the rights of the indians | he was very frank | he said that if it were not for the dispute about the land he would continue to be the friend of the seventeen fires | he would rather fight with them than against them | he had no love for the british who clapped their hands and sicked the indians on as if they were dogs | as for making the indians one nation had not the seventeen fires set an example when they united | it was true he said that now all the northern tribes were one | soon he was to set out and ask the southern tribes to sit upon the same blanket with the northern tribes | the governor knew | from governor william clark of missouri he had received a letter telling him that friendship belts and war belts were passing among the nations west of the missouri river calling them to an attack on vincennes | the sacs of the upper mississippi had sent to canada for ammunition | from chicago had come word that the potawatomis and other tribes near fort dearborn were preparing | governor harrison had suggested that the two brothers travel to washington and talk with the president about lands | he himself had no power to promise that treaties should not be made with separate nations | he also said to tecumseh: if there is war between us i ask you to stop your indians from abusing captives and from attacking women and children | tecumseh promised but he went out upon his trip | before he left he asked that nothing should be done regarding the land before he came back a large number of indians were on the way to settle there and they would need it as a hunting ground | if they killed the cattle and hogs of the white people he would fix up everything with the president on his return | so in august of 1811 he left taking twenty warriors | with the fire brand of tongue and the burning mystery of his presence he kindled the nations of the south | he spoke in the name of the great prophet | he urged them all to join as one people and dam back the white wave that was seeking to swallow them | he told them that the prophet had stationed a lamp in the sky to watch them for him and sure enough a comet flamed in the horizon | to a creek chief in alabama he said: you do not mean to fight | i know the reason | you do not believe that the great spirit has sent me | you shall know | i go from here to detroit when i arrive there i will stamp on the ground with my foot and shake down all your houses | in december occurred an earthquake which destroyed new madrid town on the mississippi in southern missouri and was felt widely | the ground under the creek nation trembled | the creeks covered their heads and cried aloud: tecumseh has got to detroit | that was so | in december tecumseh really had got to detroit | but he had stamped his foot before time and he had not made the earth to tremble | he had stamped in wrath not at the creeks but at his own people | when he had left for the north he was ready to strike at any moment with five thousand warriors of north south and west | when he arrived home he found that his plans were shattered like a bubble he had no prophet and the former prophet had no town | he took nine hundred regulars and rangers to visit the prophet's town himself and see what was what | he camped within a mile of the sacred place on a timber island of the marshy prairie seven miles north east of the present city of lafayette indiana | during the darkness and early daylight of november 7 this 1811 he was attacked by the prophet's warriors | he roundly whipped them in the hot battle of tippecanoe | the prophet had brewed a kettle of magic by which he proclaimed to his warriors he had made one half of the american army dead and the other half crazy | during the attack he sat upon a high piece of ground and howled a song that should keep his warriors invisible and turn the bullets of the white men | but something was wrong with the kettle and something was wrong with the song for the americans fought hard when surprised and none seemed to be dead and of the one thousand shawnees winnebagos chippewas kickapoos forty were killed by the bullets and many more wounded | of the americans thirty seven were killed and one hundred and fifty two wounded | they pressed on to the town and burned it in spite of the great spirit |  you are a liar | accused a winnebago of the prophet |  you said that the white people were dead or crazy when they were all in their senses and fought like demons | when tecumseh arrived with his good news the indians were scattered | in his camp the prophet was being hooted at by even the children | tecumseh was so enraged with his brother for not having somehow kept the peace until the time for war was ripe that he seized him by the hair of the head and shook him until his teeth rattled | to governor harrison tecumseh announced that he was well minded for the visit with the president |  if you go you must go alone without any company of warriors replied the governor |  i am a great chief and i will not go in such a shameful fashion said tecumseh | so he went to canada instead | now the game was up | the prophet had proved to be no prophet from the great spirit | the indians felt cheated and were not afraid to speak boldly | councils were held by twelve tribes together | band opposed band | the delawares the miamis the kickapoos most of the wyandots were for peace with the americans and for letting the british alone | so were the potawatomis they accused the prophet of leading them falsely | captain elliott the traitor and british agent threatened to have the wyandots arrested for their talk | the band of canadian wyandots touched the british war hatchet so did tecumseh and the prophet | the war between the white people had commenced | between the logs brought a message to the canadian wyandots from head chief crane of all the wyandots | they were to come back to their hunting grounds | round head of the hostile wyandots spoke |  tell the american commander it is our wish that he should send more men against us | we want to fight in good earnest | the british agent captain elliott spoke |  tell my wife your american father that i want her to cook the provisions for me and my red children more faithfully than she has done | if she wishes to fight with me and my children she must not burrow in the earth like a ground hog | she must come out and fight fairly | between the logs answered valiantly in behalf of chief crane the wise man: brothers | i entreat you to listen to the good talk i have brought | if you doubt what i have said about the force of the americans you can send some of your people to examine it | the truth is your british father tells you lies and deceives you |  and now father i will bear your message to my american father | you compare the americans to ground hogs | i must confess that a ground hog is a hard animal to fight | he has such sharp teeth such a stubborn temper and such unconquerable spirit that he is truly a dangerous animal especially when in his own hole | but father you will have your wish | before many days you will see the ground hog floating on yonder lake paddling his canoe toward your hole and then you may attack him to suit yourself | this council was held at brownstown beside lake erie south of detroit | nobody cared anything about the prophet he was no warrior | but an invitation was sent to tecumseh in canada across the detroit river |  no he answered |  i have taken sides with the king my father and my bones shall bleach upon this shore before i will recross that stream to join in any good words council | the wyandots privately told between the logs that the most of them were being held prisoners by the british but that they accepted the belt from head chief crane and would return to the americans as soon as possible | and they did | tecumseh however had made up his mind | he was an honest enemy | there never was anything half way about tecumseh | his promised army of five thousand warriors had shrunk to less than one hundred only thirty of these were with him but he set about getting more | the prophet his brother was down at the fort wayne agency in indiana |  open door had partly explained away his failure in the battle of tippecanoe | his wife he said had touched his medicine and spoiled its power before the battle and he had not known | tecumseh sent a rider with word for the prophet to remove all the indian women and children to the mississippi and to bid the warriors strike vincennes | he himself would join if he lived in the country of the winnebagos which was wisconsin | delawares senecas chief crane's wyandots and the majority of the shawnees themselves refused to rise against the americans | the other indians waited for stronger signs | but they did not need to wait long | tecumseh's star became fixed in the sky he won the first battle of the war and won it for the british | commanding seventy indians and forty soldiers he whipped an american force at brownstown | in a second battle there although the americans were not captured it was tecumseh again who held his position longest | as reward he was promoted to brigadier general in the army of the king | the americans surrendered michilimackinac | the american big chief general hull retreated out of canada | runners from brigadier general tecumseh spread the news | the indians waited no longer | the potawatomis rose the miamis rose the ottawas and winnebagos and kickapoos rose | sioux of minnesota and sacs of illinois hastened forward | general tecumseh ruled | to the miamis and winnebagos was assigned the task of taking fort harrison near present terre haute of indiana to the potawatomis and ottawas aided by tecumseh and some english was assigned the task of taking fort wayne | but the shooting star's old foe william henry harrison was out upon the war trail again | he lifted the siege of fort wayne | the attack upon fort harrison also failed | from now on he and tecumseh fought their fight to a finish | this fall and winter of 1812 tecumseh traveled once more | from canada he journeyed south across a thousand miles of forest prairie and waters clear to the indians of georgia tennessee and alabama | he did not now come with word from any prophet to make the red people one nation and a better nation | he came as a british officer to bid the southern indians join the king's standard and fight the americans into the sea while he and the english did the same work in the north | he distributed bundles of red sticks for them to count one stick a day | with the last stick they were to strike | the creeks and cherokees were persuaded and strike they did | a bloody trail they made which many rains did not wash clean | back to the war in the spring of 1813 tecumseh brought into camp six hundred fresh warriors from the wabash | now two thousand fighting men obeyed his orders alone | his command frequently out numbered the british command | he was not a general in name only he knew military strategy he was an excellent judge of position admitted the british officers | he was consulted in the war councils | the british thought much of him the americans were obliged to think much about him | but the star of harrison also was marching on | the two stars came together in the trail | tecumseh with his indians and the british general proctor with his soldiers besieged the troublesome american general at fort meigs near by the battle field of fallen timbers | so again the two rival chiefs were face to face | an american detachment was surprised and captured | the indians commenced to kill and torture | general proctor looked on | tecumseh heard and rushed to the scene | he had given his word to general harrison two years ago and he was furious at the insult to his honor | defending the prisoners with knife and tomahawk he sprang for the british general |  who dares permit such acts |  sir your indians cannot be controlled | begone  roared tecumseh |  you are unfit to command go and put on petticoats | after that he openly despised general proctor | he sent a note in to his american foeman: general harrison: i have with me eight hundred braves | you have an equal number in your hiding place | come out with them and give me battle | you talked like a brave when we met at vincennes and i respected you but now you hide behind logs and in the earth like a ground hog | give me answer |tecumseh  but general harrison knew his business and carried on to the successful end | that end was not far distant | general tecumseh and general proctor together failed to take fort meigs | general proctor ordered a retreat | general harrison followed on the trail | general tecumseh hated to retreat | at every step he was abandoning indian country | the retreat northward to canada continued | tecumseh was fighting the battle of his people not of the english he wished to go no farther | he proposed to his warriors that they leave for another region and let the americans and british fight their own war |  they promised us plenty of soldiers to help us | instead we are treated like the dogs of snipe hunters we are always sent ahead to rouse the game |  you got us into this war by your promises retorted the sioux and the chippewas |  you have no right to break us | any appeal to tecumseh's honor was certain to win he stuck | then american ships under commodore oliver hazard perry fought british ships under commodore barclay on lake erie and gained a great victory | from an island near shore the tecumseh warriors peered eagerly to the sound of the heavy guns |  a few days since you were boasting that you commanded the waters had said tecumseh to general proctor |  why do you not go out and meet the americans | they are daring you to meet them you must send out your fleet and fight them | tecumseh was no fool | he had before caught the general in a lie | we are afraid that our father will do so again |listen  our ships have gone out we know they have fought we have heard the great guns but we know nothing of what happened | if they defeat us we will then retreat with our father | we are resolved to defend our lands and if it be his will we wish to leave our bones upon them | general proctor writhed under this speech but he had to swallow it | he might have done better by taking council with tecumseh and attacking the americans at the instant of their landing on the canadian shore | the indians would have fought very hard even yet for him | but he ordered the retreat again he burned fort maiden and marched inland up the thames river of southwestern ontario | tecumseh went unwillingly | his indians were down hearted | general harrison crossed from detroit and pursued | tecumseh felt the sting |  we are now going to follow the british he said to jim blue jacket son of old chief blue jacket and i believe we shall never return | he rode with general proctor in a buggy and suggested several places that looked good for making a stand | once general proctor agreed | it was indeed an excellent spot where a large creek joined the thames |  we will here defeat general harrison or leave our bones he declared | that was a talk right to tecumseh's liking |  when i look upon these two streams they remind me of the wabash and the tippecanoe of my own country he said hopefully | but after tecumseh had gladly arranged his warriors general proctor decided to leave them as a rear guard and to march on with his soldiers | the americans brought up ten cannon and tecumseh was wounded in the left arm and the indians had to retreat also | on the fourth of october which was a few days afterward at another good place tecumseh said that he would go no farther into canada | this was british soil not indian soil | unless the americans were whipped and the trail home was opened how were his indians ever to help the other indians fight | on the morning of the next day october 5 1813 he and general proctor made their battle plans |  shall we fight the americans father | asked sagaunash or billy caldwell | he was half english and half potawatomi and acted as tecumseh's secretary to translate shawnee into french or english | tecumseh was gloomy | he had no faith in the british general |  yes my son | before the sun sets we shall be in the enemy's smoke |go  you are wanted by proctor | i will never see you again | he posted his men | then he addressed his chiefs |  brother warriors | we are about to enter a fight from which i shall not come out | my body will remain | he handed his sword and belt to a friend |  when my son becomes a great warrior and able to use a sword give him this | then tecumseh stripped off his red uniform coat bearing the gold epaulets of a british brigadier general | he was to fight as an ordinary indian in buckskin hunting shirt | there were nine hundred british soldiers and one thousand indians | they were well stationed | the left flank british was protected by the deep thames river the right flank indian was protected by a soft swamp | the americans of general harrison came on | they numbered three thousand: one hundred and twenty united states regulars the rest kentucky volunteer infantry with one regiment of mounted riflemen under bold colonel richard m johnson of kentucky | tecumseh would have given a great deal to whip this doughty general harrison who had come out of his hole at last | there were old scores between them | but as between the logs had warned a ground hog is a very difficult animal | general william henry harrison of virginia knew how to fight when in his hole or fort and he knew how to fight when out of his hole and he knew indian fighting as well as white fighting | here were three brigadier generals harrison tecumseh and proctor | but the battle was soon over | general proctor had made the mistake of posting his soldiers in open order | general harrison's eye was quick to note the weakness | he let the indians alone for a few minutes and sent the right of the mounted backwoodsmen in a charge against the british | the horses broke clear through wheeled and the deed had been done | the british soldiers threw aside their guns to surrender general proctor dashed furiously away in his buggy | headed by colonel johnson himself the left companies of the mounted riflemen now charged upon tecumseh | the infantry followed | the indians had small chance but they fought well | tecumseh waited until they could see the flints in the american rifles | then he fired raised the shawnee war whoop they all fired and rushed with their tomahawks to the encounter | yes they fought well | their close volley had killed many americans | the horse leader who was colonel johnson had been wounded the horse soldiers were fighting on foot because the swamp had entangled the horses' legs | the american infantry barely stood fast under the first shock | tecumseh's voice had been heard constantly shouting for victory as before him old annawan the wampanoag and cornstalk the other shawnee had shouted | suddenly the voice had ceased | a cry arose instead: tecumseh is dead | tecumseh is dead | and at that as a potawatomi afterward explained we all ran | some people said that tecumseh had charged with the tomahawk upon the wounded colonel johnson and that colonel johnson had shot him with a pistol just in time | some people denied this | colonel johnson himself said that he did not know he did not pause to ask the indian's name and did not stay to examine him | there was quite an argument over the honor but tecumseh did not care | he was lying dead in his simple buckskin and for a time was not even recognized | a gaudily dressed chief was mistaken for him until friendly indians with general harrison stated that the great tecumseh had a ridge on his thigh from a broken bone | by this he was found after nightfall | he was brought to the camp fires where a circle of the kentuckians gathered about him to admire his fine figure and handsome face | he had been a worthy foeman | so tecumseh quit at last | he never could have lived to see the white men pushed across the ohio and all the red men occupying the west as one nation | that was not written of his star or any other star | but he left a good reputation | he had been of high mind and clean heart and he had fought in the open | the british adjutant general at montreal issued public orders lamenting his death and praising his bravery | the british throne sent his young son puck e sha shin wa a sword and settled a pension upon the family in memory of the father | the prophet received a pension too | he stayed in canada until 1826 when he moved down among the shawnees of ohio again | he long out lived his greater brother and died in the shawnee village in present kansas in 1837 | he posed as a prophet to the very last | as for general william henry harrison who had broken them both borne onward by his nickname old tippecanoe he became in 1841 ninth president of the united states and on his reputation of having killed tecumseh colonel johnson already had been a vice president | soon it was a poor tribe indeed that did not have a medicine man who spoke from the great spirit | when tecumseh first visited the creeks in georgia and alabama they were not ready for war | they were friendly to the whites and were growing rich in peace | the creeks belonged to the musk ho ge an family and numbered twenty thousand people in fifty towns | they had light complexions and were good looking | their women were short their men tall straight quick and proud | their english name creeks referred to the many streams in their country of georgia and eastern alabama | they were also called muskogee and muscogee by reason of their language the musk ho ge an | they were well civilized and lived almost in white fashion | they kept negro slaves the same as the white people to till their fields and wait upon them they wore clothing of calico cotton and the like in bright colors | their houses were firmly built of reed and cane with thatched roofs their towns were orderly | with the chickasaws and the choctaws their neighbors in western alabama and in mississippi they were at war and had more than held their own | white was their peace color and red their war color | and when tecumseh gave them the red sticks on which to count the days he did nothing new | the war parties of the creeks already were known as red sticks | this was their custom: that a portion of their towns should be white towns where peace ceremonies should be performed and no human blood should be shed the other portion should be red towns where war should be declared by erecting a red painted pole around which the warriors should gather | the war clans were bearers of the red or red sticks | the first visit by tecumseh in 1811 carrying his great spirit talk of a union of all indian nations failed to make the creeks erect their red poles | even the earthquake that tecumseh was supposed to have brought about by the stamping of his foot failed to do more than to frighten the creeks | but they caught the prophet fad | their pretended prophets began to stir them up and throw fear into them | in 1802 the united states had bought from the creeks a large tract of georgia the white people were determined to move into it | alarmed the creeks met in council after tecumseh's visit and voted to sell no more of their lands without the consent of every tribe in the nation | whoever privately signed to sell land should die | all land was to be held in common lest the white race over run the red | that was a doctrine of the shawnee prophet himself as taught to him by the great spirit | when tecumseh came down from canada in the winter of 1812 on his second visit the creeks were ripening for war | their red sticks party was very strong | the many prophets some of whom were half negro had declared that the whites could be driven into the sea | the soil of the creek nation was to be sacred soil | traders had been at work promising aid and supplying ammunition in order to enlist the creeks upon the british side | so in the red towns the red sticks struck the painted poles the peace party sat still in the white towns and was despised by the reds as white in blood as well as in spirit | the hope of the creeks was to wipe the white man's settlements from the face of mississippi georgia and tennessee | alabama in the middle would then be safe also | but the choctaws the chickasaws the cherokees refused to join | the white sticks themselves listened to the words of their old men and of head chief william macintosh they said that they had no feud with the united states | commencing with president washington the united states had treated the creeks honestly the creek nation had grown rich on its own lands | the red sticks went to war and a savage war they waged the more savage because by this time the spring of 1813 all the creeks were not of pure blood | they had lived so long in peace in their towns that their men and women had married not only among the white people but also among the black people therefore their blood was getting to be a mixture of good and bad from three races | head chief william macintosh was the peace chief | he was half scotch and half creek and bore his father's family name | he joined the side of the united states | the war chiefs were lam o chat tee or red eagle and menewa | they too were half breeds | chief red eagle was called william weatherford after his white trader father who had married a creek girl | he lived in princely style on a fine plantation surrounded with slaves and luxury | menewa was second to chief macintosh | his name meant great warrior and by reason of his daring he had earned another name ho thle po ya or crazy war hunter | he was born in 1765 and was now forty eight years old | he and chief macintosh were rivals for favor and position | menewa was the head war chief he frequently crossed into tennessee to steal horses from the american settlers there | a murder was committed by indians near his home georgians burned one of his towns as punishment | chief macintosh was accused of having caused this murder in order to enrage the white people against menewa and when macintosh stood out for peace menewa stood out for war | he and chief weatherford led the red sticks upon the war trail but greater in rank than either of them was monahoe the ruling prophet of menewa's own band | he was the head medicine chief | he was the sitting bull of the creeks like the later sitting bull of the sioux | out went the red sticks encouraged by monahoe and the other prophets | already the white settlers had become alarmed at the quarrel between the macintosh bands and the menewa bands | when two indian parties fight then the people near them suffer by raids | all alabama mississippi and georgia prepared for defense | there were killings but the first big blow with the creek hatchet to help the british and to drive the americans into the sea was struck in august against fort mimms at the mouth of the alabama river in southwestern alabama above mobile | with all the cunning of the three bloods the warriors waited until sand enough had drifted day by day to keep the gate of the fort from being quickly closed | then at noon of august 30 they rushed in | the commander of the fort had been warned but he was as foolish as some of those officers in the pontiac war | the garrison of regulars militia and volunteers fought furiously in vain | more than three hundred and fifty soldiers and the families of settlers both were killed only thirty persons escaped | now it was the days of king philip over again and this time in tennessee georgia alabama and mississippi instead of in massachusetts rhode island and connecticut | at the news of fort mimms the settlers fled for protection into towns and block houses | if the choctaws the chickasaws and other southern indians joined in league with the creeks there easily would be fifteen thousand brave fierce warriors in the field | however the choctaws and chickasaws enlisted with the united states chief macintosh's friendly creeks did not falter and speedily the fiery andy jackson was marching down from tennessee at the head of two thousand picked men to crush out the men of menewa and weatherford | other columns from tennessee georgia alabama and mississippi also were on the trail | the creeks fought to the death but they made their stands in vain | the united states was on a war footing it had the soldiers and the guns and the leaders its columns of militia destroyed town after town even the sacred creek capital where warriors from eight towns together gathered to resist the invader | yes and even the town built by direction of the prophets and named holy ground and protected by magic | by the close of 1813 this jackson chula harjo old mad jackson as the creeks dubbed him had proved to be as tough as his later name old hickory | but menewa and weatherford were tough too | they and their more than one thousand warriors still hung out | in march they were led by their prophets to another and holier ground tohopeka or horseshoe bend on the tallapoosa river in eastern alabama | the creek town of oakfuskee was located below | and here in 1735 some eighty years before there had been a fort of their english friends | it was good ground | chief prophet monahoe and two other prophets by song and dance enchanted the ground inside the bend and made it safe from the foot of any white man | monahoe said that he had a message from heaven that assured victory to the creeks in this spot | if the old mad jackson came he and all his soldiers should die by wrath from a cloud | hail as large as hominy mortars would flatten them out | as was well known to the creeks old mad jackson was having his troubles | the great spirit had sent troubles upon him had caused his men to rebel and his provisions to fail until acorns were saved and eaten | the united states could not much longer fight the british and the indians together | let the creeks not give up | the horseshoe was rightly named for a sharp curve of the tallapoosa river enclosed about one hundred acres of brushy timbered bluffs and low land very thick to the foot | the entrance to the neck was only three hundred yards wide | on the three other sides the river flowed deep | menewa was the field commander of the red sticks at this place | he showed a great head he was half white and half red but all creek in education | across the neck at its narrowest point he had a barricade of logs erected from river bank to river bank | the barricade of three to five logs piled eight feet high and filled with earth and rock was pierced with a double row of port holes: one row for the kneeling warriors and one for the standing warriors | the barricade was built in zigzags along a concave curve so that attackers would be cut down by shots from two sides as well as from in front | by reason of the zig zags it could not be raked from either end | all around the high ground back of the barricade trees were laid and brush arranged so that the warriors might if driven pass back from covert to covert until they reached the huts of the women and children and old men at the river behind | here a hundred canoes were drawn up on the bank in readiness | but the red sticks of chief menewa had no thought of flight | they were one thousand | their prophets had assured them over and over that the medicine of the creek nation was strong at last that the great spirit was fighting for them that the bullets of the americans would have no effect and that the americans themselves would die before the barricade was reached | the cloud would come and help the creeks with hail hail like hominy mortars | on march 24 old mad jackson just appointed by president madison to be major general in the united states army set out against crazy war hunter menewa at tohopeka | the way was difficult through dense timber swamps and cane brakes | alabama in these days had been only thinly settled by white people | he had three thousand men: a part of the 39th u s infantry a thousand tennessee militia six hundred friendly creeks and cherokees | he had two cannon: a six pounder and a three pounder | his chief assistant was general john coffee of alabama who had formerly been his business partner | major lemuel p montgomery a virginian of tennessee commanded one battalion of the regulars | he was six feet two inches aged twenty eight and the finest looking man in the army | young sam houston who became the hero of texas independence was a third lieutenant | head chief william macintosh menewa's rival led the creeks | chief richard brown led the cherokees | in the evening of march 26 bold general jackson viewed the red sticks' fort and found it very strong | he was amazed by the skill with which it had been laid out | no trained military engineers could have done better | but his indian spies saw everything they saw the line of canoes drawn up in the brush along the river bank behind at the base of the bend and general jackson decided to do what the red sticks had not expected him to do | early in the next morning march 27 he detached general coffee with seven hundred mounted men the five hundred cherokees and the one hundred creeks to make a circuit cross the river below the bend and come up on the opposite side behind the horseshoe | this would cut off escape in canoes | with the remainder of his soldiers he advanced to the direct attack upon the breast works | he planted his two cannon | at ten o'clock he opened hot fire with the camion and with muskets | chief menewa's red sticks were ready and defiant | they answered with whoops and bullets | their three prophets horridly adorned with bird crests and feathers and jingling charms danced and sang to bring the cloud | the balls from the cannon only sank into the damp pine logs and did no damage | the musket balls stopped short or hissed uselessly over | for two hours old mad jackson attacked from a distance | he had not dared to charge the prophets danced faster they chanted higher the red sticks had been little harmed they whooped gaily they had faith in their holy ground | but suddenly there arose behind them a fresh hubbub of shots and shouts and the screams of their women and children the smoke of their burning huts welled above the tree tops | general coffee with his mounted men had completely surrounded the bend on the opposite side of the river his indians had swum across had seized the canoes had ferried their comrades over by the hundred the soldiers were following and now the menewa warriors were between two fires | at the instant here came mad jackson's troops to charge the barricade | that was a terrible fight at the breast works | chief menewa encouraged his men | the test of the holy ground protected by the great spirit and the prophets had arrived | the battle was to decide whether the creek nation or the american nation was to rule in georgia and alabama and the red sticks made mighty defense | while they raged they looked for the cloud in the sky | she's a new breed | i was as good a mother as 'twas in my skin to be and i'd like to see a child of mine do it for me and as for my grandchildren it hustles some of them to re cog nize me passing on the big road 'specially if it's peter's girl with a town beau | the harvester laughed | the old lady leaned toward him with a mist in her eyes and a quaver in her voice and asked softly got ary friend that could help you david | the man looked straight ahead in silence |  bamfoozle all the rest of them as much as you please lad but i stand to you in the place of your ma and so i ast you plainly got ary friend that could help |  i can think of no way in which any one possibly could help me dear said the harvester gently |  it is a matter i can't explain but i know of nothing that any one could do |  you mean you're tight mouthed | you could tell me just like you would your ma if she was up and comin' but you can't quite put me in her place and spit it out plain | now mebby i can help you | is it her fault or yourn | mine  mine entirely | hum  what a fool question | i might a knowed it | i never saw a lovinger sweeter girl in these parts | i jest worship the ground she treads on and you lad you hain't had a heart in your body sence first you saw her face | if i had the stren'th i'd haul you out of this keeridge and i'd hammer you meller david langston | what in the name of sense have you gone and done to the purty lovin' child | the harvester's face flushed but a line around his mouth whitened |  loosen up | commanded granny |  i got some rights in this case that mebby you don't remember | you asked me to help you get ready for her and i done what you wanted | you invited me to visit her and i jest loved her sweet purty ways | you wanted me to shet up my house and come over for weeks to help take keer of her and i done it gladly for her pain and your sufferin' cut me as if 'twas my livin' flesh and blood so you can't shet me out now | i'm in with you and her to the end | what a blame fool thing have you gone and done to drive away for months a girl that fair worshipped you |  that's exactly the trouble granny said the harvester |  she didn't | she merely respected and was grateful to me and she loved me as a friend but i never was any nearer her husband than i am yours |  i've always knowed they was a screw loose somewhere commented granny |  and so you've sent her off to her worldly folks in a big wicked city to get weaned away from you complete |  i sent her to let her see if absence would teach her anything | i had months with her here and i lay awake at nights thinking up new plans to win her | i worked for her love as i never worked for bread but i couldn't make it | so he tore loose a hollow joint of cane and crouching under the water with the end of the cane stuck above the surface he held fast to a root and breathed through the cane | here he stayed under water for four hours until darkness had cloaked land and river and the yelling and shooting had ceased | then soaked and chilled and stiffened he cautiously straightened up | he waded through the cane brake hobbled all night through the forest and got away | but he had no army | of his one thousand red sticks eight hundred were dead | five hundred and fifty seven bodies were found upon the horseshoe battle field | one hundred and fifty more had perished in the river | only one warrior was unwounded | three hundred women and children had been captured and but three men | the red sticks of the creek nation were wiped out | of the whites twenty six had been killed one hundred and seven wounded | of the cherokee and creek scouts twenty three had been killed forty seven wounded | chief william macintosh also had fought bravely but he had not been harmed | the red sticks now agreed to a treaty of peace with the united states and chief menewa scarred from head to foot was the hero of his band |  one of the bravest chiefs that ever lived is written after his name by white historians | in due time he again opposed chief macintosh and won out | for in 1825 macintosh was bribed by the white people to urge upon his nation the selling of the last of their lands in georgia | he signed the papers so did a few other chiefs but the majority thirty six in number refused | only some three hundred of the creeks were parties to the signing away of the land of the whole nation | the three thousand other chiefs and warriors said that by creek law which chief macintosh himself had proposed the land could not be sold except through the consent of a grand council | as the nation owned the land and had built better towns and was living well and peacefully the council decided that chief macintosh must be put to death for he was a traitor and he knew the law | chief menewa was asked to consent he ruled by reason of his wisdom and his scars | finally he saw no other way than to order the deed done for the creek law was plain | on the morning of may 1 he took a party of warriors to the chief macintosh house and surrounded it | there were some white georgians inside | he directed them to leave as he had come to kill only chief macintosh according to the law | so the white men and the women and children left | when chief macintosh bolted in flight he was shot dead | the georgia people who desired the creek land prepared for war or to arrest menewa and his party | but the president learning the ins and outs of the trouble and seeing that the land had not been sold by the creek nation ordered the sale held up | the creeks stayed where they were for some years | menewa went to war once more in 1836 and helped the united states fight against the seminoles of florida | in return for this he asked permission to remain and live in his own country of the creeks | but he was removed with the last of the nation beyond the mississippi to the indian territory | there an old man he died | they were of the algonquian tongue | from the northern great lakes country they had moved over to the mississippi river and down to illinois and iowa | their number was not more than six thousand | they were a shave head indian of forest and stream and accustomed to travel afoot or in canoes | the foxes built their bark house villages on the west side of the mississippi in iowa's great nose | they called themselves mus qua kees or the red earth people | they said that they had been made from red clay | their totem was a fox and the french of the great lakes had dubbed them foxes had asserted that like the fox they were quarrelsome tricky and thievish | as warriors they were much feared | they had lost heavily | the sacs built opposite on the illinois shore from rock river down | they called themselves saukees from their word o sa ki wug or yellow earth people | they were larger and better looking than the foxes and not so tricky but their bravery was never doubted | these two nations together drove out the other indians in this new country | they whipped even the sioux who claimed the northern iowa hunting grounds they whipped the omahas osages and pawnees of the west the mascoutins to the south and the illinois tribes | they were here to stay | while the men hunted and fished and went to war the women raised great crops of beans squashes melons potatoes and indian corn and gathered the wild rice of the lakes | among the sac leaders was ma ka tai me she kia kiak big black breast or black hawk | like little turtle of the miamis he had not been born a chief but he was of the thunder clan the head clan of the sacs | his father was py e sa a warrior of the rank of braves and keeper of the tribal medicine bag | his grandfather was na na ma kee or thunder also a brave | black hawk was born in 1767 in sauk e nuk the principal sac village where rock island illinois now stands north of the mouth of the rock river | he won the rank of brave when he was only fifteen years old | he did this by killing and scalping an osage warrior on the war trail against these head takers | after that he was allowed in the scalp dances | he went against the osages a second time | with seven men he attacked one hundred and escaped carrying another scalp | when he was eighteen he and five comrades pierced the osage country across the missouri river and got more scalps | when he was nineteen he led two hundred other braves against the osages and killed five osages with his own hand | by his deeds he had become a chief | in a battle with the cherokees below st louis his father pyesa fell | young black hawk was awarded the medicine bag the soul of the sac nation | in the early spring of 1804 a man of the sac band then living on the missouri near st louis to hunt and trade killed a white man | he was arrested | the sacs and poxes held a council and chose four chiefs to go to st louis and buy their warrior's freedom with presents | this was the indian way | the chiefs selected were pa she pa ho or stabber who was head chief of the sacs quash qua me or jumping fish ou che qua ha or sun fish and ha she quar hi qua or bear | they went in the summer of 1804 and were gone a long time | when they returned they were wearing new medals and seemed ashamed | they camped outside of saukenuk for several days before they reported in council | the man they had been sent to get was not with them | finally in the council they said that they had signed away a great tract of land mostly on the west side of the mississippi above st louis in order to buy the warrior's life they had been drunk when they signed but that was all right | however when they had signed the warrior was let out and as he started to come to them the soldiers had shot him dead | they still were not certain just what land they had signed away | that made the council and people angry | black hawk called the chiefs fools | they had no right to sell the land without the consent of the council | after this the missouri band of the sacs kept by themselves in disgrace | it was too late to do anything more about the treaty | the united states had it | an indian gets only one chance and head chief pashepaho himself had put his mark on the paper | the united states has two chances: the first on the ground the second when the paper is sent to washington | later it was found that pashepaho and the others had signed away all the sac and fox lands east of the mississippi river | that was how the treaty might be made to read | the payment for many millions of acres was 2 234 54 down in goods and 1 000 a year in other goods | but there was one pleasing clause | as long as the united states held the land the sacs and foxes might live and hunt there | any white men who tried to come in were to be arrested and put off | at any rate although black hawk raged and said that the treaty was a false treaty it stood | the united states officials who had signed it were men of honest names and considered that they had acted fairly | but black hawk never admitted that | the united states was to erect a trading post up the mississippi for the convenience of the sacs and foxes | in 1808 soldiers appeared above the mouth of the des moines river on the west side of the mississippi in southeastern iowa and began to build | this turned out to be not a trading post but a fort named fort belle vue and afterward fort madison | the sacs and foxes and their allies the potawatomis and winnebagos planned to destroy it and made attacks | black hawk was sore at the americans | he listened to the words of tecumseh and the prophet accepted the presents of the british agents who came to see him and with two hundred warriors marched to help the british in the war of 1812 | the british traders had been more generous with the indians than the american traders | now the british father at the lakes saluted him as general black hawk | only black hawk's band went | all the other sacs and foxes paid attention to the talk of keokuk the watchful fox who was the sac peace chief | like the great cornstalk he said to the people that if they were bound to go to war they should first put all the women and children into the long sleep for we enter upon a trail that has no turn | he was called a coward by the black hawk band but the other sacs and foxes stayed where they were |  general black hawk fought beside general tecumseh | he asserted that he was in the big battle when tecumseh was killed | when he found that the indians had nothing to gain in the war he came home | he had done wrong to go at all | then he learned that a young man whom he had adopted as a son had been murdered while hunting by bad whites | they had seized him tied him killed him and scalped him | the young man had not been to war and black hawk could see no reason for the killing | so he set forth in revenge and fought a battle with the united states rangers | he remained unfriendly | it all dated back to the year 1804 and the treaty signed by pashepaho by which the sacs had lost their country | they loved this country | they especially loved rock island in the mississippi where today is located a government arsenal | it was indeed a beautiful island for them | it bore grapes and nuts and they called it their garden | in a cave there a kind spirit dwelt who blessed the land of the indians | the spirit had white wings like a swan | but in 1816 the united states built fort armstrong right on top of the cave and the good spirit flew away never to come back | the guns of the fort frightened it | black hawk himself had another favorite spot upon a bluff overlooking the mississippi river and his village of saukenuk | here he liked to sit | it is still known as black hawk's watch tower | after fort armstrong was built and the united states was again at peace with the other white nations settlers commenced to edge into this sac country of western illinois | although by another treaty which black hawk himself had signed the treaty of 1804 was re pledged by the sacs and foxes this all was united states land and no settlers had any rights to it | the indians were unable to put the settlers off and trouble arose | once black hawk was taken in the forest by settlers who accused him of shooting their hogs they tore his gun from him and beat him with sticks | this was such a disgrace to him that he painted a black mark on his face and wore the mark for almost ten years | only a scalp could wipe it off | the white trespassers kept coming in | they respected nothing | they even built fences around the corn fields of the principal sac village at the mouth of rock river they ploughed up the grave yard there they took possession of black hawk's own lodge and when in the spring of 1828 the black hawk people came back from their winter hunt they found that forty of their lodges had been burned | up to this time none of the land had been put on the market by the united states | but the indian agent was trying to persuade the sacs to move across the mississippi into iowa | that was for their own good | the white settlers were using whiskey and every other means to get the upper hand | chief keokuk agreed with the agent | he was not of the rank of black hawk and the thunder clan but he had fought the sioux and was of great courage and keen mind and silver tongue | he was an orator black hawk was a warrior | so the sacs split | keokuk a stout heavy faced man took his sacs across into the country of the foxes | black hawk's band said they would be shamed if they gave up their village and the graves of their fathers | black hawk visited some white chiefs judges who were on rock island | he made complaint | he said that he wore a black mark on his face but that if he tried to avenge the black mark by striking a white man then the white men would call it war | he said that the sacs dared not resent having their lodges burned and their corn fields fenced and their women beaten and the graves of their fathers ploughed up |  why do you not tell the president |  he is too far off | he cannot hear my voice |  why do you not write a letter to him |  it would be written by white men who would say that we told lies | our great father would rather believe a white man than an indian | the two judges said that they were sorry for the sacs but could do nothing | now in 1829 the settlers were so anxious to keep the sac lands at the mouth of the rock river that the government put these on the market | this would dispose of black hawk's people for they would have no village | whether the other lands were sold did not matter | it was done while black hawk and his men and women were hunting | on their return to plant their crops they learned that their village and grave yard had been sold to the whites the most of whom were already there | so the white people had won out | they in turn asked protection of the government from general black hawk and his band | the government listened and ten companies of regular troops were sent to rock island in a steamboat to remove the sacs dead or alive to the west side of the mississippi | a council was held with black hawk at fort armstrong on rock island | black hawk rose to speak | he said that the sacs never had sold their lands it had been a mistake and that they were bound to keep their village |  who is this black hawk | retorted general edmund p gaines the commander of the troops |  is he a chief | by what right does he appear in council | black hawk wrapped his blanket around him and strode angrily out of the council room | but the next morning he made answer | more troops were called until there were twenty five hundred | but seeing so many soldiers marching black hawk took all his people and camped across the mississippi under a white flag | after this black hawk was required to sign another treaty which made him say that he had tried to enlist the potawatomis winnebagos and kickapoos in a war against the united states | it did not mention the fact that for a dozen and more years the whites had been warring upon him by seizing his lands and ploughing his fields and burning his lodges | the paper also set him down below the other chiefs who had left their lands | it set him below keokuk and the fox chiefs and this hurt him deeply | all the sacs and foxes laughed at the idea of keokuk and his lowly clan being placed above black hawk and the thunder clan | in these years of trouble the black hawk band had killed or abused no white settlers | the so called war on their part had been a war of words and fences | now they soon were to take up the hatchet | they had been expelled over the river in this year 1831 too late for planting crops | the white settlers declined to share with them from the fields at the village of saukenuk | one night some of the sacs crossed to steal roasting ears from their own fields as they said | they were shot at by the settlers and driven off | this made more bad feeling | black hawk had sent his head warrior nah po pe or soup up to canada to ask council from the british father there | he had been general black hawk in the british army and thought that he deserved help | but the united states and great britain had been at peace many years | the british father told nahpope that if the sacs never had sold their land of course they had a right to live upon it | that was all | on the way back nahpope stopped to see wa bo kie shiek or white cloud who was half sac and half winnebago and a great medicine man or prophet | he had a village at his prophet's town thirty five miles up the rock river in illinois | white cloud pretended to rival the open door of the shawnees | he fell into a trance and cut several capers and spoke a message from the great spirit | let black hawk go to war | the great spirit would arouse the winnebagos and the potawatomis and the british and the americans would be driven away | white cloud said this out of his own heart which was black toward the americans | he invited black hawk to visit him and the winnebagos and the potawatomis raise a summer crop and talk with the great spirit | much rejoiced nahpope hastened to tell the news to his chief | when keokuk heard it he advised black hawk to stay at home | the prophet white cloud was a mischief maker and a liar | black hawk was inclined to listen and to wait until he was more certain of the other nations who might join with him | but the young men of his band were hot | unless he did something keokuk would appear to be stronger than he | his people looked to him to get back their village and their grave yard | the black mark on his face had not been wiped off | none of keokuk's sacs or the foxes would help him | so in april of 1832 he took his men and their families and started up the river from fort madison iowa for rock river | the warriors were on horses the women and children in canoes | by the last treaty that he had signed black hawk had promised not to cross to the east side of the mississippi without the permission of the united states | now he said that he was going up the rock river to the country of the winnebagos his friends to visit among them and plant corn and beans | on the way up the rock river he was ordered back by word from general henry atkinson commander at fort armstrong | black hawk replied that he had a right to travel peacefully the same as white persons | he was going to the winnebago country for the summer | the general sent another word that if black hawk did not turn around soldiers would make him turn around | black hawk replied that he was at peace and would stay at peace unless the soldiers attacked him | he told his men not to fire first | pretty soon he met some winnebagos and potawatomis | they said that their nations never had sent him any message talking war | they wished no trouble with the united states | wabokieshiek had lied | so black hawk decided to give his guests a dog feast and then return home | he was an old man of sixty five and he was too weak to fight alone | he was getting tired | he had made camp one hundred miles up the rock river near kishwaukee a few miles below present rockford illinois | by this time early in may all illinois was alarmed the regulars and militia were on his trail | they gathered at dixon about forty miles down the river from his camp | major isaac stillman took two hundred and seventy five mounted militia to scout for black hawk | they arrived at sycamore creek within eight miles of him and did not see his camp | but black hawk knew that they were there | he sent out three young men with a white flag to bring the american chiefs to the camp for a council then they would all go down river together | he sent out five young men to follow the three and see what happened | only three of the five came back | the three with the white flag had been taken prisoners and the soldiers had chased the others and shot two | black hawk prepared for war | he had but forty men with him the rest were out hunting | presently here came all the white soldiers galloping and yelling to ride over him | they were foolish they seemed to think that the sacs would run | but black hawk was old in war | he laid an ambush his forty warriors waited and fired a volley and charged with the tomahawk and knife and away scurried the soldiers like frightened deer | they fled without stopping forty miles to dixon's ferry | they reported that they had been attacked by fifteen hundred savages | they left all their camp stuff | fourteen soldiers had been killed but no indians except those sent by black hawk to treat for peace |  stillman's run the battle was called | black hawk sat down to smoke a pipe to the great spirit and give thanks | two of the flag of truce party came in | they had escaped | the third young man had been shot while in the soldiers' camp | the black hawk band took the blankets and provisions left in the soldiers' camp and proceeded to war in earnest | of what use was a white flag | they sent away their families | some winnebagos hearing of the great victory enlisted | now black hawk was much feared | general atkinson fortified his regulars and militia at dixon's ferry | more volunteers were called for by the governor of illinois | the secretary of war at washington ordered one thousand additional regulars to the scene and directed general winfield scott himself the commander of the united states army in the east to lead the campaign | for a little war against a few indians there were many famous names on the white man's roll | among the regulars were general scott later the commander in the war with mexico colonel zachary taylor who had defended fort harrison from tecumseh and probably black hawk in the war of 1812 and who was to be president lieutenant jefferson davis who became president of the confederate states lieutenant albert sydney johnston who became a confederate general lieutenant robert anderson who commanded fort sumter in 1861 and among the volunteers was captain abraham lincoln | black hawk had about five hundred braves mainly sacs and foxes with a few winnebagos and potawatomis but when twenty five hundred soldiers were chasing him through the settlements he stood little show | after several skirmishes and one or two bad defeats his people were eating horse flesh and bark and roots | to save them he planned to go down the wisconsin river in southwestern wisconsin and cross the mississippi | he put his women and children and the old men on rafts and in canoes | they started but soldiers fired into them from the banks killed some and drove the rest into the forest | many died there from hunger | black hawk and his warriors and other women and children had cut across by land | when they came to the mouth of the bad axe river at the mississippi above the wisconsin the armed steamboat warrior met them | sioux were upon the western bank | black hawk decided to surrender | he again raised the white flag and called out to the captain of the warrior that he wished a boat sent to him so that he might go aboard and talk peace | perhaps the winnebago interpreter on the warrior did not translate the words right | at any rate the captain of the warrior asserted that black hawk was only trying to decoy him into ambush | he waited fifteen minutes to give the indian women and children that much time to hide then he opened on the white flag with canister and musketry | the first cannon shot laid out three | in all he killed twenty three | black hawk fought back but he could not do very much against a steamboat in the river | so he had been unable to surrender or to cross the mississippi | his people were frightened and sick with hunger and wounds | the next morning august 2 he was working hard to get them ready to cross when general atkinson's main army of four hundred regulars and nine hundred militia fell upon him at the mouth of the bad axe | the indian women plunged into the mississippi with their babes on their backs some of them caught hold of horses' tails to be towed faster but the steamboat warrior was waiting sharp shooters on shore espied them and only a few escaped into the hands of the sioux | in two hours black hawk lost two hundred people men and women both the white army lost twenty seven in killed and wounded | this finished black hawk | he got away but spies were on his trail and in a few weeks two winnebago traitors captured him when he gave himself up at fort crawford prairie du chien wisconsin | he expected to die | he had turned his medicine bag over to the winnebago chief at the village of la crosse wisconsin and he never got it back | he made a speech to the indian agent general joseph street at prairie du chien | he said: you have taken me prisoner with all my warriors | i am much grieved for i expected to hold out much longer and give you more trouble before i surrendered | i tried hard to bring you into ambush but your last general understands indian fighting | i fought hard but your guns were well aimed | the bullets flew like bees in the air and whizzed by our ears like wind through the trees in winter | my warriors fell around me i saw my evil day at hand | the sun rose dim on us in the morning and at night it sank in a dark cloud and looked like a ball of fire | that was the last sun that shone on black hawk | his heart is dead | he is now a prisoner to the white men they will do with him as they wish | but he can stand torture and is not afraid of death | he is no coward | black hawk is an indian | he has done nothing for which an indian ought to be ashamed | he has fought for his people against the white men who have come year after year to cheat him and take away his lands | you know the cause of our making war | it is known to all white men | they ought to be ashamed of it | the white men despise the indians and drive them from their homes | an indian who is as bad as the white men could not live in our nation he would be put to death and be eaten up by the wolves | the white men are poor teachers they shake us by the hand to make us drunk and fool us | we told them to let us alone but they followed us | things were growing worse | there were no deer in the forests the springs were drying up and our women and children had no food | the spirits of our fathers arose and spoke to us to avenge our wrongs or die | black hawk is satisfied | he will go to the land of spirits content | he has done his duty | his father will meet him there and praise him | he is a true indian and disdains to cry like a woman | he does not care for himself | he cares for his nation | they will suffer | his country men will not be scalped the white men poison the heart | in a few years the indians will be like the white men and nobody can trust them | they will need many officers to keep them in order | goodby my nation | black hawk tried to save you | he drank the blood of some of the whites | he has been stopped | he can do no more | after this black hawk had little authority among the sacs and foxes | they respected him but they looked only to keokuk for orders and advice | keokuk was made rich by the united states as reward he gave out the goods and monies he ruled for he had followed the peace trail | the black hawk prisoners were put in charge of lieutenant jefferson davis at fort crawford | then they were sent down by steamboat to jefferson barracks at st louis | there were black hawk his two sons nah se us kuk or whirling thunder and wa saw me saw or roaring thunder white cloud the false prophet nahpope the head brave ioway pam a ho or swimmer no kuk qua or bear's fat pa she pa ho or little stabber and others | they were forced to wear ball and chain |  had i taken the white beaver who was general atkinson prisoner i would not have treated a brave war chief in this manner complained black hawk | keokuk the successful was kind and tried to get the prisoners freed | but they were sent on to washington to see the president | president andrew jackson understood indians and black hawk was pleased with him |  i am a man you are another he greeted as he grasped president jackson's hand |  we did not expect to conquer the whites he explained |  they had too many houses too many men | i took up the hatchet to avenge the injuries to my people | had i not done so they would have said 'black hawk is a woman | he is too old to be a chief | he is no sac ' | from the last of april until june 4 the black hawk party was kept in fortress monroe virginia | then the indians were started home | they were given a long tour to show them the power of the united states | they stopped at baltimore philadelphia new york albany buffalo and detroit | the white people crowded to see the famous black hawk and to hear him speak | he received valuable presents | he was treated like a chief indeed and his heart was touched | when he arrived at fort armstrong again on rock island where he was to be freed his heart had somewhat failed | the village of saukenuk had long ago been leveled in ashes he returned a chief without a people | keokuk came to attend this council and to receive him back into the nation | keokuk arrived riding grandly in two canoes lashed side by side a canopy over him and his wives with him and medals on his breast | that was rather different from ball and chain and old black hawk's head sank upon his chest | he felt as bitter as logan the mingo had felt | before he finally settled down in a lodge built near iowaville on the lower des moines river iowa he made other trips through the east | keokuk went also but it was general black hawk for whom the people clamored | he died on october 3 1838 at his home | his last speech was made at a fourth of july banquet at fort madison iowa where he was a guest of honor |  rock river was a beautiful country | i liked my towns my corn fields and the home of my people | i fought for it | it is now yours keep it as we did | it will bear you good crops |  i once was a great warrior | i am now poor | keokuk put me down but do not blame him | i am old | i have looked upon the mississippi since i was a child | i love the great river | i look upon it now | i shake hands with you and i hope you are my friends | these were some of his words | he was seventy one when he died a spare wrinkled old man with sharp fiery face and flashing eye | he picked out his grave at a place about half a mile from his cabin where he said he had led his sacs in a great battle with the iowas | all his people and the neighboring whites mourned him | he was buried sitting up clad in the uniform given him at washington by the secretary of war | between his knees was placed a cane presented to him by henry clay the statesman at his right side was placed a sword presented to him by president jackson | all his best things were buried with him | they included tobacco food and moccasins to last him on a three days' journey to spirit land | the grave was covered by a board roof | a united states flag and a post with his name and age and deeds were erected over him | a picket fence twelve feet high was built around the grave | he left an old wife the only wife that he had ever taken | he thought a great deal of her | he rarely drank whiskey he fought it among his people he was opposed to torture he had treated prisoners kindly he had waged war in defense as he believed of his own country and altogether he had been a good man in his indian way | his bones were dug up by a white doctor and strung on a wire to decorate an office in illinois | black hawk's sons did not like this and had the bones brought back | they were stored in the historical collection at burlington where in 1855 a fire burned them | black hawk probably did not care what became of his old bones | he was done with them | the white race had over flowed the land that he loved and the bones of his fathers and he had ceased fighting | when in march 1804 the united states took over that french province of louisiana which extended from the upper mississippi river west to the rocky mountains a multitude of indians changed white fathers | these western indians were much different from the eastern indians | they were long hair indians and horse indians accustomed to the rough buffalo chase and a wide range over vast treeless spaces | to learn about them and their country in may 1804 there started up the missouri river by boats from st louis the famed government exploring party commanded by captain meriwether lewis and captain william clark | it was an army expedition: twenty three enlisted men a hunter a squad of boatmen captain clark's black servant york and a squad of other soldiers for an escort part of the way | in all forty three under the two captains | their orders were to ascend the missouri river to its head and if possible to cross the mountains and travel westward still to the columbia river and its mouth at the pacific ocean of the oregon country | no white man knew what lay before them for no white man ever had made the trip | the trail was a trail in the dark | this fall they had gone safely as far as the hewn timber towns of the mandan indians in central north dakota here they wintered and met the little bird woman | her indian name was sa ca ga we a from two minnetaree words meaning bird and woman | but she was not a minnetaree who were a division of the sioux nation living in north dakota near the mandans | she was a sho sho ni or snake woman from the distant rocky mountains and had been captured by the minnetarees | between the minnetarees of the plains and the snakes of the mountains there was always war | now at only sixteen years of age she was the wife of toussaint chaboneau a leather faced leather clad french canadian trader living with the mandans | he had bought her from the minnetarees and how much he paid in trade is not stated but she was the daughter of a chief and rated a good squaw | toussaint had another wife he needed a younger one | therefore he bought sacagawea to mend his moccasins and greet him with a smile for his heart and warm water for his tired feet | his old wife had grown rather cross and grunty | chaboneau was engaged as interpreter this winter and moved over to the white camp | sacagawea proved to be such a cheerful willing little woman that the captains and the men made much of her | and when in february a tiny boy arrived to her and toussaint there was much delight | a baby in the camp helped to break the long dull spell of forty below zero weather when two suns shone feebly through the ice crystaled air | a thousand miles it was yet to the rocky or shining mountains by the river trail | in the mandan towns and in the american camp sacagawea was the only person who ever had been as far as those mountains | they were the home of her people but nearly three years had passed since she had been taken captive by the minnetarees | could she still speak the snake tongue |certainly  did she remember the trail to the country of the snakes |yes  was there a way across the mountains |yes  beyond some great falls in the missouri there was a gate by which the shoshonis came out of the mountains to hunt the buffalo on the plains | it was there that she had been captured by the minnetarees | would the snakes be friendly to the white men | yes unless they were frightened by the white men | would she like to go back to her own people |yes yes  that was great luck for sacagawea but it was greater luck for the two captains | in the spring they broke camp and taking chaboneau as interpreter in case that the hostile minnetarees were met and little sacagawea to spy out the land of the snakes and littlest toussaint the baby as a peace sign to all tribes with a picked party of thirty one the two captains started on up the swollen missouri | they made no mistake in the bird woman | of course she was used to roughing it that was the life of an indian woman to do the hard work for the men in camp and on the trail | but sacagawea early showed great good sense | her husband chaboneau almost capsized their canoe by his clumsiness | she neither shrieked nor jumped but calmly reaching out from it with her baby tightly held she gathered in the floating articles | she saved stuff of much value and the captains praised her |  she's a better man than her husband asserted the admiring soldiers | after hard travel fighting the swift current the strong winds storms of rain and sleet and monster grizzly bears the expedition arrived at the great falls as the bird woman had promised | she had ridden and waded and trudged like the rest | she had carried her baby on her back and had built the fires for her husband and cooked his meals and kept right along with the men and had not complained nor lagged | at the great falls she was not so certain of the best route | this was a strange country to her although she had known that the falls were here | the shining mountains were in sight the land of the shoshonis lay yonder to the southwest | all right | the captains chose what seemed to be the best route by water and headed on to the southwest | sacagawea gazed anxiously right left and before | her heart was troubled | she not only much desired to find her people for herself but she desired to help the great captains |  the fate of the whole party depended upon her and she was just a slight little indian woman | the snakes did not come down by this way | it was too far north it was the haunts of their enemies the blackfeet and the minnetarees of whom they were deathly afraid | they were a timid mountain folk poorly armed to fight the sioux who had obtained guns from traders down the missouri | after a time the river narrowed still more and between rough banks poured out from a canyon of high cliffs black at their base and creamy yellow above |  the gate of the mountains ain't it | passed the hopeful word | sacagawea agreed | she had heard of this very gate where the river burst into the first plains |  when we come to the place where the river splits into three parts that is shoshoni country my people will be there | on forged the boats poled and hauled and rowed while the men's soggy moccasins rotted into pieces and the mosquitoes bit fiercely | the two captains explored by land | hunting was forbidden lest the reports of the guns alarm the snakes | abandoned indian camp sites were found but the big horn sheep peered curiously down from the tops of the cliffs along the river and that was not a good sign | the game was too tame | captain clark the red head took the advance by land to look for the indians | captain lewis the young long knife chief commanded the boats | small united states flags were erected in the bows of each as a peace signal | the boats reached an open place where the river did indeed split into several branches |  the three forks nodded sacagawea brightly |  these are the three forks | we are on the right trail to the land of my people | now i know | the party proceeded at top speed | the southwest fork seemed to be the best for boating | the stream shallowed | at the next camp sacagawea was more excited |  she say here in dis spot is where de snake camp was surprise' by de minnetaree five years ago an' chase' into de timber announced drouillard the hunter |  de minnetaree keel four warrior an' capture four boy an' all de women | she was capture' here herself |hurrah  the trail was getting warm | the canoes had to be hauled by tow lines with sacagawea proudly riding in one of them and helping to fend off with a pole | she had not been here since she was a girl of eleven or twelve but she caught more landmarks |  dat is w'at ze snake call ze beaver's head proclaimed chaboneau whose feet had given out |  ze snake spen' deir summer 'cross ze mountains jes' ze odder side | she t'ink we sure to meet some on dis side to hunt ze boof'lo | mebbe furder up one leetle way | captain lewis took three men and struck out to find an indian trail and follow it into the mountains |  i'll not come back until i've met with the snakes he asserted | he was gone a long time | the shallow river full of rapids and shoals curved and forked and steadily shrank | but although sacagawea eagerly peered and murmured to herself no indians appeared | the water was icy cold from the snow range | this was middle august in extreme southwestern montana a high country | the nights were cold too | game grew scarce | three thousand miles had been logged off from st louis | unless the company could get guides and horses from the snakes and travel rapidly they would be stuck for the winter likely enough starve at any rate be forced to quit | by august 16 captain lewis had not returned | captain clark set out afoot with sacagawea and chaboneau to walk across country | the snakes simply must be found | the toiling boats rounded a great bend and a shout arose |  there's clark | he's sighted injuns hasn't he |  so has sacagawea | sure she has |see   injuns on horseback boys |hooray  for captain clark yonder up the curve was holding high his hand palm front in the peace sign | sacagawea had run ahead little toussaint bobbing in the net on her back she danced as she ran she ran back again to him sucking her fingers |  dat mean she see her own peoples | panted cruzatte the chief boatman who was a trapper and trader too and knew indians |  dere dey come on de hoss |hooray  hooray  what a relief | the indians were prancing and singing | they made the captain mount one of the horses and all hustled on for an indian camp | by the time that the hurrying canoes arrived sacagawea and another woman had rushed into each other's arms | presently they and the captain and chaboneau had entered a large lodge built of willow branches | the captain lewis squad was here too | the men had come down out of the mountains by a pass with the snakes | the snakes had been afraid of them the first white men ever seen by the band | old drouillard the hunter had argued with them in the sign language and with a few shoshoni words that he knew | it had looked like war it had looked like peace and it had looked like war and death again | finally before he could persuade them the captain had delivered over his guns and had promised them to be their prisoner if they did not find down below one of their own women acting as the white men's guide | but now all was well | the token of sacagawea saved the day | the other woman whom she hugged had been captured by the minnetarees at the same time with herself and had escaped | and the chief of the band was sacagawea's brother | he had mourned her as dead but now he and she wept together under a blanket | truly he had reason to be grateful to these white strangers who had treated her so well | much relieved by this good fortune at last the captains bought horses and hired guides | the snakes were very friendly even engaged not to disturb the canoes which were sunk with rocks in the river to await the return trip | there was little delay | the mountains should be crossed at once before winter closed the trails | to the surprise and delight of all the company sacagawea announced that she was going with them to see the great salt water | somehow she preferred the white men to her own people | she had been weeping constantly | most of her relatives and old friends had died or had been killed during her absence | her new friends she loved | they were a wonderful set these white men and the red head captain clark was the finest of all | six horses had been bought | five were packed with the supplies sacagawea and little toussaint were mounted upon the sixth and the whole company escorted by the snakes marched over the pass to chief ca me ah wait's principal camp | from there with twenty seven horses and one mule with the happy bird woman and the beady eyed toussaint the two captains and their men took the trail for the great salt water one thousand miles toward the setting sun | ah but a tough trail that proved across the bitter root mountains all up and down with scarcely a level spot to sleep on with the snow to the horses' bellies and the men's thighs with the game failing until even a horse's head was treasured as a tidbit | and the bird woman riding in the exhausted file never complained but kept her eyes fixed to the low country and the big river and the great salt water | once in the midst of starvation from her dress she fished out a small piece of bread that she had carried clear from the mandan towns | she gave it to captain clark that he might eat it | a brave and faithful heart had sacagawea | struggling down out of the mountains at the end of september they changed to canoes | the pierced noses or nez perc s indians were friendly and now on to the columbia and thence on to the sea sacagawea was the sure charm | for when the tribes saw the strange white warriors they said this cannot be a war party | they have a squaw and a papoose | we will meet with them | that winter was spent a few miles back from the pacific near the mouth of the columbia river in present washington | only once did the bird woman complain | the ocean was out of sight from the camp | chaboneau her husband seemed to think that she was made for only work work work cooking and mending and tending baby |  you stay by ze lodge fire | dat is place for womans he rebuked | whereupon sacagawea took the bit in her teeth a very unusual thing for a squaw to do and went straight to captain clark her friend |  what is the matter sacagawea | she had been crying again |  i come a long way capitin | i carry my baby i cold hungry wet seeck i come an' i no care | i show you trail i say 'snake peoples here ' an' you find snakes | you get hosses food guide | when indians see me an' my toussaint dey say 'dis no war party ' an' dey kind to you | when you get hungry for bread i gif you one leetle piece dat i carry all de way from mandan town | i try to be good woman | i work hard same as mens | now i been here all dis time near de salt water dat i trabble many days to see an' i not see it yet | my male ancestors so far as i can trace them were men of the woods hunters trappers herb gatherers | my mother was from the country educated for a teacher | she had the most inexorable will power of any woman i ever have known | from my father i inherited my love for muck on my boots resin in my nostrils the long trail the camp fire forest sounds and silences in my soul | from my mother i learned to read good books to study subjects that puzzled me to tell the truth to keep my soul and body clean and to pursue with courage the thing to which i set my hand |  there was not money enough to educate me as she would together we learned to find it in the forest | in early days we sold ferns and wild flowers to city people harvested the sap of the maples in spring and the nut crop of the fall | later as we wanted more we trapped for skins and collected herbs for the drug stores | this opened to me a field i was peculiarly fitted to enter | i knew woodcraft instinctively i had the location of every herb root bark and seed that will endure my climate i had the determination to stick to my job the right books to assist me and my mother's invincible will power to uphold me where i wavered |  as i look into your faces men i am struck with the astounding thought that some woman bore the cold sweat and pain of labour to give life to each of you | i hope few of you prolonged that agony as i did | it was in the heart of my mother to make me physically clean and to that end she sent me daily into the lake so long as it was not ice covered and put me at exercises intended to bring full strength to every sinew and fibre of my body | it was in her heart to make me morally clean so she took me to nature and drilled me in its forces and its methods of reproducing life according to the law | her work was good to a point that all men will recognize | from there on for a few years she held me not because i was man enough to stand but because she was woman enough to support me | without her no doubt i would have broken the oath i took with her i won the victory and reached years of manhood and self control as she would have had me | the struggle wore her out at half a lifetime but as a tribute to her memory i cannot face a body of men having your opportunities without telling you that what was possible to her and to me is possible to all mothers and men | if she is above and hears me perhaps it will recompense some of her shortened years if she knows i am pleading with you as men having the greatest influence of any living to tell and to teach the young that a clean life is possible to them | the next time any of you are called upon to address a body of men tell them to learn for themselves and to teach their sons and to hold them at the critical hour even by sweat and blood to a clean life for in this way only can feeble minded homes almshouses and the scarlet woman be abolished | in this way only can men arise to full physical and mental force and become the fathers of a race to whom the struggle for clean manhood will not be the battle it is with us |  by the distorted faces by the misshapen bodies by marks of degeneracy recognizable to your practised eyes everywhere on the streets by the agony of the mother who bore you and later wept over you i conjure you men to live up to your high and holy privilege and tell all men that they can be clean if they will | this in memory of the mother who shortened her days to make me a moral man | another statue has been erected in the state capitol at bismarck north dakota | so although all the wages went to her husband she knows that the white people of the great united states remember the loving services of the brave little bird woman who without the promise of pay helped carry the flag to the pacific | young captain lewis the long knife chief and stout captain clark the red head who with their exploring party wintered among the mandans in 1804 1805 and enlisted the snake bird woman as guide were the first white men to write a clear account of the curious mandans but they did not tell the half | for a curious people indeed were these mandans dwelling in two villages on the missouri river above present washburn in central north dakota | they were polite hospitable and brave | their towns were defended by ditches and loose timber palisades not tight like those of the iroquois and hurons | their houses were circular of an earthern floor sunk two feet and heavy six foot logs set on end inside the edge of it with a roof of timbers woven willow and thick mud plaster with a sunken fire place under a hole in the center of the roof and with bunks screened by elk hides or buffalo robes along the walls | these houses were large enough to shelter twenty to forty persons the roofs were favorite loafing spots for men women and dogs | the mandans formed a happy talkative people of strange appearance but exceedingly clean fond of bathing either in the river or in wicker tubs | their hair was heavy sometimes reached to the ground and was black brown and frequently gray or pure white even on the young | their eyes were likely to be hazel blue or gray instead of black their skin almost white | they made glassy clay vases and bowls and remarkable blue glass beads | in fact they seemed to have white manners white arts and white blood | rumor asserted that they were partly welsh descended from the lost colony of the welsh prince madoc | now this madoc a prince of the early welsh people set sail about the year 1180 with ten ships to found a colony in a new western continent that he claimed to have discovered | he never was heard from | he and his ten shiploads vanished | but if he reached north america and traveled inland to be swallowed up amidst the red blood the strange mandans may have been the proof of his arrival | their round boats of bowl like wicker work covered with hide and their way of dipping the paddle from the front instead of from the rear were exactly the welsh method of canoe travel | in the days of mah to toh pa the mandans numbered two thousand in two towns allied with the towns of the minnetarees | they were beset by the tough winter traveling assiniboins to the north and by the treacherous arikarees and the bold sioux to the south | therefore when in 1833 the wandering artist george catlin of pennsylvania who spent eight years painting indians in their homes all the way from florida to the rocky mountains made a long stay among the mandans they rejoiced him by their brave tales as well as with their curious habits | according to all the reports the bravest of the braves in the mandan towns was mahtotohpa second chief by rank but first of all by deeds |  free generous elegant and gentlemanly in his deportment handsome brave and valiant says artist catlin | such words speak well for four bears but not a bit too well | before he arrived at the artist catlin lodge to have his portrait painted the warning ran ahead of him: mahtotohpa is coming in full dress | he was escorted by a great throng of admiring women and children | now it was twelve o'clock noon and he had been since early morning getting ready so as to appear as befitted a noble chief | his dress was complete: shirt leggins moccasins head dress necklace belt robe medicine bag tobacco sack pipe quiver bow knife lance shield tomahawk and war club | and as he proudly stood erect waiting he made a splendid sight | his shirt was mountain sheep skins one before one behind sewed together at their edges | they were embroidered with porcupine quills brightly dyed and fringed with the black scalp locks of the enemies whom he had slain in combat and tasseled with ermine tails | they were pictured with his deeds painted in sign language | the leggins were of finely dressed deer skin worked with the porcupine quills fringed with the scalp locks and fitting tightly from moccasins to thighs | the moccasins were of buck skin armored with the dyed quills | the head dress was a crest of two polished buffalo horns set in a thick mat of ermine from which fell clear to his heels a ridgy tail of countless eagle plumes also set in the ermine fur | the necklace was of fifty grizzly bear claws strung from otter skin | the belt was of tanned buck skin supporting tomahawk and broad bladed scalping knife with elk horn haft | the robe slung from his shoulders like a roman toga was the softened hide of a young buffalo bull worn fur side in and on the white skin side all the battles of his life had been painted | the medicine bag was a beaver skin ornamented with hawk bills and ermine | he held it in his right hand | his tobacco sack was of otter skin decorated with porcupine quills | in it were dried red willow bark flint and steel and tinder | his pipe was of curiously carved red pipe stone from the peace quarries in present minnesota | the stem was ash three feet long wound with porcupine quills to form pictures of men and animals decorated with wood peckers' skins and heads and the hair of the white buffalo's tail | it was half painted red and notched for the years of his life | his quiver was of panther skin and filled with arrows flint pointed and steel pointed and some bloody | his bow was of strips of elk horn polished white cemented with glue of buffalo hoof and backed with deer sinews to give it spring | three months had been required to make it | there was none better | his lance had a deadly two edge steel blade stained with the dried blood of sioux and arikaree and cheyenne and assiniboin | the six foot ashen shaft was strung with eagle feathers | his shield was the hide from a buffalo's neck hardened with hoof glue | its center was a pole cat skin its edges were fringed with eagle feathers and antelope hoofs that rattled | his battle axe was of hammered iron blade and skull pecker with ash handle four feet long and deer sinew grip | eagle feathers and fur tufts decorated it | his war club was a round stone wrapped in raw hide at the end of a cow tail like a policeman's billy | after his portrait was painted mahtotohpa spread out his wonderful robe and told the stories of the twelve battles and the fourteen scalps pictured on it by his own hand and these stories included that of his arikaree lance and cheyenne knife | the lance story came about in this way | in the shaft of the lance near the blade there had been set an antelope prong and when mahtotohpa posed for his portrait with the butt of the lance proudly planted on the ground he carefully balanced an eagle feather across this prong |  do not omit to paint that feather exactly as it is he said and the spot of blood upon it | it is great medicine and belongs to the great spirit not to me | i pulled it from the wound of an enemy |  why do you not tie it to the lance then | hush  rebuked mahtotohpa |  if the great spirit had wished it to be tied on it would never have come off | whereupon presently he told the story of the mighty lance | this had been the lance of a famous arikaree warrior won ga tap | some years back maybe seven or eight the mandans and the arikarees had met on horses near the mandan towns and had fought | the mandans chased the arikarees but after the chase the brother of mahtotohpa did not come in | several days passed and when mahtotohpa himself found his brother it was only the body scalped and cut and pierced with an arrow and fastened through the heart to the prairie by the lance of won ga tap | many in the village recognized that as the lance of won ga tap | mahtotohpa did not clean it of its blood but held it aloft before all the village and swore that he would clean it only with the blood of wongatap the arikaree | he sent a challenge to the arikarees and for four years he waited keeping the lance and hoping to use it as he had promised | finally his heart had grown so sore that he was bursting and again holding the lance up before the village he made a speech |  mahtotohpa is going | let nobody speak his name or ask where he is or try to seek him | he will return with fresh blood on this lance or he will not return at all | he set out alone on foot like piskaret the adirondack had set out in his great adventure against the iroquois | by night journeys he traveled two hundred miles living on the parched corn in his pouch until he was seven days hungry when at last he came to the arikaree town where the lodge of wongatap was located | he knew the village well for there had been brief periods when the mandans and the arikarees were at peace besides it was a warrior's business to know an enemy's lodges | the arikaree towns were much the same as the mandan towns | now mahtotohpa lay outside and watched until at dusk he might slip through between the pickets and seek the lodge of wongatap | he was enveloped in a buffalo robe covering his head so that he would be taken for an arikaree | he peeped through a crack in the wongatap lodge and saw that his enemy was getting ready for bed | there he was wongatap himself sitting with his wife in the fire light and smoking his last pipe | pretty soon as the fire flickered out he rapped the ashes from his pipe his wife raked the coals of the fire together until morning and now they two crawled into their bunk | hotly grasping his lance and surrounded by the enemy mahtotohpa delayed a little space then he arose and boldly stalked into the lodge and sat by the fire | over the coals was hanging a pot of cooked meat beside the fire were the pipe and the pouch of red willow smoking tobacco just as left by wongatap | amidst the dusk mahtotohpa ate well of the cooked meat and filling the pipe smoked calmly half lying down on one elbow |  who is that man who enters our lodge and eats of our food and smokes of our tobacco | he heard wongatap's wife ask |  it is no matter wongatap replied |  if he is hungry let him eat | that was right | by indian law a person in need may enter any lodge and eat and no questions shall be asked until he has finished | mahtotohpa's heart almost failed him | had that not been the killer of his brother he would only have left a challenge and gone away | but he thought of his brother and his vows and his heart closed again | when his pipe was smoked out he laid it aside and gently stirred the fire with the toe of his moccasin for more light | he dared to wait no longer | on a sudden he grasped his lance with both hands sprang up and drove it through the body of wongatap in the bunk | with his knife he instantly snatched off the scalp | then he uttered the mandan scalp halloo and dived for the door | there he paused for just a second to look back that the squaw might see his face and in the glimmer of fire light he noted a feather from the lance sticking in the hole in wongatap's side | so back he darted plucked the feather and carrying it in his left hand that the great spirit might help him he ran hard | wongatap's wife was shrieking all the village heard and answered and the warriors streamed out of the lodges | the whole night mahtotohpa ran while the arikarees vainly searched for his trail | this day he hid in the brush along the missouri river | the next night he ran again and on the sixth morning he panted into the mandan town with the dried blood of wongatap on his lance's blade and the stiffened scalp of wongatap hanging to its handle | so that was why he cherished the lance and that was why he considered the loose eagle's feather to be a strong medicine from the great spirit | but this was only number six in the twelve recorded deeds of four bears | his next biggest deed was as follows and it is bigger according to white man's way of thinking | by that deed he won his knife | early one morning one hundred and fifty cheyenne warriors attacked the mandan town | they took a scalp and many horses before they rode away | the mandans had been surprised but mahtotohpa rallied fifty warriors and pursued | the fifty warriors led by mahtotohpa pursued for a day and half a day | at noon they sighted the cheyennes driving the stolen horses but the cheyennes were so numerous that the mandan warriors lost their hearts and wished to turn back | not so mahtotohpa | he galloped forward alone he planted his lance in the earth to the full length of the blade and making a circle around it with his horse he tore from his clothing a strip of red cloth and hung that to the lance shaft for a banner |  if you are cowards you may go back to the women he called to his men |  i stay here where my lance is firm in the ground | his men were ashamed and hesitated | now the cheyennes had turned and were coming for battle | their chief saw the planted lance of mahtotohpa and mahtotohpa waiting beside it and he galloped forward alone on his white horse |  who is it that has stuck down his lance and defies the cheyennes | he shouted |  i am mahtotohpa |  that is good | mahtotohpa is a chief | does he dare to fight |  is this a chief who speaks to mahtotohpa |  i wear scalps at my horse's bit and the eagle's feathers |  you have said enough replied mahtotohpa | come  let us meet | forward hammered the cheyenne chief riding splendidly in circles until he dashed in and planted his lance also at the side of mahtotohpa's lance | that was his answer | they each drew off a little way while the mandan warriors and the cheyenne warriors gazed expectant | then they charged like knights in a tournament and shot at the same moment with their guns | after they had passed each other and had wheeled mahtotohpa held up his powder horn | the cheyenne's bullet had smashed it so that the powder had flowed out | having shown mahtotohpa flung away his horn threw his gun to the ground and setting his buffalo hide shield upon his left arm deliberately strung his bow and placed an arrow upon the string | the cheyenne chief was a mighty warrior | he likewise cast aside his powder horn and gun adjusted his painted shield prepared bow and arrow | again they charged | they circled swiftly about each other performing many clever feats of horsemanship while their stout bows twanged so fast that the arrows crisscrossed like darting bees | some thudded into the thick shields and the shields bristled with the feathered ends | some found legs and arms but that mattered little | now mahtotohpa's horse reeled and fell an arrow in his heart | mahtotohpa sprang nimbly off | and off from his own horse sprang the cheyenne chief that he might not have the advantage | they plied their bows on foot | soon the brave cheyenne stripped his quiver from his left shoulder and flourished it | it was empty | he tossed it away and tossed away bow and shield | then he drew his knife | ai  responded mahtotohpa gladly and ridding himself of shield and quiver he rushed forward feeling for his knife too | but his knife was not in his belt | he had lost it or left it at home |hah  he could not stop they had come together the cheyenne was upon him | so he fought with his bow | he struck aside the cheyenne's thrust and hit him over the head and knocked him down | they grappled | it was a terrible fight | mahtotohpa clutched for the knife and the sharp blade was wrenched through his hand cutting to the bone | the cheyenne stabbed him many times and many times mahtotohpa clutched the knife blade again before he could tear the haft from the cheyenne's fingers | but suddenly he succeeded and the cheyenne died | the warriors of both parties had formed a circle close about watching | mahtotohpa staggered up with the cheyenne's scalp and knife and gave the kill whoop and thus victory rested with the mandans | that was mahtotohpa's most famous battle | in another battle he got his name four bears | the assiniboins had put all his warriors to flight but he stood his ground and shot his gun and killed an assiniboin and charged with lance and shield and made them run off | he took sixty horses besides the scalp | after this he was called four bears because the assiniboins said that he charged like four bears in one | his worst wound he received from the sioux | they shot an arrow clear through his body so that the arrow continued on dropping blood | but he lashed his horse forward against them and won another victory | such honorable scars he kept covered with red paint that all who saw might read | these stories and others as pictured by the robe mahtotohpa told to artist catlin while indian trader james kipp translated the words and four bears acted out the scenes and they three sat upon the robe itself | the cheyenne chief's knife he gave to artist catlin | he also made a copy of the pictures on another robe and the knife and the second robe were sent to the catlin indian gallery at washington where they doubtless may be seen at this day | mahtotohpa's end came to him as follows: in the summer of 1837 a great death attacked the mandan towns | it was the small pox | the sioux hedged the towns so closely that there was no escape into the prairie | the mandan men women and children thus herded together died by hundreds | mahtotohpa was among the last left | he witnessed all his family and friends stretched cold and lifeless and he decided to try a sacrifice to the anger of the great spirit | so he dragged his wives and children together and covered them decently with buffalo robes | then he went out to a little hill and laid himself down with a vow not to eat or drink if the great spirit would stay the plague | on the sixth day he was very weak but he crept back to his lodge and again laid himself down in a robe beside his family | and on the ninth day he too died | however the plague was not stayed for many days | of the sixteen hundred mandans in the two towns only thirty one remained alive of all the mandan nation there were scarce above one hundred and today they number about one hundred and fifty | but as the pierced noses this nation in the far northwest was known | they were members of the sha hap ti an family of north americans a family not so large as the algonquian siouan shoshonean and several other families yet important | their home was the valley and river country of western idaho and the near sections of oregon and washington | the two captains lewis and clark were well treated by them along the great snake river above the entrance to the greater columbia | they were a small indian a horse indian who lived on buffalo as well as fish and scorned to eat dog like the sioux a brave fighting indian and withal a very honest wise minded indian whose boast up to 1877 was that they had never shed the white man's blood | they used canoes but they used horses more | horses were their wealth | they raised horses by the thousand and the finest of horses these were | a fat colt was good meat but without horses they could not hunt the buffalo and the buffalo supplied stronger meat | once a year when the grass had greened in the spring they traveled eastward across the rocky mountains by the pierced nose trail to the buffalo and hunted upon the missouri river plains in the country of their enemies the blackfeet | the blackfeet in turn sought them out west of the mountains to steal their horses | with the blackfeet and the sioux and sometimes with the snakes they fought many a battle and when they had anything of a show they won out | it took numbers to whip a pierced nose warrior | like most peace lovers he made the hardest kind of a fighter | the early whites in the northwest had nothing but praise for the pierced nose indians | the trapper who married a pierced nose woman thought that he was lucky | she would be a good wife for him gentle neat and always busy | besides as a rule the nez perc s women were better looking than the general run of indian women | the early fur hunters and explorers found that the pierced noses were very religious in a way akin to the christian way | they did not eat drink nor sleep without first giving thanks to god | they had one day each week like sunday when they did not hunt or fish or work but listened to talks by their priests or medicine men | it was said that they had been taught first by a christian iroquois indian who in 1816 came in from canada and told them the things that he had been told by the french priests | at any rate when the roman catholic priests themselves arrived to live among them these pierced noses already had learned a great deal | they were anxious to learn more | however before the missionaries of any church visited them the pierced noses tried to learn more by themselves | in particular they wanted a copy of the book of heaven | and what started them on the trail of the book of heaven was this: among the leaders of white fur hunters in beaver trapping days in the west there was trapper captain jedediah s smith the knight in buckskin | this captain jedediah smith was fearless and upright | hunting beaver he traveled far and wide from the missouri river to california and from new mexico to the columbia protected only by his rifle and his bible | wherever he carried his rifle he carried his bible used them both and no man but that respected him | the comanches of the southwest finally killed him in 1831 when fighting alone against great odds he died a real hero's death | he had spent the winter of 1824 1825 in the pierced noses' country | of course he told them much about the white man's religion | they saw him frequently reading in his little black leather book which they said must be the white man's book of heaven | he would not sell them the book for any amount of horses or beaver skins | when he had left they took counsel together and decided that they should get such a book | twice they sent into the east for it and no word came back | but the pierced noses did not give up | they were still without the wonderful book of heaven which had said captain jedediah smith the trapper guided the white men on the straight trail to the great spirit above | in the early part of 1832 they called a council of the nation and chose four men to set out again for the big unknown village where dwelt the red head chief and where they hoped a copy of the book of heaven might be found | the snows had scarcely melted when the four men started | two of them were old and wise their names are not written | two of them were young and strong their names were rabbit skin leggins and no horns on his head | a long long dangerous road lay before them: three thousand miles across the mountains into the blackfeet country and across the plains guarded by the blackfeet and the sioux and other hungry people as bad | but they got through all right for they were clever and in earnest | they arrived at st louis in the summer | st louis was then nothing like the st louis of today but to the four strangers from the columbia river basin it was amazingly large | never had they dreamed of seeing so many white people | no one spoke their tongue still there were trappers and missouri river boatmen who understood signs and by the sign language they inquired for the red head chief | the kind hearted governor william clark was glad to greet them | their fathers almost thirty years before had helped him and captain lewis the long knife he remembered the two old men when they were young | the indians of the west might always depend upon their friend the red head | so he took charge of the four pierced noses and entertained them | he showed them the sights of the white man's big village beside the big rivers | they were entertained by banquets and balls and the theatre | they went to services in the roman catholic church where the white people worshipped for governor clark was a catholic | and they saw copies of the book of heaven the roman catholic testament and the bible: but the books did not speak their language | in all the white man's village there was no one who might read from the book in their own language | after a few months they began to despair | the food of the white man and the close air of the lodges made them ill | the two old men died | rabbit skin leggins and no horns on his head were homesick for their country beyond the mountains | in the winter they prepared to go | a farewell banquet was given to them but they were tired of banquets | they wanted a book of heaven that could talk to them | no horns on his head delivered a speech as best he might in sign language and broken english through an interpreter | i have come to you over the trail of many moons from the setting sun | you were the friends of my fathers who have all gone the long way | i came with an eye partly open for my people who sit in darkness i go back with both eyes closed | how can i go back blind to my blind people | i made my way to you with strong arms through many enemies and strange lands that i might carry back much to them | i go back with both arms broken and empty | two fathers came with us they were the braves of many winters and wars | we leave them asleep here by your great waters and wigwams | they were tired in many moons and their moccasins wore out | my people sent me to get the white man's book of heaven | you took me to where you allow your women to dance as we do not ours and the book was not there | you took me to where they worship the great spirit with candles and the book was not there | you showed me images of the good spirits and the picture of the good land beyond but the book was not among them to tell us the way | i am going back the long and sad trail to my people in the dark land | you make my feet heavy with gifts and my moccasins will grow old carrying them yet the book is not among them | when i tell my poor blind people after one more snow in the big council that i did not bring the book no word will be spoken by our old men or by our young braves | one by one they will rise and go out in silence | my people will die in darkness and they will go a long path to other hunting grounds | no white man will go with them and no white man's book make the way plain | i have no more words | they left | rabbit skin leggins reached his people no horns on his head fell upon the trail and died | but his words lived | as translated into english they were printed in eastern papers and aroused great desire among the churches to give them the right answer | should these indians beyond the mountains remain in darkness |no  missionaries were called for to carry the book and the word to the columbia river | in the spring of 1834 the first party of four methodists set out others followed the next year soon the roman catholic church sent its black robes and the pierced noses and their kin the flatheads were made glad | not in vain had their warriors died while seeking the road to the white man's heaven | today there are in the united states about one thousand of them | but when they were a free and powerful people they numbered as high as ten thousand and ranged far from the missouri river in northern north dakota and northern montana clear into canada above | this cold high country of vast plains made them hardy and roaming | in their proud bearing and good size they resembled the dakota sioux but with the sioux they had little to do except in war | they were at war with the mandans also and other nations to the south | in the north they mingled with the ojibwas or chippewa people who had journeyed westward into canada | the ojibwas had given them their name as si i bo in meaning they cook with stones | the assiniboins were horse indians and buffalo hunters | they had two peculiar customs | they did cook their meat with stones just as the chippewas said | instead of using kettles they used holes | they dug a hole about the size of a large kettle then they pressed a square of raw buffalo hide into it for a lining | this they filled with water they put their meat in and heating stones dropped them in too until the water was boiling | their other peculiarity lay in their style of hair | the longer the hair the better | they divided it into strands and plastered the strands with a paste of red earth and hoof glue in sections of an inch or two | when the hair did not grow long enough to suit they spliced it by gluing on other hair sometimes horse hair until it reached the ground | in the year 1831 wi jun jon or pigeon's egg head was a leading young warrior among the long haired assiniboins | it was a custom of those days to have chiefs and warriors from the various indian tribes sent to washington to talk with their white father and see how the americans lived | this was supposed to teach the indians the value of white man's ways and to show them how useless was war with the white race | the assiniboins were still a wild people | they were located so far from st louis that they knew nothing about white man ways except such as they noticed at the fur trading posts and here the ways were mixed with indian ways | so in the fall of this year major j f a sanborn the indian agent at the american fur company's trading post of fort union where on the border between north dakota and montana the yellowstone river empties into the missouri river decided to take a party of indians to washington | the assiniboins the cheyennes the blackfeet the crows they all came to fort union to trade their furs for powder lead sugar and blankets | major sanborn asked the assiniboins for a warrior | they appointed wijunjon and another | now this was to be a long journey among strangers | to be sure from the mandans down river old sha ha ka or white head had made the trip in 1806 when the red head chief and the long knife chief were bound home from the salty water and he had returned unharmed | others had gone since from the upper missouri and others had died sha ha ka himself had almost been killed by the sioux | nobody had gone yet from as far away as the assiniboin country therefore young wijunjon feared but was brave | he bade his wife chin cha pee or fire bug that creeps and his little children goodby and with the other assiniboin and chiefs from the blackfeet and crows set out on a fur company flatboat under protection of major sanborn | the assiniboin women on the shore wept and wailed | his people scarcely expected to see him again | it was one thousand miles by river through the enemies of his nation thence on to the great village of st louis but he passed in safety | and when he began to see the first smaller villages of the americans in missouri wijunjon started in to count the houses so that he might tell his people | he had promised to report everything | he commenced to count by making notches in his pipe stem one notch for every lodge | the cabins became thicker along the river banks and his comrade needs must call off the lodges while he made the notches | soon there was no more space on the pipe stem and wijunjon changed to his war club | speedily he had filled this also | luckily the barge tied up at the shore while dinner was cooked | this gave him chance to cut a long willow stick which surely would be enough | in fact so certain he was that the end of the white man's lodges must be close before them that he worked hard to recut the pipe stem notches and the war club notches in his willow stick to have all together | but this very day he had filled the willow stick and the lodges before them seemed more numerous than those behind | ere they arrived in sight of st louis itself he and his comrade had an arm load of willow sticks all filled with notches | and here was st louis | how many people | fifteen thousand | how many lodges | thousands of lodges | pigeon's egg head pitched the bundle of willow sticks over board | his knife was worn out and his hand and brain were tired | at st louis he stood for his portrait painted by the same artist catlin who the next year in the mandan towns listened to the hero tales of mah to toh pa | he was a great man at painting indians this artist catlin | wijunjon was somewhat confused by so many sounds and sights but he made a fine figure of a chief in his mountain goat skin leggins and shirt decorated with porcupine quills and with scalp locks from his enemies his long plaited hair which reached to the ground his war bonnet of eagles' plumes his buffalo hide robe painted with the battles of his career his beautiful moccasins and his quiver and bow and bull neck shield | having had his portrait painted he continued on the long trail of two thousand more miles by water and by stage to washington | and as every mile of it was amidst still more lodges of the white man he soon saw that all the willow sticks of the missouri river could not have counted their numbers | this winter wijunjon and his companions had a wonderful time among the white men | the pigeon's egg head was the foremost | he was the first to shake the hand of the great white father | he declined nothing | the sights of washington baltimore philadelphia new york he inspected them all | he scarcely rested night or day | he learned so much that when in the spring of 1832 he turned homeward he was filled to bursting | at st louis the first through steamboat the yellowstone was waiting to ascend to fort union and the assiniboin country | artist catlin was aboard | this was to be his first trip also | the steamboat yellowstone made a huge sensation as it ploughed the thick muddy current of the missouri frightening the indians and buffalo along the shores | it moved without sweeps it nosed for the deepest channels and the indians called it big medicine canoe with eyes | it spoke with its guns and belched much smoke and they called it big thunder canoe | but wijunjon feared not at all | he was used to thunder canoes now and he had seen many great sights back there in the villages of the white men | in fact he was a sight himself for on the way up he had changed his clothes that his people might know hint for a wide traveler | gone were his fringed and quilled goat skin leggins and shirt gone his war bonnet and painted robe and handsome moccasins his bow and quiver and shield | instead he wore a badly fitting colonel's uniform of the united states army given to him by the great white father: wrinkled trousers and coat of bright blue with gilt epaulets upon the shoulders and a stiff collar that reached above his ears | atop his long painted hair there was settled to the coat collar a stove pipe hat with a silver braid band and a red wool plume two feet high | his feet were squeezed into high heeled military boots of shiny leather | around his neck was a tight black stock or collar | around his waist was a red sash | upon his hands were loose white cotton gloves | upon his chest and the ruffles of a white shirt dangled a silver medal on a blue ribbon | hung by a belt across one shoulder at his log dangled a huge broad sword | in one hand he carried a blue umbrella in the other a fan and in his arms a keg of rum | thus wijunjon the big brave proudly strode the deck of the steamer yellowstone and impatiently looked forward to the moment when he might step off among his people | the moment came | two thousand indians had gathered on the prairie at fort union to greet the thunder canoe and the returning travelers | wijunjon led the procession down the gang plank | it was not indian etiquet to make an ado over the return | wijunjon was roundly eyed but nobody spoke to him | his wife the fire bug that creeps was here so were his children who scarcely knew him so were his old parents | he felt that he was admired and that his family and friends were glad to see him but they let him alone and he only stalked about in his glory whistling the american war cry of yankee doodle | after due time of course they all loosened up | this night in his lodge in the assiniboin village he commenced to tell his stories | but he could not tell one tenth and yet with the very first several of the old men and chiefs arose and went out | they said that this wijunjon was a liar and that they would not listen to him | the white people were known to be great liars and he had learned from them | in vain the next day and the next day the pigeon's egg head tried to make himself popular | first he let his wife cut off the tails of his frock coat to fashion herself a pair of nice blue leggins | his silver lace hat band she took for garters | the rest of his coat he gave to his brother and now he wore his white shirt with the tails outside | he gave away his boots which hurt his feet | he gave away the tails of his shirt also his brass studs and sleeve buttons | and with his keg of rum and his broad sword dragging and tripping him he paid visits from lodge to lodge and whistled yankee doodle | pretty soon he had nothing left but his blue umbrella | that was the only thing he kept | even his hat was gone his sword was used by his wife as a meat chopper | and still he was not popular | each night men and women gathered from near and far to hear him talk in his lodge | they sat silent and critical while he told them the honest truth | he worked very hard | he labored to describe the long journey and the marvelous number of white man's lodges and villages and the stage coaches and the railroads the forts and the ships of many big guns and the tremendous council house at washington and the patent office great medicine place filled with curious machines and the war parade of american soldiers and the balloon a huge ball which carried a man to the great spirit in the sky and the beautiful white squaws with red cheeks | the people listened and when they went out they said among themselves: those things are not true | the pigeon's egg head is the greatest liar in the world | the other nations will laugh at the assiniboins | wijunjon did not despair | he was so full of words that he simply must talk or burst | he wished that he might bring forward the other assiniboin who had been with him and who knew that all these stories were true but the other assiniboin had died on the way home | that was too bad | however he stuck to his stories for he knew that he was right | his people had sent him to see and he had seen and he spoke only true words | after a while the assiniboins took a different view of wijunjon | any person who had such stories in his brain was certainly great medicine | no common liar could invent these stories about impossible wonders | yes wijunjon was doubtless taught by a spirit | he had dreamed | now the assiniboin people looked upon wijunjon with awe and fear | a person equipped with such power might be very dangerous | they decided that he ought to be killed | meanwhile wijunjon went right on telling his stories | he still had hopes and besides it was pleasant to be the center of a gaping circle and to walk around with folks gazing so at him | there was a young man who agreed to rid the assiniboins of this wizard | beyond question wijunjon was too great medicine to be killed by an ordinary bullet another way should be found | this young man also was a dreamer | and in his dreams he was told he said how to kill wijunjon | the wizard must be shot with an iron pot handle | nothing else would do the work | accordingly the young man appointed to kill wijunjon for being bad medicine found an iron pot handle and spent a whole day filing it down to fit into the muzzle of his gun | then from behind he shot the terrible pigeon's egg head and scattered his lying brains about and the wizard fell dead | chapter xx the blackfeet defy the crows 1834 come and take us southwest from the mandans there lived the crow nation | they roved through the yellowstone river country of southern montana to the rocky mountains and southward through the mountains into the wind river and big horn country of western wyoming | west from the mandans there lived the blackfeet nation | they roved through the missouri country of northern montana and north into canada | the land of the crows and of the blackfeet overlapped | the two peoples were at war on the plains and in the mountains | by reason of their wars the crow nation had shrunk until they were down to seven thousand people with many more women than men | but their warriors were tall and stately their women industrious their garb elegant | their buffalo hide lodges and their buffalo robe clothing were the whitest finest in the west | they had countless horses | and the long hair of their men set them high in dignity | oiled every morning with bear's grease the hair of a proud crow warrior swept the ground behind him | the hair of chief long hair measured ten feet seven inches and rolled into a bunch it weighed several pounds | when it had turned white he worshipped it as his medicine | the crows' name for themselves was ab sa ro ke sparrow hawk people | they were of the siouan family and cousins of the minnetarees the bird woman's captors | they had no villages except where they camped | they were dark as high and mighty in their bearing as the mohawks or senecas were wonderful riders and looked upon the white men not as worthy enemies but as persons who should be plundered of horses and goods | in the white men's camps they were polite and took away with them whatever they could | however many white traders spoke well of the crows | the name of the blackfeet was sik sik a which means the same | it referred to their black moccasins | they were algonquins and in power ranked with the iroquois of the east | the blackfeet the bloods and the piegans formed the league of the siksika nation | they warred right and left with the crees the assiniboins the sioux the crows the pierced noses and with practically all tribes they were hostile to the white americans who hunted in their country but their wars had not cut them down for they numbered close to forty thousand people | like the crows their enemy neighbors they were rovers never staying long in one spot | they were unlike the crows in appearance being shorter broad shouldered and deep chested | no warriors were more feared | in november of 1834 amidst the wind river mountains of western wyoming five hundred crows were ahorse at early morning to chase the buffalo | and a gallant sight they made as they rode gaily out in their white robes their long plaited hair flying their best horses prancing under them and decorated with red streamers | chief grizzly bear led | chief long hair now almost eighty years of age was with another band | in this chief grizzly bear band there rode a party of white beaver hunters who were to spend the winter with the crows | they now were to be shown how the crows killed buffalo | pretty soon while the crows cantered on they sighted a group of moving figures at the base of the hills two or three miles distant across the valley | everybody stopped short to peer |buffalo no  indians on foot and in a hurry blackfeet | how from so far away the crows could tell that these were blackfeet the white men did not know | but with a yell of joy and rage every crow lashed his horse and forward they all dashed racing to catch the hated blackfeet | the white hunters followed hard | it was to be an indian battle instead of an indian buffalo chase | the blackfeet numbered less than one hundred | they were a war party | were they hunting buffalo they would have been on horseback but even among the horse indians the war parties were likely to travel on foot so as to be able to hide more easily | they counted upon stealing horses for the homeward trail | these blackfeet had been very rash but that was blackfoot nature | they had sighted the crows as soon as the crows had sighted them and were hustling at best speed to get back into the hills | the crows whooping gladly and expecting to make short work of their enemies first made short work of the distance | their robes were dropped their guns loaded their bows were strung they spread out wider the blackfeet were cut off and desperately scrambling up a rocky slope could never make it never never they had halted what were they doing |aha  from the hill slope there arose answering whoops a few guns cracked and at the base and half way up the crows stopped and gazed and yelled | the plucky blackfeet had forted | they were in a natural fort of rock wall | on either side of them a rock out crop in a ridge four feet high extended up hill to meet near the top a cross ridge ten feet high | while half the warriors defended with guns and bows the other half were busily piling up brush and boulders to close the down hill opening | now whoop answered whoop and threat answered threat while the crows rode around and around at safe distance seeking a weak place | chief grizzly bear held council with the sub chiefs | away sped an express to get reinforcements from the camp | at the first charge upon the fort three crows had been killed and only one blackfoot | that would never do: three scalps in trade for one was a poor count to the crows | they were five hundred the blackfeet were only ninety but the crows held off waiting their reinforcements while from their fort the blackfeet yelled taunt after taunt |  bring up your squaws' | let them lead you | but our scalps will never dry in a crow lodge | here at last came the people from the camp: the old men women boys everybody who could mount a horse and who could find a weapon all shrieking madly until the whole valley rang with savage cries | matters looked bad for the blackfeet | at least two thousand crows were surrounding them hooting at them shaking guns and bows and spears at them | and the blackfeet secure in their fort jeered back | they were brave warriors | chief grizzly bear called another council | in spite of all the gesturing and whooping and firing of guns the blackfeet were unharmed | the crows had little heart for charging in upon the muzzles of those deadly pieces with the fierce blackfeet behind | the white beaver hunters not wishing to anger the blackfeet and curious to see what was about to happen withdrew to a clump of cedar trees about two hundred yards from the fort | the white men had decided to be spectators in a grand stand | presently chief grizzly bear and his chiefs seemed to have agreed upon a plan of battle | had they been white men themselves they would have stormed the fort at once and carried the fight to close quarters but that was not indian way | to lose a warrior was a serious matter | warriors were not made in a day | and without warriors a tribe would soon perish |  he who fights and runs away may live to fight another day was the indians' motto | they preferred to play safe | now the crows formed in line two or three hundred abreast and charged as if they were intending to run right over the fort | it was a great sight | but it did not frighten the blackfeet | up the hill slope galloped the crow warriors and boys shooting and yelling | the stout blackfeet crouched behind their barricade volleyed back and long before the crows drove their charge home it broke | soon several more crow warriors were lying on the field | the wails of the squaws sounded loudly | no blackfeet had been hurt | the crows changed their tactics | they avoided the fort until they had gained the top of the hill | then in a long single file they tore past that end of the fort letting fly with bullet and arrow as they sped by | each warrior threw himself to the opposite side of his horse and hanging there with only one arm and one leg exposed to the fort shot under his horse's neck | it was an endless chain of riders shuttling past the fort and shooting but that did not work | the blackfeet arrows and bullets caught the horses and once in a while a rider and soon there were ten crows down | the crows quit to rest their horses and to talk | their women were wailing still more loudly | war was hard on the women too | for every relative killed they had to cut off a finger joint besides gashing their faces and hands with knives | in their little fort the blackfeet were as boldly defiant as ever |  come and take us | they gibed |  where are the crow men | we thought we saw crow men among you | come and take us but you will never take us alive |  what will be done now | the white men queried of a black man who had joined them in the clump of cedars | he was not all black | he was half white one quarter negro and one quarter cherokee | he had lived over twenty years in the indian country of the upper missouri river mainly with the crows | edward rose had been his name when young but now he was a wrinkled stout old man called cut nose and looked like a crinkly headed indian |  the crows are losing too many warriors | they have no stomach for that kind of work answered the old squaw man | the crow chiefs and braves were seated in a circle near the cedars and listening to the speakers who stood up one after another |  our marrow bones are broken some asserted |  the enemy is in a fort we are outside | we will lose more men than he | let us draw off and when he is in the open we can then attack as we please |  he is few we are many | our slain warriors and their women cry for vengeance asserted others |  we will be called cowards if we retreat | if we charge all together we may lose a few braves but there will be no blackfeet left to laugh at us | these seemed to be the voices that carried | the pipe was passed around the circle every man puffed at it and the council broke up in a tremendous yelling | now the end of the blackfeet loomed large | ahorse and afoot the crows massed to charge from below and on either flank | their chiefs hastened hither and thither urging them | the women and children shrieked encouragement | in their little fort the blackfeet also listened to their chiefs | they showed not the slightest sign of fear | their fierce faces glared over the ramparts | their weapons were held firmly | the crows had aroused themselves to such a pitch that they acted half insane | forward they charged in howling masses but the bullets and arrows pelted them thickly more warriors fell they scattered and ran away | the blackfeet hooted them | this made old cut nose mad | he hastened out to where the crows were collected in doubt what next to do and climbed upon a rock that they all might see him | listen  he shouted |  you act as if you expected to kill the enemy with your noise | your voices are big and your hearts are small | these white men see that the crows cannot protect their hunting grounds they will not trade with a nation of cowards and women they will trade with the blackfeet who own the country | the blackfeet will go home and tell the people that three thousand crows could not take ninety warriors | after this no nation will have anything to do with the crows | i am ashamed to be found among the crows | i told the white men that you could fight | now i will show you how black men and white men can fight | and he leaped from his rock and without glancing behind him he ran for the fort | the crows did not delay an instant | pellmell they rushed after him caught up with him swarmed against the brush and rock walls the blackfeet met them stanchly and gave way not an inch and the fighting was terrible | but over the barricade poured the crows | in a moment the whole interior was a dense mass of indians engaged hand to hand and every one yelling until as said the white men the noise fairly lifted the caps from our heads | guns and hatchets and clubs and knives rose and fell | the crow women were pressing to the outskirts to kill the wounded enemy | gradually the weight of the crows forced the blackfeet back | the blackfeet began to emerge over the upper end of the fort their faces still to the foe | presently all who might escape were outside but their enemies surrounded them at once | the blackfeet remaining were not many | they never faltered nor signed surrender | they only sang their death chants and forming in close order they moved along the ridge like one man cutting a way with their knives | by the half dozen they dropped even those who dropped fought until they were dead | soon the platoon was merely a squad the squad melted to a spot there was a swirl covering the spot and the spot had been washed out | not a blackfoot was left able to stand | the wounded who had lost their weapons hurled taunts as they lay helpless until the crows finished them also | truly had the blackfeet yelled: come and take us | but you will never take us alive | this night there was much mourning in the crow camp | thirty chiefs and braves had been killed twice that number wounded and many horses disabled | no prisoner had been brought in to pay by torture | the blackfeet nation would look upon the fight as their victory | so the crow dead were buried and into each grave of chief or brave were placed his weapons and the shaved off mane and tail of his best horse for every hair would become a horse for him in the spirit world | in their war days they ranged from the platte river of western nebraska down into new mexico and texas | but their favorite hunting grounds lay south of the arkansas river of western kansas and southeastern colorado | it was a desert country of whity yellow sand and sharp bare hills with the rocky mountains distant in the west and the only green that of the trees and brush along the water courses | nevertheless it was a very good kind of country | it had plenty of buffalo | the timber and the streams supplied winter shelter | the wagon road of the white merchants between the missouri river and santa fe of new mexico ran through the middle of it and furnished much plunder | in the south where lay comanche land and apache land there were mexican settlements that furnished horses | with the comanches and apaches and with the cheyennes and arapahos north the kiowas were friends | to the pawnees they were enemies and their name carried dread through many years of fighting | now in the summer of 1839 twenty kiowa warriors left their village near the arkansas river in present southern kansas to go down across comanche country and get horses and mules from the pasunke or the mexicans of el paso which is on the rio grande river border between northwestern texas and mexico | however in those days all that region was mexico | the head chief of the party was old do has an or bluff | but he did not command | gua da lon te or painted red was the war chief | dohasan would take command only in case gua da lon te was killed | among the warriors there were dagoi and kon a te whose name means black tripe | after several days' travel horseback clear across new mexico they came to el paso town where many goods were stored on the way between new mexico and old mexico and where the people got rich by trading and by making wine from grapes | but they could see soldiers guarding el paso so they did not dare to charge in and gather horses and mules from the frightened pasunke | dohasan who was wise as well as brave advised against it |  another time he said |  we are too few and we are a long way from home | let us go and come again | maybe on the way tip we will meet with luck among the other villages | they rested only the one night and turned back thinking that they had not been discovered | at the end of a day's journey through a bad waterless land they halted and camped by a spring of which they knew | it was a big rock sink or round deep basin with a pool of water at the bottom and a cave that extended under a shelf | the mexican soldiers must have struck their trail or perhaps had followed them from el paso for early in the morning there was a sudden shooting from all around and much yelling | bullets whined and spatted and horses screamed and fell over |  into the cave | shouted painted red | quick  hustled by old bluff and painted red into the cave they bolted | nobody had been hurt and the soldiers were afraid to venture in after them but right speedily they found themselves badly off | the soldiers camped along the edge of the well above so as to kill them by thirst and hunger | only in the darkness might the kiowas two or three at a time crawl out of the cave gulp a few swallows from the pool maybe slash a strip of horse meat and scuttle in again | while doing this dagoi was shot in the leg so that he could not walk | in a couple of days the dead horses began to decay for the sun was very hot | the smell grew sickening | the flesh was sickening | one or two of the dead horses lay in the pool and the water got sickening | the mexican soldiers stayed close and watchful and yelled insults in spanish | but they had with them several apache scouts and one of the apaches called in comanche so that the soldiers would not understand |  be of good cheer brothers he called |  be strong and hold out until these dogs of mexicans tire | the kiowas had no thought of surrendering | they would rather die where they were because if they surrendered they would be killed anyway | old dohasan and others among them belonged to the society of ka itse nko or real dogs whose members were under a vow never to surrender | part of them guarded the cave's mouth and the rest explored back inside | at the very end there was a hole which let in daylight | konate was boosted up but when he stuck his head through a soldier saw it and he had to duck down | thereupon the soldiers stopped the hole with a large rock | when ten days and nine nights had passed they all decided that they would either escape or be killed | the horse meat could not be touched neither could the water | it was better to die in the open like men than to die in a hole like gophers | the soldiers guarded the only trail that led up the side of the cliff wall out of the well but at another side there was a cedar which had rooted in a crack and almost reached the rim | by hard climbing a man might manage to scramble up and gain the open | but what to do with dagoi who had only one leg and was weak from pain |  you will not leave me my brothers | implored dagoi |  it is true i am wounded but if you leave me i shall surely die | perhaps you can carry me on your backs | or wait a day or two and the soldiers will grow tired |  no said old dohasan |  that is impossible | we must move fast and to get you up the tree would make noise | if we wait or if we stay we will all die and it is better that one should die than that all should die | have a strong heart my son | you are a warrior and you must die like a warrior | dagoi bowed his head |  those are good words he answered |  i hear them and they make me strong | i am a man and i am not afraid | when you get home tell my friends to come and avenge me | in the darkness dagoi dragged himself to the pool and sat beside it waiting for daylight and the bullets of the soldiers | old dohasan sang the death chant of the real dogs | then he stepped silently out leading the file of warriors to the wall under the tree that he might be the first to climb and meet the soldiers in case they were on watch | up he went into the cedar and on up went all one after another as fast as they could | the camp fires of the mexican soldiers were glowing right and left and behind and before along the rim but without a sound the nineteen gaunt kiowas bending low stole swiftly forward at the heels of dohasan | they succeeded | but in finding horses somebody made a little noise and the mexicans fired wildly into the darkness | however answering not and leading the horses out a short way step by step they were ready to vault on |  anybody hurt |  a bullet has gone through my body said konate |  but i will try to ride |  we must hurry spoke painted red | the camp was all aroused |  someone help konate | away they dashed several riding double and konate supported in his seat by a comrade | behind in the well dagoi sat beside the pool and kept his heart strong for the end that would come by daylight | all that night and all the next day they rode making northeast toward the desolate desert region of the staked plain on the homeward way across western texas | no mexican soldiers would follow into the staked plain | when after hard riding they arrived at sun mountain spring on the top of a high bare rock hill near the staked plain konate's wound had spoiled in him and he could not sit upright on his horse | he was very ill |  i am about to die friends he gasped |  do not try to carry me farther | but go yourselves and some day come back for my bones | he spoke sense | any one might see that he had only a few hours to live and that soon his comrades would be carrying only a body across the staked plain where the sun beat hotly and water was far apart | it was better that they leave him here at the spring where they might find his bones | so on the water's edge they built a shade for konate with a few crooked cedar branches and bidding him goodby they rode on into the great staked plain | they expected that they would never seen him again | what happened now to konate he often told and he told it always the same therefore it must be true | for the rest of the long day he lay there with the sun beating down around him and his mind and body very sick from his wound | he was unable to sleep | the sun set and the air changed to cool the twilight deepened to dusk alone on his hilltop he closed his eyes and waited for the spirit of the tai me or sun dance medicine to bear him to his fathers | in the star light he heard a wolf howl far off | he listened and the howl sounded again nearer from another direction | then he knew that the wolf had scented him and was ranging to find his spot | that would be bad to be eaten by a wolf and have one's bones scattered | konate groaned | his heart had been strong until this moment | he had hoped that his bones would be cared for | soon he heard the wolf at hand there was the soft patter of its pads and the sniffing of its inquiring nose seeking him out | and now he saw the wolf with shining eyes peering into the bough shelter where he lay helpless unable even to speak | that was an agonizing moment for konate | but lo instead of jumping upon him the wolf trotted forward and gently licked his wounds and then lay quietly down beside him | konate was amazed and thankful | while the wolf lay there next he heard another sound in the distance: the shrill eagle bone whistle music of the great sun dance of the kiowa nation | the music drew nearer and he heard the sun dance song and while he listened strong of heart again he saw the medicine spirit of the sun dance standing before him at the entrance to the shelter |  i pity you and shall not let you die said the medicine spirit |  you shall see your home and friends | then the medicine spirit brought down a rain to wash konate's wounds and cool his fever | the medicine spirit sat with konate most of the night and told him many things: told him how to make a new kind of sun dance shield and also an a po te or sacred forked staff that should be a medicine staff and have magic powers | toward morning the medicine spirit left saying: help is near | every bit of this konate firmly insisted was true although white men claimed that he dreamed | for listen: meanwhile the painted red party were riding on and in the staked plain they met six comanches bound to mexico after plunder | they spoke to the comanches regarding konate and asked them to cover his body so that the wolves should not get it | this the comanches promised to do and continued to the sun mountain spring where konate had been left to die | but when they reached the spring they found konate alive and stronger than when his comrades had bid him goodby | that astonished them | they then knew that he was medicine | therefore they washed him and gave him food and putting him on an extra horse they turned back and took him home | the village and all the tribe also were astonished to see him again | as proof that he had been visited by the medicine spirit he made the medicine shield of a new design and the apote or sacred forked stick | he took the name pa ta dal or lean bull | after that the keepers of the medicine stick bore the same name | konate carried the medicine stick in the sun dance for several years and then handed it on to his nephew k'a ya nti or falls over a bank who became lean bull the second but the white people called him poor buffalo | this apote was a two pronged stick about four feet long decorated with wild sage | it was smooth and had no bark and was brought out only once a year for the sun dance | the keeper of it used it for beating time in the dance | at the close of the dance it was stuck forks up in the ground in the center of the medicine lodge and left until the next year | when the stick was eighteen years old konate's nephew planted it as before at the close of the sun dance in the center of the medicine lodge on the plain and when the kiowas returned the next summer for another sun dance they discovered that the apote had been planted the other end up and was putting forth green leaves | for a stick eighteen years old without bark to do this was certainly great medicine | no one now might doubt the story of konate to whom the taime spirit had talked under the bough shelter by the sun mountain spring | none of the kiowas dared to touch the apote this time or to stay near the medicine lodge | the dance was held at another place | when ten years later or in october 1867 the kiowas met in a treaty council with the united states near the present town of medicine lodge on medicine lodge creek southern kansas they were enabled to show that the apote had grown to be a large tree | such had been the strong medicine of konate to whom about to die from his wounds in his shelter by the sun mountain spring beyond the staked plain the taime spirit had talked | konate was dead but k'a ya nti his nephew the other keeper of the stick was still alive and he knew | the indians who bore this name were the powerful dakotas the true sioux of history | the wide nation of the lakota as these sioux called themselves was a league of seven council fires | the four divisions of the santees lived in minnesota the two divisions of the yanktons lived between them and the missouri river the one large division of the tetons lived in their dakota country west of the missouri river | the santees the yanktons and the tetons spoke their own dialects | they differed in appearance from one another | they were separated into tribes and bands | even as late as 1904 they numbered twenty five thousand people in the united states | by mind muscle and morals they have been rated as leaders of the western red men | they roamed hither thither and depended upon the buffalo for food | they waged stout war | the tetons were the strongest and formed half of the dakota nation | it was chiefly they who fought the united states soldiers for so long | the war opened in 1855 over the killing of a crippled cow by a min i con jou at fort laramie of wyoming on the oregon trail of the emigrants | the brul s or burnt thighs the og la las or scatter one's own the hunk pa pas or those who camp by themselves the min i con jous or those who plant beside the stream the si ha sa pas or black moccasins: these were the teton sioux who battled the hardest to save their buffalo and their lands from the white man | red cloud at first was chief of the bad faces band of oglala sioux | they were a small fighting band but he was a noted brave | his count showed more coups or strike the enemy feats than the count of any other warrior of the oglalas | before he retired from war his coups numbered eighty | he was born in 1822 | his sioux name was makh pia sha meaning red cloud | in the beginning it probably referred to a cloud at sunrise or sunset later it referred to his army of warriors whose red blankets covered the hills | when he was forty years old there was much excitement among the white men to the west of the sioux range | from the mines of idaho the gold seekers had crossed to the eastern base of the rocky mountains in western montana | mining camps such as helena bozeman and virginia city sprang up | the oregon trail of the emigrants already passed through the sioux country and the sioux had agreed to let it alone | now the united states asked permission to make a new road which from fort laramie of southern wyoming would leave the oregon trail and branch off northwest through the powder river and the big horn country of wyoming and on west across montana as a short cut to the gold fields | this part of wyoming really was crow indian country but the sioux had driven the crows out and with the northern cheyennes were using the region for a hunting ground | the white man's trails to the south had frightened the buffalo and reduced the herds the powder river valleys were the only ranges left to the sioux where they might hunt and always find plenty of meat | some of the sioux chiefs did sign a treaty for the new road | the only oglalas who signed were subchiefs | red cloud did not sign | the united states went ahead anyway | troops were sent forward to begin the work of building the road | red cloud with his oglalas and some cheyennes surrounded them and captured them held them prisoners for two weeks until his young men threatened to kill them | then he released them with a warning |  i shall stand in the trail he said | those were the words of pontiac to major rogers one hundred years before | united states officials were ordered to fort laramie to talk with the angry red cloud | he declined to meet them | but already a number of white gold seekers had entered by this bozeman trail as it was known | in june of the next year 1866 the united states tried again to get red cloud's name on the paper | a council was called at fort laramie | during the last year another fort had been located | it was fort reno the first out post of the new trail at the powder river one hundred and sixty seven miles along from laramie | red cloud and his lieutenant they fear even his horses came in to talk with the united states at fort laramie | a great throng of indians was present for fort laramie was a busy post | nothing could be done with the red cloud band | the united states was willing to promise that nobody should be allowed to leave the new road or to disturb any game | red cloud only shook his head | he well knew that the white travelers would not obey the law | they would hunt and camp as they chose |  wah nee chee | he said |  no good | why do you come here and ask for what you have already taken | a fort has been built and the road is being used | i say again we will not sell our hunting grounds for a road | but the united states had decided | the government had been assured by the treaty makers that all the sioux would finally yield | there was last fall's treaty as a starter | the sioux from every band had signed | besides the government could not give up the right to open roads | a railroad had the power to take right of way through towns and lands and a government wagon road should have the same license | so certain was the government that the road would be opened that even while the council with the red cloud oglalas was in session there arrived at fort laramie colonel henry b carrington of the eighteenth infantry with seven hundred soldiers | red cloud saw the camp |  where are those soldiers going |  they are sent to open the new road and build forts |  the americans seek to steal our land whether we say yes or no | angrily uttered red cloud |  they will have to fight | he and they fear even his horses whom the white men called young man afraid of his horses seized their rifles and rode away and three hundred of their warriors followed them |  red cloud means war warned the indians who remained |  the great father makes us presents to buy the road but the white soldiers come to steal it first | in two moons the white war chief will not have a hoof left | an express sent after red cloud to ask him to return was whipped with bows and ordered to get out and tell the white chiefs that red cloud would not talk about the road | colonel carrington marched on into the forbidden land | the officers' wives were with them | traders along the line insisted that the indians were determined to fight but some of the emigrant outfits bound over the trail to the mines were scornful of danger | one emigrant captain laughed when the women were timid |  you'll never see an injun unless he comes in to beg for sugar and tobacco he said |  i've been on the plains too long to be scared by such trash | this was at fort reno | that very morning in broad daylight red cloud's band ran off all the post sutler's horses and mules while the soldiers looked on | eighty men pursued and captured only one indian pony loaded with goods obtained at fort laramie | colonel carrington left a detachment here at the powder river to build a better fort reno | he marched on | meanwhile red cloud had been growing stronger | sioux warriors were hastening to join him | spotted tail of the brul s had declined to accept the treaty for opening the road he waited for red cloud but he was wisely staying at home | however his brul young men were riding away in large numbers and he told the white people at fort laramie that if they went far on the trail they had better go prepared to look out for their hair | red cloud was watching the march of the soldiers | he did not attack but when he saw them pushing on and finally making camp to locate another fort fifty miles northwest of reno on piney fork of lodge pole creek in the big horn mountains of northern wyoming he again sent a message by a party of soldiers whom he met and turned back |  the white chief must take his soldiers out of this country | let him decide for peace or war | if he wants peace he can go back to powder river | the fort there can stay | but no forts shall be built farther on the road and no soldiers shall march over the road which has never been given to the white people | red cloud wanted an answer at once | he also asked that the white chief come to him with an interpreter and settle matters in a council | but the messenger was held at the fort for a short time and red cloud moved his warriors to a new place | colonel carrington invited the sioux to come to the camp and went ahead building his fort | some bands of northern cheyennes appeared for a talk | they said that red cloud had urged them to join the sioux in keeping the white men out of the hunting grounds and that he knew what the soldiers had been doing every hour since they left fort laramie | the cheyennes seemed a little fearful of the sioux but said that if they were given provisions they would stay away from the white trail | when the cheyennes returned to the sioux red cloud asked them what the white chief had said |  is he going back to the powder river |  no answered black horse of the cheyennes |  the white chief will not go back and his soldiers will go on |  what presents did he give you |  all we wanted to eat | he wishes the sioux and the cheyennes and all the other indians to go to fort laramie and sign the treaty and get more presents | i think that we had better take the white man's hand and presents rather than fight him and lose everything | no  replied red cloud |  the white man lies and steals | my lodges were many now they are few | the white man wants all | he must fight and the indian will die where his fathers died | with that the sioux unstrung their bows and whipped the cheyennes on the face and back crying coup | as if they were striking the enemy | so black horse sent word that the sioux intended war | the fort was named fort phil kearney | it was built of timber cut in the pine woods seven miles distant and was surrounded by a palisade or high fence of thick pickets set upright | saw mills were placed in the woods and the wood camps were protected by block houses | almost one hundred wagons were used to haul the logs and boards | one hundred miles onward another fort was started: fort c f smith | the crows informed colonel carrington that red cloud had tried to enlist even them that all the sioux were uniting to drive out the white men from this region and that in the fall there would be a big fight at the two forts | white mouth and rotten tail said that they were half a day in riding through the sioux village there were fifteen hundred lodges | in truth chief red cloud had over two thousand warriors with whom to stand in the path | and there he stood | nobody might doubt that | his raiders watched every mile of the trail back to powder river and not an emigrant train got through | he himself with two thousand warriors guarded fort kearney where the white chief lived | nobody might venture from it to hunt game | the wood wagons might move only when many together and well armed | not a load of hay could be brought in without strong escort | after a time no mail could be sent on to fort smith | colonel carrington had five companies of infantry and one company of the second cavalry | the infantry was mostly recruits | their guns were old style muzzle loaders but the band had the new spencer breech loaders | he asked for better guns and more ammunition | the government was not certain that the sioux could do much against soldiers of a country which had just been trained by a four years' war and carrington was left to prove it | chief red cloud had his first chance to prove the opposite on december 6 | he had been amusing his warriors by letting them gallop past the fort and shout challenges to the soldiers to come out and fight then when the cannon shot at them they dodged the shells but did not always succeed | the big guns that shot twice surprised them | on the morning of december 6 red cloud struck in earnest and had planned to strike hard | he had a line of signal flags seven miles long by which to direct his army | then he sent a company to attack a wood train | the attack on the wood train brought the troops out of the fort | one detachment of thirty five cavalry and a few mounted infantry was commanded by captain william j fetterman | he was very anxious to fight indians in fact the officers all had set their hearts upon taking red cloud's scalp | captain fetterman rescued the wagon train by chasing the sioux away but in about five miles red cloud faced his men about and closed | it was an ambuscade | the troopers of the cavalry were stampeded and the captain found himself with two other officers and a dozen men surrounded by yelling warriors | colonel carrington arrived just in time to save him but young lieutenant h s bingham of the second cavalry was killed and so was sergeant bowers | when captain fetterman had returned to the fort he had changed his mind regarding the prowess of the sioux whom he had thought to be only robbers |  i have learned a lesson he remarked |  this indian war has become a hand to hand fight and requires great caution | i'll take no more risks like that of today | red cloud was not satisfied | his warriors had not done exactly as he had told them to do | he bided his time | on the morning of december 21 he was again ready | his men were stationed waiting for a wood train to appear | it appeared starting out to chop timber in the pine woods and haul the logs to the fort | it was an unusually strong train a number of heavy wagons and ninety armed men | red cloud let it get about four miles along and ordered it attacked | he had spies upon a ridge of hills to watch the fort | when the attack was heard at the fort soldiers dashed out | the red cloud warriors allowed the wagon train to think that it had whipped them | he withdrew across the ridge | the leader of the soldiers was captain fetterman again | he had asked for the command | with him was captain fred h brown who expected to go back to fort laramie and wished first to get a scalp | he and captain fetterman were rivals for scalps and had almost forgotten the affair of december 6 | they were gallant soldiers but reckless | altogether the detachment numbered seventy nine officers and men and two scouts named wheatley and fisher | captain fetterman was distinctly ordered by colonel carrington to do nothing but rescue the wagon train | he must not cross the ridge in pursuit of the sioux | captain fetterman did not move directly for the place of the wagon train | he made a circuit to cut off the attacking sioux at their rear or between the wagon train and the ridge to the north of it | he had taken no surgeon so dr hines was hurried after him | the doctor came back in another hurry | he reported that the wagon train was on its way to the timber without the captain and that the captain had disappeared over the ridge | many indians were in sight and the doctor had been obliged to stop short | now on a sudden there was a burst of distant gun fire | in twelve minutes a second detachment of soldiers was on the run from the fort for the battle wagons and ambulances and more men followed and soon only one hundred and nineteen men remained | the firing was very heavy in volleys then in fire at will then it died down quit | not a sound could be heard as the women and men in fort kearney strained their ears and eyes | presently a courier from the second detachment galloped headlong in | he said that the valley beyond the ridge was swarming with sioux they yelled and dared the soldiers to come down to the road there | but of the captain fetterman command no trace could be sighted | the soldiers and the reinforcements stayed out all the afternoon | they returned at dark but of the eighty one others none came back | all of them the entire eighty one had fallen to the army of red cloud | nobody was alive to tell the story of the fight | the signs on the field were plain though and of course the red cloud warriors knew well what had occurred | captain fetterman had crossed the ridge to chase the sioux | two thousand red cloud men were waiting for him | they permitted him to advance to the forbidden road | the white soldiers fought until their ammunition was almost spent | then the red cloud men rushed | only six of the white soldiers were shot the rest were killed by hand | the plan of red cloud and his chiefs had been laid to get all the troops out of the fort together kill them and seize the fort | but the warriors had not waited long enough | their victory was too quick and they lost too many men themselves in the one fight: seventy of killed and wounded they said sixty five of killed alone said the red blotches on the field | still red cloud had closed the road with the bodies of the soldiers | he had made his word good | the garrison in fort kearney gave up all thought of glory by capturing red cloud and this winter there was no more fighting | how many warriors red cloud had to cover the hills with their scarlet blankets nobody knew but the count ran from three thousand to five thousand | the spring came and the summer came and the road had not been opened | in more than a year not a single wagon had passed upon it through the hunting grounds of the sioux | another white chief had been sent to take command of fort phil kearney | he was brigadier general h w wessels | all this summer the soldiers were having to fight for wood and water | the contractor in charge of the teams hauling lumber complained that he must have more protection or he would be unable to do the work | captain james powell of the twenty seventh infantry was ordered out to protect the lumber camps | he took lieutenant john c jenness and fifty one men | the wood choppers had two camps about a mile apart | the captain detailed twenty five of his men to guard the one camp and escort the wagon trains to the fort with the twenty six others he made a fort of wagon boxes at the second camp | he arranged fourteen of the wagon boxes on the ground in a circle | some of the boxes had been lined with boiler iron | 'twouldn't take him long to comb the kinks out of you |  i don't think you have left any granny said the harvester |  i see what you mean and in all probability you are right but i can't send for the girl |  name o' goodness why | he had plenty of ammunition and plenty of new breech loading rifles | the little fort was located in an open basin surrounded by gentle hills | he directed the men of the other camp to come in at the first sign of trouble | the sioux were at hand | red cloud had been merely waiting for the soldiers to march out and make it worth his while to descend | he was resolved to destroy fort kearney this year before the snows | it seemed to him that again he had the soldiers where he wanted them | word of the flimsy little corral spread a laugh among his two thousand warriors | the squaws and old men were summoned from the allied sioux and out law cheyenne village to come and see and be ready with their knives | on the morning of august 2 he so suddenly attacked the unfortified wood camp that he cut it off completely | two hundred of his men captured the mule herd five hundred of them attacked the wagon train there burned the wagons and drove the soldiers and teamsters and choppers who were outside the corral in flight to fort kearney | scalps were taken | now it was the turn of the puny corral and the rest of the soldiers | he could see only the low circle of wagon boxes |they were covered with blankets underneath the blankets there were soldiers few and frightened |
