originally written for me in 1857 and published in titan for july of that year has not appeared in any collective edition of the author's works british or american | it was his closing contribution to a series of three articles concerning chinese affairs prepared when our troubles with that empire seemed to render war imminent | the first two were given in titan for february and april 1857 and then issued with additions in the form of a pamphlet which is now very scarce | it consisted of 152 pages thus arranged: 1 preliminary note i iv 2 preface pp | 3 68 3 china the two titan papers pp | 69 149 4 postscript pp | 149 152 | in the posthumous supplementary volume xvi | of the collected works the third section was reprinted but all the other matter was discarded with a rather imperfect appreciation of the labour which the author had bestowed upon it and his own estimate of the value of what he had condensed in this series as frequently expressed to me during its progress | in the twelfth volume of the 'riverside' edition of de quincey's works published by houghton mifflin co boston u s a the whole of the 152 pp | of the expanded china reprint are given but not the final section here reproduced from titan | the chinese questions stirred de quincey profoundly and roused all the 'john bullism' of his nature | two passages from the 'preliminary note' will show his object in throwing so much energy into this subject: national morality | 'its purpose 1 is to diffuse amongst those of the middle classes whose daily occupations leave them small leisure for direct personal inquiries some sufficient materials for appreciating the justice of our british pretensions and attitude in our coming war with china | it is a question frequently raised amongst public journalists whether we british are entitled to that exalted distinction which sometimes we claim for ourselves and which sometimes is claimed on our behalf by neutral observers on the national practice of morality | thus in the valleys of the rhone the rhine and its tributaries and ticino as in the banks lakes in the central region particularly those of geneva neuch tel district in zurich and constance the vines are the mainstay of agriculture | a 200 or 300 meters above in hilly plains and valleys the fields are covered with vegetables cereals grains and vegetables of all kinds and fruit trees in great abundance such as apple pear apricot and plum | you climb a little more and beech forests appear or varieties oak hazel bushes endless wild and many other fruit trees resistant as the cherry | legumes are scarce or missing the corn do not thrive replaced for hay everything changes in appearance | another overlapping area live only conifers ie pine and spruce incredible variety of species and weeds rough | above away those dark halls of the high mountains leaving the field almost exclusively to dwarf grass extending towards the tops of huge and thick skirts carpets | above is the region of dwarf ferns lichens and mosses pale ink or dark | finally all vegetation is gone life ends smiling all forms coagulate water or filtered to get lost in the depths underground and are not but granite deserts and icy seas where you only feel the shrill cry of the eagle or the terrifying roar of the storm at those heights the sun itself often lost splendor the loneliness of an eternal winter reigns over unfathomable depths which keep concavities in the wondrous mystery of the physiology of the globe | this wide range of temperatures and simultaneous production of swiss flora has given birth naturally many orders of industries and customs staggered from the bottom of the valleys to the highest eminences habitable | thus towards the margins of lakes and rivers is the active traveler cities manufacturers manufacturing and trade such as geneva lausanne and vevey neuch tel lucerne district in zurich basel and schaffhausen and numerous farmers vineyards and boatmen | in the region located immediately above the fine arts works hand sensitive such as watch making wood carving ceramics hats straw lace and embroidery in la chaux de fonds bern fribourg st gall appenzell etc | through the area above the picturesque villas dairies pastures covered cattle life and gentle manners pastor |  the position and outcome of matters in those critical years may be recalled by a few lines from the annual summaries of the times on the new years' days of 1858 and 1859 | these indicate that de quincey was here a pretty fair exponent of the growing wrath of the english people |  january 1 1858 | 'the presence of the china force on the indian seas was especially fortunate | the demand for reinforcements at calcutta caused by the indian mutiny was obviously more urgent than the necessity for punishing the insolence at canton | at a more convenient season the necessary operations in china will be resumed and in the meantime the blockading squadron has kept the offending population from despising the resentment of england | the interval which has elapsed has served to remove all reasonable doubt of the necessity of enforcing redress | public opinion has not during the last twelvemonth become more tolerant of barbarian outrages | there is no reason to believe that the punishment of the provincial authorities will involve the cessation of intercourse with the remainder of the chinese empire '|  january 1 1859 | 'the working of our treaties with china and japan will be watched with curiosity both in and out of doors and we can only hope that nothing will be done to blunt the edge of that masterly decision by which these two giants of eastern tale have been felled to the earth and reduced to the level and bearing of common humanity '|  the titles which follow are those which were given by de quincey himself to the three sections h | hints towards an appreciation of the coming war in china | said before the opening of july that same warning remark may happen to have a prophetic rank and practically a prophetic value which two months later would tell for mere history and history paid for by a painful experience | the war which is now approaching wears in some respects the strangest features that have yet been heard of in old romance or in prosaic history for we are at war with the southernmost province of china namely quantung and pre eminently with its chief city of canton but not with the other four commercial ports of china nor in fact at present with china in general and again we are at war with yeh the poisoning governor of canton but which is strangest of all not with yeh's master the tartar emperor locked up in a far distant peking | another strange feature in this war is the footing upon which our alliances stand | for allies it seems we are to have nominal as regards the costs of war but real and virtual as regards its profits | the french the americans 3 and i believe the belgians have pushed forward absolutely in post haste advance of ourselves their several diplomatic representatives who are instructed duly to lodge their claims for equal shares of the benefits reaped by our british fighting but with no power to contribute a single file towards the bloodshed of this war nor a single guinea towards its money costs | napoleon i in a craze of childish spite towards this country pleased himself with denying the modern heraldic bearings of great britain and resuscitating the obsolete shield of our plantagenets he insisted that our true armorial ensigns were the leopards | but really the third napoleon is putting life and significance into his uncle's hint and using us as in hindostan they use the cheeta or hunting leopard for rousing and running down his oriental game | it is true that in certain desperate circumstances when no opening remains for pacific negotiation these french and american agents are empowered to send home for military succours | a worshipful prospect when we throw back our eyes upon our own share in these warlike preparations with all the advantages of an unparalleled marine | six months have slipped away since lord clarendon our foreign secretary received in downing street sir j bowring's and admiral seymour's reports of yeh's atrocities | six calendar months not less but more by some days have run past us since then and though some considerable part of our large reinforcements must have reached their ground in april and even the commander in chief sir john ashburnham by the middle of may yet i believe that many of the gun boats on which mainly will rest the pursuit of yeh's junks if any remain unabsconded northwards have actually not yet left our own shores | the war should naturally have run its course in one campaign | assuredly it will if confined within the limits of yeh's command even supposing that command to comprehend the two quangs | practically then it is a fantastic impossibility that any reversionary service to our british expedition which is held out in prophetic vision as consecrating our french and american friends from all taint of mercenary selfishness ever can be realised | i am not going to pursue this subject | but a brief application of it to a question at this moment june 16 urgently appealing to public favour is natural and fair | canvassers are now everywhere moving on behalf of a ship canal across the isthmus of suez | this canal proposes to call upon the subscribers for 9 000 000 sterling the general belief is that first and last it will call for 12 000 000 to 15 000 000 | but at that price or at any price it is cheap and ultimate failure is impossible | why do i mention it | everywhere there is a rumour that 'a narrow jealousy' in london is the bar which obstructs this canal speculation | there is indeed and already before the canal proposal there was a plan in motion for a railway across the isthmus which seems far enough from meeting the vast and growing necessities of the case | but be that as it may with what right does any man in europe or america impute narrowness of spirit local jealousy or selfishness to england when he calls to mind what sacrifices she is at this moment making for those very oriental interests which give to the ship canal its sole value the men the ships the money spent or to be spent upon the canton war and then in fairness connects that expense or the similar expense made by her in 1840 42 with the operative use to which in those years she applied all the diplomatic concessions extorted by her arms | the first word a memorable word which she uttered on proposing her terms in 1842 was what i demand for myself that let all christendom enjoy | and since that era i e for upwards of fourteen years all christendom that did not fail in the requisite energy for improving the opportunities then first laid open has enjoyed the very same advantages in chinese ports as great britain secondly without having contributed anything whatever to the winning or the securing of these advantages thirdly on the pure volunteer intercession made by britain on their behalf | the world has seen enough of violence and cruelties the most bloody in the service of commercial jealousies and nowhere more than in these oriental regions: witness the abominable acts of the dutch at amboyna in japan and in java c witness the bigoted oppressions where and when soever they had power of the colonising portuguese and spaniards | tyranny and merciless severities for the ruin of commercial rivals have been no rarities for the last three and a half centuries in any region of the east | but first of all from great britain in 1842 was heard the free spontaneous proclamation this was a rarity unlimited access with advantages the very same as her own to a commerce which it was always imagined that she laboured to hedge round with repulsions making it sacred to her own privileged use | a royal gift was this but a gift which has not been received by christendom in a corresponding spirit of liberal appreciation | one proof of that may be read in the invidious statement supported by no facts or names which i have just cited | were this even true a london merchant is not therefore a londoner or even a briton | germans swiss frenchmen c are settled there as merchants in crowds | no nation however is compromised by any act of her citizens acting as separate and uncountenanced individuals | so that even if better established as a fact this idle story would still be a calumny and as a calumny it would merit little notice | nevertheless i have felt it prudent to give it a prominent station as fitted peculiarly by the dark shadows of its malice pointed at our whole nation collectively to call into more vivid relief the unexampled lustre of that royal munificence in england which by one article of a treaty dictated at the point of her bayonets threw open in an hour to all nations that chinese commerce never previously unsealed through countless generations of man |  3 'america:' for america in particular there is an american defence offered in a washington paper the weekly union for may 28 1857 which for cool ignoring of facts exceeds anything that i remember | it begins thus: 'since our treaty with china in 1844' and that be it remembered was possible only in consequence of our war and its close in 1842 'the most amicable relations have existed between the united states and china china is our friend and we are hers '|indeed  as a brief commentary upon that statement i recommend to the reader's attention our blue books on china of last winter | the american commander certainly wound up his quarrel with yeh in a mysterious way that drew some sneers from the various nationalities then moving in that neighbourhood but no less certainly he had during the october of 1856 a smart exchange of cannon shots with yeh which lasted for some days three at least according to my remembrance and ended in the capture of numerous chinese forts | the american apologist says in effect that the united states will not fight because they have no quarrel | but that is not the sole question | does the united states mean to take none of the benefits that may be won by our arms | he speaks of the french as more belligerently inclined than the united states | would that this were really so | no good will come of schisms between the nations of christendom | there is a posthumous work of commissioner lin in twelve quartos printed at peking urgently pressing the necessity for china of building upon such schisms the one sole policy that can save her from ruin | next then having endeavoured to place these preliminary points in their true light i will anticipate the course by which the campaign would naturally be likely to travel supposing no alien and mischievous disturbance at work for deranging it | simply to want fighting allies would be no very menacing evil | we managed to do without them in our pretty extensive plan of warfare fifteen years ago and there is no reason why we should find our difficulties now more intractable than then | i should imagine that the american congress and the french executive would look on uneasily and with a sense of shame at the prospect of sharing largely in commercial benefits which they had not earned whilst the burdens of the day were falling exclusively upon the troops of our nation but that is a consideration for their own feelings and may happen to corrode their hearts and their sense of honour most profoundly at some future time when it may have ceased to be remediable | if that were all for us there would be no arrears of mortified sensibilities to apprehend | but what is ominous even in relation to ourselves from these professedly inert associates these sleeping partners in our chinese dealings is that their presence with no active functions argues a faith lurking somewhere in the possibility of talking the chinese into reason | such a chimera still surviving the multiform experience we have had augurs ruin to the total enterprise | it is not absolutely impossible that even yeh or any imbecile governor armed with the same obstinacy and brutal arrogance might under the terrors of an armament such as he will have to face simulate a submission that was far from his thoughts | we ourselves found in the year 1846 when in fidelity to our engagements we gave back the important island of chusan which we had retained for four years in fact until all the instalments of the ransom money had been paid that a more negligent ear was turned to our complaints and remonstrances | the vile mob of canton long kept and indulged as so many trained bull dogs for the purpose of venting that insolence to europeans which the mandarins could no longer utter personally without coming into collision with the treaty became gradually unmanageable even by their masters | in 1847 lord palmerston then foreign secretary was reduced to the necessity of fulminating this passage against the executive government of the murdering city 'you' lord palmerston was addressing sir john davis at that time h m plenipotentiary in china 'will inform the chinese authorities in plain and distinct terms that the british government will not tolerate that a chinese mob shall with impunity maltreat british subjects in china whenever they get them into their power and that if the chinese authorities will not punish and prevent such outrages the british government will be obliged to take the matter into their own hands and it will not be their fault if in such case the innocent are involved in the punishment sought to be inflicted on the guilty '| this commanding tone was worthy of lord palmerston and in harmony with his public acts in all cases where he has understood the ground which he occupied | unhappily he did not understand the case of canton | the british were admitted by each successive treaty their right of entry was solemnly acknowledged by the emperor | satisfied with this lord palmerston said 'enough: the principle is secured the mere details locally intelligible no doubt i do not pretend to understand | but all this will come in time | in time you will be admitted into canton | and for the present rest satisfied with having your right admitted if not as yet your persons '| ay but unfortunately nothing short of plenary admission to british flesh and blood ever will satisfy the organised ruffians of canton that they have not achieved a triumph over the british which triumph as a point still open to doubt amongst mischief makers they seek to strengthen by savage renewal as often as they find a british subject unprotected by armed guardians within their streets | in those streets murder walks undisguised | and the only measure for grappling with it is summarily to introduce the british resident to prostrate all resistance and to punish it by the gallows 4 where it proceeds to acts of murder | it is sad consideration for those either in england or china who were nearly or indirectly connected with canton amongst whom must be counted the british government that beyond a doubt the murders of our countrymen which occurred in that city would have been intercepted by such a mastery over the local ruffians as could not be effected so long as the treaty of nanking was not carried into effect with respect to free entrance and residence of british subjects | as things stood all that sir j davis could do in obedience to the directions from the home government was to order a combined naval and military attack upon all the chinese forts which belt the approaches to canton | these were all captured and the immense number of eight hundred and twenty seven heavy guns were in a few hours made unserviceable either by knocking off their trunnions or by spiking them or in both ways | the imperial commissioner keying previously known so favourably to the english by his good sense and discretion had on this occasion thought it his best policy to ignore lord palmerston's letter: a copy had been communicated to him but he took not the least notice of it | if this were intended for insolence it was signally punished within a few hours | it happened that on our english list of grievances there remained a shocking outrage offered to colonel chesney a distinguished officer of the engineers 5 and which to a certainty would have terminated in his murder but for the coming up at the critical moment of a chinese in high authority | the villains concerned in this outrage were known were arrested and according to an agreement with our plenipotentiary were to be punished in our presence | but in contempt of all his engagements and out of pure sycophantic concession to the canton mob keying notified that we the injured party were to be excluded | in that case no punishment at all would have been inflicted | luckily our troops and our shipping had not yet dispersed | sir j davis therefore wrote to keying openly taxing him with his breach of honour | 'i was going' these were sir john's words 'to hong kong to morrow but since you behave with evasion and bad faith in not punishing the offenders in the presence of deputed officers i shall keep the troops at canton and proceed to morrow in the steamer to foshan where if i meet with insult i will burn the town '| foshan is a town in the neighbourhood of canton and happened to be the scene of colonel chesney's ill usage | now upon this vigorous step what followed | hear sir john: 'towards midnight a satisfactory reply was received and at five o'clock next morning three offenders were brought to the guard house a mandarin of high rank being present on the part of the chinese and deputed officers on the part of the british | the men were bambooed in succession by the chinese officers of justice ' and at the close of the scene the mandarin upon a requisition from our side explained to the mob who crowded about the barriers why the men were punished and warned them that similar chastisement for similar offences awaited themselves | in one point only the example made was unsatisfactory: the men punished were not identified as the same who had assaulted colonel chesney | they might be criminals awaiting punishment for some other offence | with so shuffling a government as the chinese always moving through darkness and on the principles of a crooked policy no perfect satisfaction must ever be looked for | but still what a bright contrast between this energy of men acquainted with the chinese character and the foolish imbecility of our own government in downing street who are always attempting the plan of soothing and propitiating by concession those ignoble orientals in whose eyes all concession great or small through the whole scale of graduation is interpreted as a distinct confession of weakness | thus did all our governments: thus above all others did the east india company for generations deal with the chinese and the first act of ours that ever won respect from china was anson's broadsides and the second was our refusal of the ko tou | thus did our indian government in the early stages of their intercourse deal with the burmese | thus did our government deal with the japanese an exaggerated copy of the chinese | what they wanted with japan was simply to do her a very kind and courteous service namely to return safe and sound to their native land seven japanese who had been driven by hurricanes in continued succession into the pacific and had ultimately been saved from death by british sailors | our wise government at home were well aware of the atrocious inhospitality practised systematically by these cruel islanders and what course did they take to propitiate them | good sense would have prescribed the course of arming the british vessel in so conspicuous a fashion as to inspire the wholesome respect of fear | instead of which our government actually drew the teeth of the particular vessel selected by carefully withdrawing each individual gun | the japanese cautiously sailed round her ascertained her powerless condition and instantly proceeded to force her away by every mode of insult nor were the unfortunate japanese ever restored to their country | now contrast with this endless tissue of imbecilities practised through many generations by our blind and obstinate government for such it really is in its modes of dealing with asiatics the instantaneous success of 'sharp practice' and resolute appeals to fear on the part of sir john davis | by midnight of the same day on which the british remonstrance had been lodged an answer is received and this answer in a perfect rapture of panic concedes everything demanded and by sunrise the next morning the whole affair has been finished | two centuries on our old east indian system of negotiating with china would not have arrived at the same point | later in the very same year occurred another and more atrocious explosion of canton ruffianism and the instantaneous retribution which followed to the leading criminals showed at once how great an advance had been made in winning respect for ourselves and in extorting our rights by this energetic mode of action | on sunday the 5th of december six british subjects had gone out into the country on a pleasure excursion some of whom unhappily carried pocket pistols | they were attacked by a mob of the usual canton character one chinese was killed and one wounded by pistol shots but of the six british encompassed by a countless crowd not one escaped: all six were murdered and then thrown into the river | immediately and before the british had time to take any steps the chinese authorities were all in motion | the resolute conduct of sir john davis had put an end to the chinese policy of shuffling by making it no longer hopeful | it lost much more than it gained | and accordingly it was agreed after a few days' debate that the emperor's pleasure should not be taken except upon the more doubtful cases | four about whose guilt no doubts existed were immediately beheaded and the others after communicating with peking were punished in varying degrees one or two capitally |  4 'by the gallows:' or much rather by decapitation | accordingly we read of a ming i e native chinese emperor who upon finding himself in a dreadfully small minority retired into his garden with his daughter and there hanged both himself and the lady | on no account would he have decapitated either since in that case the corpses being headless would in chinese estimation have been imperfect |  5 'colonel chesney:' the same i believe whose name was at one time so honourably known in connection with the euphrates and its steam navigation | conduct of the war | such is the condition of that guilty town nearest of all chinese towns to hong kong and indissolubly connected with ourselves | from this town it is that the insults to our flag and the attempts at poisoning wholesale and retail have collectively emanated and all under the original impulse of yeh | surely in speculating on the conduct of the war either as probable or as reasonable the old oracular sentence of cato the elder and of the roman senate delenda est carthago begins to murmur in our ears not in this stern form but in some modification better suited to a merciful religion and to our western civilization | it is a great neglect on the part of somebody that we have no account of the baker's trial at hong kong | he was acquitted it seems but upon what ground | some journals told us that he represented yeh as coercing him into this vile attempt through his natural affection for his family alleged to be in yeh's power at canton | such a fact if true would furnish some doubtful palliation of the baker's crime and might have weight allowed in the sentence but surely it would place a most dangerous power in the hands of chinese grandees if through the leverage of families within their grasp and by official connivance on our part they could reach and govern a set of agents in hong kong | no sympathy with our horror of secret murders by poison under the shelter of household opportunities must be counted on from the emperor for he has himself largely encouraged rewarded and decorated these claims on his public bounty | the more necessary that such nests of crime as canton and such suggestors of crime as yeh should be thoroughly disarmed | this could be done as regards the city by three changes: first by utterly destroying the walls and gates secondly by admitting the british to the freest access and placing their residence in a special quarter upon the securest footing thirdly and as one chief means in that direction by establishing a police on an english plan and to some extent english in its composition | as to the cost it is evident enough that the colonial head quarters at hong kong must in future keep up a permanent military establishment and since any danger threatening this colony must be kindled and fed chiefly in canton why not make this large city sole focus as it is of all mischief to us and not a hundred miles distant from the little island the main barrack of the armed force | upon this world's tariff of international connections what is china in relation to great britain | free is she or not free to dissolve her connection with us | secondly what is great britain when commercially appraised in relation to china | is she of great value or slight value to china | first then concerning china viewed in its connection with ourselves this vast but perhaps not proportionably populous country offers by accident the same unique advantage for meeting a social hiatus in our british system that is offered by certain southern regions in the american united states for meeting another hiatus within the same british system | without tea without cotton great britain no longer great would collapse into a very anomalous sort of second rate power | without cotton the main bulwark of our export commerce would depart | and without tea our daily life would generally speaking be as effectually ruined as bees without a flora | in both of these cases it happens that the benefit which we receive is unique that is not merely ranking foremost upon a scale of similar benefits reaped from other lands a largest contribution where others might still be large but standing alone and in a solitude that we have always reason to regard as alarming | so that if georgia c withdrew from liverpool and manchester her myriads of cotton bales palsied would be our commercial supremacy and if childish china should refuse her tea for as to her silk that is of secondary importance we must all go supperless to bed: seriously speaking the social life of england would receive a deadly wound | it is certainly a phenomenon without a parallel in the history of social man that a great nation numbering twenty five millions after making an allowance on account of those amongst the very poorest of the irish who do not use tea should within one hundred years have found themselves able so absolutely to revolutionise their diet as to substitute for the gross stimulation of ale and wine the most refined elegant and intellectual mode of stimulation that human research has succeeded in discovering |  6 but the material basis of this stimulation unhappily we draw from the soil of one sole nation and that nation are we ever allowed to forget | capricious and silly beyond all that human experience could else have suggested as possible | in these circumstances it was not to be supposed that we should neglect any opening that offered for making ourselves independent of a nation which at all times we had so much reason to distrust as the chinese | might not the tea plant be made to prosper in some district of our indian empire | forty years ago we began to put forth organised botanical efforts for settling that question | forty years ago and even earlier according to my remembrance dr roxburgh in those days the paramount authority upon oriental botany threw some energy into this experiment for creating our own nurseries of the tea plant | but not until our burmese victories some thirty years since and our consequent treaties had put the province of assam into our power was i believe any serious progress made in this important effort | mr fortune has since applied the benefits of his scientific knowledge and the results of his own great personal exertions in the tea districts of china to the service of this most important speculation with what success i am not able to report | meantime it is natural to fear that the very possibility of doubts hanging over the results in an experiment so vitally national carries with it desponding auguries as to the ultimate issue | were the prospects in any degree cheerful it would be felt as a patriotic duty to report at short intervals all solid symptoms of progress made in this enterprise for it is an enterprise aiming at a triumph far more than scientific a triumph over a secret purpose of the chinese full of anti social malice and insolence against great britain | of late years as often as we have accomplished a victory over any insult to our national honour offered or meditated by the chinese they have recurred to some old historical tradition perhaps fabulous perhaps not of an emperor tartar or chinese who rather than submit to terms of equitable reciprocity in commercial dealings with a foreign nation or to terms implying an original equality of the two peoples caused the whole establishments and machinery connected with the particular traffic to be destroyed and all its living agents to be banished or beheaded | it is certain that in the contemplation of special contingencies likely to occur between themselves and the british the high mandarins dallied at intervals with this ancient precedent and forbore to act upon it partly under the salutary military panic which has for years been gathering gloomily over their heads but more imperatively perhaps from absolute inability to dispense with the weekly proceeds from the customs so eminently dependent upon the british shipping | money mere weight of dollars the lovely lunar radiance of silver this was the spell that moonstruck their mercenary hearts and kept them for ever see sawing 'willing to wound and yet afraid to strike '| now upon this a state of things suspected at times or perhaps known but not so established as that it could have been afterwards pleaded in evidence a very grave question arose but a question easily settled: had the chinese a right under the law of nations to act upon their malicious caprice | no man under any way of viewing the case hesitated in replying 'no '| china it was argued had possessed from the first a clear undoubted right to dismiss us with our business unaccomplished re infect if that business were the establishment of a reciprocal traffic | in the initial stage of the relations between the two powers the field was open to any possible movement in either party but according to the course which might be severally pursued on either side it was possible that one or both should so act as in the second stage of their dealings wilfully to forfeit this original liberty of action | rate the sun entered the room shortly after followed by aunt pepa | and finally came and as the saying goes this melon filled the pannier currito the beautiful accompanied rosie the tobacconist his beautiful sister | there were no guests came over because the mayor wanted his gathering was that night of the most intimate exclusive and creamy at the site could imagine | the room however shone like a blaze of gold because it was lit with three candles magnificent lucena of four burners each with some burning candles in the candlesticks on average cornucopias dozen beautiful hung on the walls on the upholstered red damask | ray knew the teacher to live and lived with all the pomp and pageantry befitting a man local | and it is sensed by certain signs and even sniffed and chewed almost thanks the pleasant whiff of crass and vapors through passages that came from the kitchen the room that night there would be no turkey in syrup and not just refrescanda but papandina also the most delicate and expensive | iv the teacher raymond had read quite a few newspapers and some books starting at several moral and political sciences and especially in a brand new that includes most and called sociology | but why not presumed speaker wise man or advice | his pride was estimated to be a man of action and completely practical | i make sure not to he had read the essays of lord macaulay but i think there are of them spanish version but if i had not read his merit was greater as agreed with the noble lord positivist one of its most unique thoughts | seneca had made an eloquent speech against anger which to no avail as no one knows a subject that has ceased get angry and make a thousand atrocities and convinced by the arguments corrected seneca | and as we do not know that anyone has gone without shoes made them a shoemaker and the lord as the master raymond inferred with judicious dialectic which is more useful than seneca in every human society the humblest of shoemakers | the teacher raymond by thus as was or had been a shoemaker and was ever humble is estimated at more than seneca especially with regard to utility and art of life | or seemed to despise despised oratory but without realizing it and letting snatch of his convictions speeches we often missed though rather than flowers vigorous and brief | now look at currito told the beautiful being present other persons who have listed: your way to proceed currito friend i have had enough and as i am mayor i will not consent continue | nobody has been charged with monitoring and girls and to zeal to paper knife in hand cato censorinus | you know that i belong to the liberal party which like now granted autonomy and several overseas provinces | consider then if not want to get angry your sister and my lady dona rosita marcela and let them autonomous ie completely free to do whatever they want | only in this way and not through violence fear or guardianship constant real merit will shine upon them the strength and persistence that retain their immaculate virtue defending it from all attacks and wiles of heartthrobs seductive | if they really

smugglers and traffickers | there can be kept to a woman says i do not know how wise and with good reason to what understand | in sum while the wise man was right and neither am i i have here the authority and strength which in this case more important than reason and i declare that if you continue intimidating people i do not scare me and drench you and if i insist i send to ceuta or melilla look there for your courage killing moors | if you're so brave why do not you go to cuba philippines or to scare and defeat the rebels rather than frighten the peaceful neighborhood i government now |  i a teacher i am well here and cursed the wins that i have to go to cuba or the philippines | with so do not you threaten me they will try and make amends | all my fury is penilla blame black and

will be softer than a glove | d antonio you strum that guitar and that these girls dance the fandango | currito has a good voice and style and sing the best songs | it was not necessary to say more | the organist played a fandango loud | rosita do a marcela and danced with grace and elegance clattering castanets | the teacher raymond aunt ramona do a pepa and clapped | it was such a din put together that it appeared that there had been seven but seven hundred people | when stopped clapping and castanets and guitar just sounded a voice sang currito sentimental and soft the following couplet: tie me to a hair sticks to your bed and although the hair to break there is no fear that i go | currito showed such a loving inspiration to sing and looked with eyes as sheep dying medium dona ramona who was sitting near him dona ramona was right not to be dominated by more time felt until melted and vaporized the ice of their disdain and discarding their purpose of casting rolling resistance and to some extent his lordly and masterful restraint he said to currito: come on man if the order has to be i do not molerte more | better is to ashamed to face undefiled in heart | do not tie it with a hair but i'll tie you to this thread wool that without you only knew i was making socks and thinking of you ingrat n fugitive driven | ramona then pulled the pocket of her apron a huge ball of brown wool there was unwrapped a couple of yards made a noose and threw currito taking him by the neck and holding him at the other end as a flange | they welcomed everyone to the end the teacher had made man and applauded even more than under further statements and promises of currito be recognized and there proclaim autonomy dona rosita and marcela | to solemnize both girls danced with remarkable sevillanas panache and expertise | three damsels bondage master raymond the three very neat and graceful served after dinner in the adjoining dining room | villalegre are still living in old fashioned | all the villagers ate the soup off and stew for two in the afternoon | was not surprising therefore that participants in the gathering they had hearty appetite at about eleven o'clock at night they served dinner | it was marinated pork preserved in lard like liquid rubies by the red color lent him the dressing | there was also roast turkey and anchovies fine wine of moriles and for dessert fruit and pi onate | finally as an appendix and supplement of such a sumptuous feast chocolate pastries macaroons and biscuits | the feast was even more elated and happy that delicious and lasted until two am | as a farewell wished the teacher raymond put the appropriate stamp and give strength to there had been concluded | imposed silence and spoke thus: i have in chinch n a good friend called d arturo gonzalez who is so deep sociologist and business manufacturer or grower double aniseed spirits | this product i sent him some bottles in which label now called tag is read amazement sociological spirit or liquid altruistic | i wanted to compete with my friend d arthur and without stealing his trademark aniseed spirits have done twice as well which is so altruistic and has a spirit as sociological as yours | these girls bring in individual trays drinks and spirits and chinch n villalegre | each of us will drink two glasses one of each class tell you what you like best and then provide well for the future consortium my sister and currito the beautiful as the glorious full autonomy and freedom of rosita and dona marcela | in effect brought the brandy and each drank two glasses | the opinions were divided | there chinch n who voted and who voted for villalegre there but as everyone drank at least second glass of brandy which he thought best the result came to be that went to three or four cups apiece | everything was then joy and mutual affection and proved that both were altruistic spirits and were endowed with equal spirit sociological | then the courtier d raymond thanks to several clear indications he soon convinced that under dona marcela was not anything to write home or independently or without autonomy | a few days later he returned d raimundo the court now convinced that the innocent idylls no easier than it in the most rustic and remote locations | in court he forgot dona marcela soon took aim at excelling as politician managed to escape deputy and who says there is a man of great promise it will become director general ambassador or minister and after the spanish government or when the papal grant him the title conde de

not asleep into the straw | keep up the tobacco and snuff buy even those who did not smoke before and smoke and tabacalera villalegre done in double or triple business | by buying stamps villalegrino mail is not to write more letters today he used to write | and finally rosita sells both stamped paper which is wonderful | to explain it rationally there are those who is considered certain that she does not receive or accept any loving statement if it is not written in folios of the peseta | dona ramona and currito meantime having become a teacher are becoming more adventurous and prosper corambres making and selling a lot | we do not know how he composed currito but the fact is fish that never knows the wine is poured into their skins which makes all handsome boots and also builds another kind of naked very especially designed to carry oil in them to the alpujarras mangurrinos because as they call in the alpujarra villalegre not produce oil | produce honey instead of cane sugar or raw honey which fill the bottles in the carriers leading oil and bring it to the province of cordoba | this honey delights cordovan the greedy local women who take the pulse dish bits soaking in it bread and looking like the pretty hands with fingers engarabitados as cockscomb | i am unable to decide what moral lesson can be drawn or what argument can be proved in view of events that have referred | shall i say simply that everyone take the moral lesson or prove the thesis that it wants or does not take moral lesson or test any thesis so is not reading my nag too | two japanese story my brother the hon | d jos delavat as minister of spain in japan had the good idea to send me there by mail a cute and curious mind | consists of twelve little volumes printed on paper so rare that looks more like fabric than paper and many beautiful paintings in the text | the painting is much more than what is written and is painted with great originality and grace | if it were written in japanese i would stay with the desire to understand because i do not know word of the language spoken or written in japan | i only know that the japanese have many books and some of them mostly novels are translated in several european languages particularly english french and german | for this the twelve little volumes or notebooks i have but printed and painted in tokyo in english and are stories for children so that japanese children learn english | it seems that these stories quite popular is taken word for word from the mouths of japanese nurses and must be so because the innocence of the narration reveals the clear | i have liked both these accounts not resist the temptation to put a pair of them in castilian | i choose the two that i find most interesting one because it differs a lot of almost all european vulgar tales and other so much that resembles certain christian legends such as san amaro the other saint referred to by the father arbiol in their desenga os mystics and has put in verse the american poet longfellow in his golden legend | without further introduction go beyond the stories | the mirror of matsuyama much time has lived two young couples in secluded rustic place | they had a daughter and they loved her with all my heart | i will not say the names of husband and wife which fell oblivion but i will say that the place they lived was called matsuyama in the province of echigo | there were to happen when she was still very tiny the father was forced to go to the big city capital of the empire | as so far neither the mother nor the child could accompany him and he was just saying goodbye and promising to bring them to the back very nice gifts | the mother had never been beyond the nearest village and thus could not throw some fear considering that her husband undertook the long journey but at the same time i felt proud satisfaction that it was he for all those contours the first man who went to the rich city where the king and the magnates lived and where there was to see so many beauties and wonders | finally when he learned the woman who became her husband the girl dressed in full dress as best he could and she wore a beautiful blue suit that he knew that he liked in the extreme | increase the cost could not quite happy with this good woman when she saw her husband return home safe and safe | the little one was clapping and smiling with delight at seeing his father toys brought | and he did not have enough of the extraordinary things he had seen during the pilgrimage and the capital itself |  to you told his wife i have brought a strange object of merit called mirror | look at him and tell me what you see inside | then gave a flat box of white wood where when he opened it found a metal disk | on one side was white and matte silver with ornaments in relief of birds and flowers and on the other bright and slick as glass | they looked at the young bride with pleasure and wonder because from its depth was looking at her with parted lips and eyes animated a face cheerful smile |  what do you see |  asked the husband loved the astonishment of her and very proud to show that there learned anything during his absence |  i see a pretty girl who looks at me and moves his lips as if speaking and carrying case strange | a blue dress exactly like mine |  silly it's your own face i see he said the man very satisfied to know something that his wife did not know this circle of metal is called mirror | in the city everyone has one but us here in the country we have not seen yet | women pleased with this he spent several days looking at every moment because as i said was the first time i saw a mirror and therefore the image of pretty face | it found however that such prodigious jewelry had on prices for used daily and kept in its box and carefully concealed between your dearest treasures | years passed and even husband and wife lived very happily | the spell of his life was the girl it grew and was the spitting image of his mother and so loving and good that everyone loved | thinking mother in their own passenger vanity to be so beautiful he kept hidden the mirror fearing that its use would pamper the child | as never spoke of the mirror father forgot everything | thus grew up the girl so simple and innocent as had been his mother ignoring her own beauty and that reflected the mirror | but there came a tremendous day misfortune came to this family until then so happy | the excellent and loving mother fell ill and although the daughter nursed with tender affection and attentive wakefulness it was getting worse and worse until there was hope but death | when she knew that was soon to leave her husband and her daughter was very sad grieve for those left on earth and especially for girls | called then and said: dear child you see i am very sick and soon i will die and leave you alone you and your beloved father | when i go away promise me you'll look in the mirror all days upon waking and at bedtime | in it i see and know that i am always looking out for you | with these words he showed the place where he was hiding the mirror | the girl promised to tears what her mother called and she calm and resigned was terminated recently | thereafter the obedient and virtuous girl never forgot the precept mother and every morning and every evening took place in the mirror that was hidden and looked at him for a long time intensely | there he saw the face of his lost mother bright and smiling | there was pale and sick and in his last days but beautiful and young | she confided her troubles night and sorrows of the day and she on waking encouragement and affection sought to fulfill their duties | in this way the child lived as monitored by his mother trying to please her in everything as when he lived and always taking care not to do anything that would grieve her or make her angry | its content was pure look in the mirror and say: mother today i was like you want me to be | said father after all that the girl looked blameless in the mirror every morning and night and it seemed like talking to him | then he asked the cause of this strange behavior | the girl replied: father every day i look in the mirror to see my dear mother and talk to her | he also noted the desire of his dying mother that she had never ceased to fulfill it | touched by so simply and so faithful and loving obedience he shed tears of pity and affection and never had the heart to discover her daughter to the image he saw in the mirror was the transcript of his own sweet figure the powerful and tender bond of filial love increasingly similar to that of his late mother | the pescadorcito urashima lived long time ago in the japan sea coast a pescadorcito called urashima nice guy and very smart with the rod and hook | one day out fishing in his boat but instead of catching a fish what do you think he picked | well took a big turtle with a shell very strong and an old face wrinkled and ugly and a rare corner | well i better know one thing that will no doubt know is that the turtles live a thousand years at least the living japanese | urashima who did not know he said to himself: a fish knows me so well for lunch and perhaps better than the turtle | what i have to kill this poor animal and depriving him of still living nine hundred ninety nine years | no no want to be so cruel | i am sure that my mother will approve what i do | and indeed took the turtle back into the sea | urashima happened shortly after that he slept in his boat | it was very hot weather of summer when almost no one is resisting at noon to take a nap | just fell asleep left the wave within a beautiful lady who got into the boat and said: i am the daughter of the god of the sea and live with my father in the dragon palace beyond the seas | it was not you caught the little turtle has and so generously put back into the water instead of killing | i myself was sent by my father the god of the sea to see if you were good or bad | now as we know you're good a great kid that repels all cruelty i have come to take me | if you want get married and live happily together over a thousand years in the dragon palace beyond the blue seas | urashima then took a paddle and other marine princess and rowed rowed arriving finally the dragon palace where the god of the sea lived and reigned as king over all the dragons turtles and fish | oh that was this site so enjoyable | the walls of the palace were of coral trees leaves were emeralds and rubies per fruit scales the fish were silver and the tails of dragons gold | think of all the most beautiful gorgeous and shining you saw in your life put together and maybe then conceive what the palace appeared | and all this belonged to urashima | and why not if he was the son of the god of the sea and the husband of the lovely princess | they lived happy for more than three years every day walking among the trees with leaves of emeralds and rubies fruit | but one morning his wife said urashima: very happy and pleased i am here | need however go home and see my father my mother my brothers and my sisters | let me go for a short time and soon return | and his friend titus therefore simply as the brother of domitian simply as a flavian he affected to regard as indirectly providing a wife when he urged his friend by marrying to enrol himself as a pillagee elect | the latter jest therefore when once apprehended speaks broadly and bitingly for itself | but the other what can it possibly mean | for centuries has that question been reiterated and hitherto without advancing by one step nearer to solution | isaac casaubon who about 230 years since was the leading oracle in this field of literature writing an elaborate and continuous commentary upon suetonius found himself unable to suggest any real aids for dispersing the thick darkness overhanging the passage | what he says is this: 'parum satisfaciunt mihi interpretes in explicatione hujus lami dicti | nam quod putant heu taceo suspirium esse ejus indicem doloris ob abductam uxorem magni sed latentis nobis non ita videtur sed notatam potius fuisse tyrannidem principis qui omnia in suo genere pulchra et excellentia possessoribus eriperet unde necessitas incumbebat sua bona dissimulandi celandique '| not at all satisfactory to me are the commentators in the explanation of the dictum which is here equivalent to dicterium of lamia | for whereas they imagine heu taceo to be a sigh of his the record and indication of a sorrow great though concealed on behalf of the wife that had been violently torn away from him me i confess that the case does not strike in that light but rather that a satiric blow was aimed at the despotism of the sovereign prince who tore away from their possessors all objects whatsoever marked by beauty or distinguished merit in their own peculiar class: whence arose a pressure of necessity for dissembling and hiding their own advantages | 'sic esse exponendum ' that such is the true interpretation continues casaubon 'docent illa verba laudanti vocem suam ' we are instructed by those words to one who praised his singing voice c | this commentary was obscure enough and did no honour to the native good sense of isaac casaubon usually so conspicuous | for whilst proclaiming a settlement in reality it settled nothing | naturally it made but a feeble impression upon the scholars of the day and not long after the publication of the book casaubon received from joseph scaliger a friendly but gasconading letter in which that great scholar brought forward a new reading namely greek: entakt to which he assigned a profound technical value as a musical term | no person even affected to understand scaliger | casaubon himself while treating so celebrated a man with kind and considerate deference yet frankly owned that in all his vast reading he had never met with this strange greek word | but without entering into any dispute upon that verbal question and conceding to scaliger the word and his own interpretation of the word no man could understand in what way this new resource was meant to affect the ultimate question at issue namely the extrication of the passage from that thick darkness which overshadowed it | 'as you were' to speak in the phraseology of military drill was in effect the word of command | all things reverted to their original condition | and two centuries of darkness again enveloped this famous perplexity of roman literature | the darkness had for a few moments seemed to be unsettling itself in preparation for flight: but immediately it rolled back again and through seven generations of men this darkness was heavier because less hopeful than before | now then i believe all things are ready for the explosion of the catastrophe 'which catastrophe ' i hear some malicious reader whispering 'is doubtless destined to glorify himself' meaning the unworthy writer of this little paper | i cannot deny it | a truth is a truth | and since no medal nor riband nor cross of any known order is disposable for the most brilliant successes in dealing with desperate or what may be called condemned passages in pagan literature mere sloughs of despond that yawn across the pages of many a heathen dog poet and orator that i could mention the more reasonable it is that a large allowance should be served out of boasting and self glorification to all those whose merits upon this field national governments have neglected to proclaim | the scaligers both father and son i believe acted upon this doctrine and drew largely by anticipation upon that reversionary bank which they conceived to be answerable for such drafts | joseph scaliger it strikes me was drunk when he wrote his letter on the present occasion and in that way failed to see what casaubon saw clearly enough that he had commenced shouting before he was out of the wood | for my own part if i go so far as to say that the result promises in the frenchman's phrase to 'cover me with glory ' i beg the reader to remember that the idea of 'covering' is of most variable extent: the glory may envelope one in a voluminous robe a princely mantle that may require a long suite of train bearers or may pinch and vice one's arms into that succinct garment now superannuated which some eighty years ago drew its name from the distinguished whig family in england of spencer | anticipating therefore that i shall nay insisting and mutinously if needful that i will be covered with glory by the approaching result i do not contemplate anything beyond that truncated tunic once known as a 'spencer ' and which is understood to cover only the shoulders and the chest | now then all being ready and the arena being cleared of competitors for i suppose it is fully understood that everybody but myself has retired from the contest thrice in fact has the trumpet sounded 'do you give it up '| some preparations there are to be made in all cases of contest | meantime let it be clearly understood what it is that the contest turns upon | supposing that one had been called like oedipus of old to a turn up with that venerable girl the sphinx most essential it would have been that the clerk of the course or however you designate the judge the umpire c | should have read the riddle propounded to greece: how else judge of the solution | at present the elements of the case to be decided stand thus: a roman noble a man in fact of senatorial rank has been robbed robbed with violence and with cruel scorn of a lovely young wife to whom he was most tenderly attached | but by whom | the indignant reader demands | by a younger son 8 of the roman emperor vespasian |  8 but holding what rank and what precise station at the time of the outrage | at this point i acknowledge a difficulty | the criminal was in this case domitian the younger son of vespasian the tenth c sar younger brother of titus the eleventh c sar and himself under the name of domitian the twelfth of the c sars consequently the closing prince in that series of the initial twelve c sars whom suetonius had undertaken to record | now the difficulty lies here which yet i have never seen noticed in any book: was this violence perpetrated before or after domitian's assumption of the purple | if after how then could the injured husband have received that advice from titus as to repairing his loss by a second marriage which forms part of an anecdote and a bon mot between titus and lamia | yet again if not after but before how was it lamia had not invoked the protection of vespasian or of titus the latter of whom enjoyed a theatrically fine reputation for equity and moderation | for some years the wrong has been borne in silence: the sufferer knew himself to be powerless as against such an oppressor and that to show symptoms of impotent hatred was but to call down thunderbolts upon his own head | generally therefore prudence had guided him | patience had been the word silence and below all the deep deep word wait and if by accident he were a christian not only that same word wait would have been heard but this beside look under the altars for others that also wait | but poor suffering patience sense of indignity that is hopeless must in order to endure have saintly resources | infinite might be the endurance if sustained only by a finite hope | but the black despairing darkness that revealed a tossing sea self tormented and fighting with chaos showing neither torch that glimmered in the foreground nor star that kept alive a promise in the distance violently refused to be comforted | it is beside an awful aggravation of such afflictions that the lady herself might have co operated in the later stages of the tragedy with the purposes of the imperial ruffian | lamia had been suffered to live because as a living man he yielded up into the hands of his tormentor his whole capacity of suffering no part of it escaped the hellish range of his enemy's eye | but this advantage for the torturer had also its weak and doubtful side | use and monotony might secretly be wearing away the edge of the organs on and through which the corrosion of the inner heart proceeded | on the whole therefore putting together the facts of the case it seems to have been resolved that he should die | but previously that he should drink off a final cup of anguish the bitterest that had yet been offered | the lady herself again that wife so known historically so notorious yet so total a stranger to man and his generations had she also suffered in sympathy with her martyred husband | that must have been known to a certainty in the outset of the case by him that knew too profoundly on what terms of love they had lived | but at length seeking for crowning torments it may have been that the dreadful c sar might have found the 'raw' in his poor victim that offered its fellowship in exalting the furnace of misery | the lady herself may we not suppose her at the last to have given way before the strengthening storm | possibly to resist indefinitely might have menaced herself with ruin whilst offering no benefit to her husband | and again though killing to the natural interests which accompany such a case might not the lady herself be worn out if no otherwise by the killing nature of the contest | there is besides this dreadful fact placed ten thousand times on record that the very goodness of the human heart in such a case ministers fuel to the moral degradation of a female combatant | any woman and exactly in proportion to the moral sensibility of her nature finds it painful to live in the same house with a man not odiously repulsive in manners or in person on terms of eternal hostility | in a community so nobly released as was rome from all base oriental bondage of women this followed that compliances of a nature oftentimes to belie the native nobility of woman become painfully liable to misinterpretation | possibly under the blinding delusion of secret promises unknown nay inaccessible to those outside all contemporaries being as ridiculously impotent to penetrate within the curtain as all posterity the wife of lamia once so pure may have been over persuaded to make such public manifestations of affection for domitian as had hitherto upon one motive or another been loftily withheld | things that to a lover carry along with them irreversible ruin carry with them final desolation of heart are to the vast current of ordinary men who regard society exclusively from a political centre less than nothing | do they deny the existence of other and nobler agencies in human affairs | not at all | readily they confess these agencies: but as movements obeying laws not known or imperfectly known to them these they ignore | what it was circumstantially that passed long since has been overtaken and swallowed up by the vast oblivions of time | this only survives namely that what he said gave signal offence in the highest quarter and that his death followed | but what was it that he did say | that is precisely the question and the whole question which we have to answer | at present we know and we do not know what it was that he said | we have bequeathed to us by history two words involving eight letters which in their present form with submission to certain grandees of classic literature mean exactly nothing | these two words must be regarded as the raw material upon which we have to work: and out of these we are required to turn out a rational saying for aelius lamia under the following five conditions: first it must allude to his wife as one that is lost to him irrecoverably secondly it must glance at a gloomy tyrant who bars him from rejoining her thirdly it must reply to the compliment which had been paid to the sweetness of his own voice fourthly it should in strictness contain some allusion calculated not only to irritate but even to alarm or threaten his jealous and vigilant enemy fifthly doing all these things it ought also to absorb as its own main elements the eight letters contained in the present senseless words 'heu taceo '| here is a monstrous quantity of work to throw upon any two words in any possible language | even shakspere's clown 9 when challenged to furnish a catholic answer applicable to all conceivable occasions cannot do it in less than nine letters namely oh lord sir | i for my part satisfied that the existing form of heu taceo was mere indictable and punishable nonsense but yet that this nonsense must enter as chief element into the stinging sense of lamia gazed for i cannot tell how many weeks at these impregnable letters viewing them sometimes as a fortress that i was called upon to escalade sometimes as an anagram that i was called upon to re organise into the life which it had lost through some dislocation of arrangement | finally the result in which i landed and which fulfilled all the conditions laid down was this: let me premise however what at any rate the existing darkness attests that some disturbance of the text must in some way have arisen whether from the gnawing of a rat or the spilling of some obliterating fluid at this point of some critical or unique ms | it is sufficient for us that the vital word has survived | i suppose therefore that lamia had replied to the friend who praised the sweetness of his voice 'sweet is it | ah would to heaven it might prove orpheutic '| ominous in this case would be the word orpheutic to the ears of domitian: for every school boy knows that this means a wife revoking voice | but first let me remark that there is such a legitimate word as orpheutaceam: and in that case the latin repartee of lamia would stand thus suavem dixisti | quam vellem et orpheutaceam | but perhaps reader you fail to recognise in this form our old friend heu taceo | but here he is to a certainty in spite of the rat: and in a different form of letters the compositor will show him up to you as vellem et orp |  heu taceam | possibly being in good humour you will be disposed to wink at the seemingly surreptitious am though believing the real word to be taceo | let me say therefore that one reading i believe gives taceam | here then shines out at once 1 eurydice the lovely wife 2 detained by the gloomy tyrant pluto 3 who however is forced into surrendering her to her husband whose voice the sweetest ever known drew stocks and stones to follow him and finally his wife 4 the word orpheutic involves an alarming threat showing that the hope of recovering the lady still survived 5 we have involved in the restoration all the eight or perhaps nine letters of the erroneous form |  9 in all's well that ends well | how to write english |  10 among world wide objects of speculation objects rising to the dignity of a mundane or cosmopolitish value which challenge at this time more than ever a growing intellectual interest is the english language | why particularly at this time | simply because the interest in that language rests upon two separate foundations: there are two separate principles concerned in its pretensions and by accident in part but in part also through the silent and inevitable march of human progress there has been steadily gathering for many years an interest of something like sceptical and hostile curiosity about each of these principles considered as problems open to variable solutions as problems already viewed from different national centres and as problems also that press forward to some solution or other with more and more of a clamorous emphasis in proportion as they tend to consequences no longer merely speculative and scholastic but which more and more reveal features largely practical and political | the two principles upon which the english language rests the burden of its paramount interest are these: first its powers the range of its endowments secondly its apparent destiny | some subtle judges in this field of criticism are of opinion and ever had that opinion that amongst the modern languages which originally had compass enough of strength and opulence in their structure or had received culture sufficient to qualify them plausibly for entering the arena of such a competition the english had certain peculiar and inappreciable aptitudes for the highest offices of interpretation | twenty five centuries ago this beautiful little planet on which we live might be said to have assembled and opened her first parliament for representing the grandeur of the human intellect | that particular assembly i mean for celebrating the olympic games about four centuries and a half before the era of christ when herodotus opened the gates of morning for the undying career of history by reading to the congregated children of hellas to the whole representative family of civilisation that loveliest of earthly narratives which in nine musical cantos unfolded the whole luxury of human romance as at the bar of some austere historic areopagus and inversely again which crowded the total abstract of human records sealed 11 as with the seal of delphi in the luxurious pavilions of human romance |  10 this fragment appeared in the instructor for july 1853 | the subject was not continued in any form h |  11 'sealed ' c : i do not believe that in the sense of holy conscientious loyalty to his own innermost convictions any writer of history in any period of time can have surpassed herodotus | and the reader must remember or if unlearned he must be informed that this judgment has now become the unanimous judgment of all the most competent authorities that is of all those who having first of all the requisite erudition as to greek as to classical arch ology c then subsequently applied this appropriate learning to the searching investigation of the several narratives authorised by herodotus | in the middle of the last century nothing could rank lower than the historic credibility of this writer | and to parody his title to be regarded as the 'father of history ' by calling him the 'father of lies ' was an unworthy insult offered to his admirable simplicity and candour by more critics than one | but two points startle the honourable reader who is loathe to believe of any laborious provider for a great intellectual interest that he can deliberately have meant to deceive: the first point and separately by itself an all sufficient demur is this that not in proportion to the learning and profundity brought to bear upon herodotus did the doubts and scruples upon his fidelity strengthen or multiply | precisely in the opposite current was the movement of human opinion as it applied itself to this patriarch of history | exactly as critics and investigators arose like larcher just reasonable thoughtful patient and combining or geographers as comprehensive and as accurate as major rennel regularly in that ratio did the reports and the judgments of herodotus command more and more respect | the other point is this and when it is closely considered it furnishes a most reasonable ground of demur to the ordinary criticisms upon herodotus | these criticisms build the principle of their objection generally upon the marvellous or romantic element which intermingles with the current of the narrative | but when a writer treats as to herodotus it happened that repeatedly he treated tracts of history far removed in space and in time from the domestic interests of his native land naturally he misses as any available guide the ordinary utilitarian relations which would else connect persons and events with great outstanding interests of his own contemporary system | the very abstraction which has silently been performed by the mere effect of vast distances wildernesses that swallow up armies and mighty rivers that are unbridged together with the indefinite chronological remoteness do already of themselves translate such sequestered and insulated chambers of history into the character of moral apologues where the sole surviving interest lies in the quality of the particular moral illustrated or in the sudden and tragic change of fortune recorded | such changes it is urged are of rare occurrence and recurring too often they impress a character of suspicious accuracy upon the narrative | doubtless they do so and reasonably where the writer is pursuing the torpid current of circumstantial domestic annals | but in the rapid abstract of herodotus where a century yields but a page or two and considering that two slender octavos on the particular scale adopted by herodotus embody the total records of the human race down to his own epoch really it would furnish no legitimate ground of scruple or jealousy though every paragraph should present us with a character that seems exaggerated or with an incident approaching to the marvellous or a catastrophe that is revolting | a writer is bound he has created it into a duty having once assumed the office of a national historiographer to select from the rolls of a nation such events as are the most striking | and a selection conducted on this principle through several centuries or pursuing the fortunes of a dynasty reigning over vast populations must end in accumulating a harvest of results such as would startle the sobriety of ordinary historic faith | if a medical writer should elect for himself of his own free choice to record such cases only in his hospital experience as terminated fatally it would be absurd to object the gloomy tenor of his reports as an argument for suspecting their accuracy since he himself by introducing this as a condition into the very terms of his original undertaking with the public has created against himself the painful necessity of continually distressing the sensibilities of his reader | to complain of herodotus or any public historian as drawing too continually upon his reader's profounder sensibilities is in reality to forget that this belongs as an original element to the very task which he has undertaken | to undertake the exhibition of human life under those aspects which confessedly bring it into unusual conflict with chance and change is by a mere self created necessity to prepare beforehand the summons to a continued series of agitations: it is to seek the tragic and the wondrous wilfully and then to complain of it as violating the laws of probability founded on life within the ordinary conditions of experience | that most memorable of panhellenic festivals it was which first made known to each other the two houses of grecian blood that typified its ultimate and polar capacities the most and the least of exorbitations the utmost that were possible from its equatorial centre viz on the one side the asiatic ionian who spoke the sweet musical dialect of homer and on the other side the austere dorian whom ten centuries could not teach that human life brought with it any pleasure or any business or any holiness of duty other or loftier than that of war | if it were possible that under the amenities of a grecian sky too fierce a memento could whisper itself of torrid zones under the stern discipline of the doric spartan it was that you looked for it or on the other hand if the lute might at intervals be heard or fancied warbling too effeminately for the martial european key of the grecian muses amidst the sweet blandishments it was of ionian groves that you arrested the initial elements of such a relaxing modulation | twenty five centuries ago when europe and asia met for brotherly participation in the noblest perhaps 12 of all recorded solemnities viz the inauguration of history in its very earliest and prelusive page the coronation as with propriety we may call it of the earliest perhaps even yet the greatest | historic artist what was the language employed as the instrument of so great a federal act | it was that divine grecian language to which on the model of the old differential compromise in favour of themistocles all rival languages would cordially have conceded the second honour | if now which is not impossible any occasion should arise for a modern congress of the leading nations that represent civilisation not probably in the isthmus of corinth but on that of darien it would be a matter of mere necessity and so far hardly implying any expression of homage that the english language should take the station formerly accorded to the grecian | but i come back to the thesis which i announced viz to the twofold onus which the english language is called upon to sustain: first to the responsibility attached to its powers secondly to the responsibility and weight of expectation attached to its destiny | to the questions growing out of the first i will presently return | but for the moment i will address myself to the nature of that destiny which is often assigned to the english language: what is it | and how far is it in a fair way of fulfilling this destiny |  12 perhaps seriously the most of a cosmopolitical act that has ever been attempted | next to it in point of dignity i should feel disposed to class the inauguration of the crusades | as early as the middle of the last century and by people with as little enthusiasm as david hume it had become the subject of plain prudential speculations in forecasting the choice of a subject or of the language in which it should reasonably be treated that the area of expectation for an english writer was prodigiously expanding under the development of our national grandeur by whatever names of 'colonial' or 'national' it might be varied or disguised | the issue of the american war and the sudden expansion of the american union into a mighty nation on a scale corresponding to that of the four great european potentates russia austria england and france was not in those days suspected | but the tendencies could not be mistaken | and the same issue was fully anticipated though undoubtedly through the steps of a very much slower process | whilst disputing about the items on the tess apettiele the disputed facts were overtaking us and flying past us on the most gigantic scale | all things were changing: and the very terms of the problem were themselves changing and putting on new aspects in the process and at the moment of enunciation | for instance it had been sufficiently seen that another christendom far more colossal than the old christendom of europe might and undoubtedly would form itself rapidly in america | against the tens of millions in europe would rise up like the earth born children of deucalion and pyrrha or of the theban cadmus and hermione american millions counted by hundreds | but from what radix | originally it would have been regarded as madness to take ireland in her celtic element as counting for anything | but of late whether rationally however i will inquire for a brief moment or so the counters have all changed in these estimates | the late mr o'connell was the parent of these hyperbolical anticipations | to count his ridiculous 'monster meetings' by hundreds of thousands and then at last by millions cost nobody so much as a blush and considering the open laughter and merriment with which all o'connell estimates were accepted and looked at i must think that the london standard was more deeply to blame than any other political party in giving currency and acceptation to the nursery exaggerations of mr o'connell | meantime those follies came to an end | mr o'connell died all was finished: and a new form of mendacity was transferred to america | there has always existed in the united states one remarkable phenomenon of irish politics applied to the deception of both english americans and irish | all people who have given any attention to partisanship and american politics are aware of a rancorous malice burning sullenly amongst a small knot of irishmen and applying itself chiefly to the feeding of an interminable feud against england and all things english | this as it chiefly expresses itself in american journals naturally passes for the product of american violence which in reality it is not | and hence it happens and for many years it has happened that both englishmen and americans are perplexed at intervals by a malice and an acharnement of hatred to england which reads very much like that atrocious and viperous malignity imputed to the father of hannibal against the romans | it is noticeable both as keeping open a peculiar exasperation of irish patriotism absurdly directed against england as doing a very serious injustice to americans who are thus misrepresented as the organs of this violence so exclusively irish and finally as the origin of the monstrous delusion which i now go on to mention | the pretence of late put forward is that the preponderant element in the american population is indeed derived from the british islands but by a vast overbalance from ireland and from the celtic part of the irish population | this monstrous delusion has recently received an extravagant sanction from the london quarterly review | half a dozen other concurrent papers in journals political and literary hold the same language | and the upshot of the whole is that whilst the whole english element including the earliest colonisation of the new england states at the beginning of the seventeenth century and including the whole stream of british emigration since the french revolution is accredited for no more than three and a half millions out of pretty nearly twenty millions of white american citizens on the other hand against this english element is set up an irish meaning a purely hiberno celtic element amounting oh genius of blushing whither hast thou fled to a total of eight millions | anglo saxon blood it seems is in a miserable minority in the united states whilst the german blood composes we are told a respectable nation of five millions and the irish celtic young noblemen though somewhat at a loss for shoes already count as high as eight millions | now if there were any semblance of truth in all this we should have very good reason indeed to tremble for the future prospects of the english language throughout the union | eight millions struggling with three and a half should already have produced some effect on the very composition of congress | meantime against these audacious falsehoods i observe a reasonable paper in the times august 23 1852 rating the celtic contribution from ireland that is exclusively of all the ulster contribution at about two millions which however i view as already an exaggeration considering the number that have always by preference resorted to the canadas | two millions whom poverty levity and utter want of all social or political consideration have reduced to ciphers the most absolute two millions in the very lowest and most abject point of political depression cannot do much to disturb the weight of the english language: which accordingly on another occasion i will proceed to consider with and without the aid of the learned dr gordon latham and sometimes if he will excuse me in defiance of that gentleman though far enough from defiance in any hostile or unfriendly sense | the casuistry of duelling |  13 this mention of allan cunningham recalls to my recollection an affair which retains one part of its interest to this day arising out of the very important casuistical question which it involves | we protestant nations are in the habit of treating casuistry as a field of speculation false and baseless per se nay we regard it not so much in the light of a visionary and idle speculation as one positively erroneous in its principles and mischievous for its practical results | this is due in part to the disproportionate importance which the church of rome has always attached to casuistry making in fact this supplementary section of ethics take precedency of its elementary doctrines in their catholic simplicity: as though the plain and broad highway of morality were scarcely ever the safe road but that every case of human conduct were to be treated as an exception and never as lying within the universal rule: and thus forcing the simple honest minded christian to travel upon a tortuous by road in which he could not advance a step in security without a spiritual guide at his elbow: and in fact whenever the hair splitting casuistry is brought with all its elaborate machinery to bear upon the simplicities of household life and upon the daily intercourse of the world there it has the effect and is expressly cherished by the romish church with a view to the effect of raising the spiritual pastor into a sort of importance which corresponds to that of an attorney | the consulting casuist is in fact to all intents and purposes a moral attorney | for as the plainest man with the most direct purposes is yet reasonably afraid to trust himself to his own guidance in any affair connected with questions of law so also when taught to believe that an upright intention and good sense are equally insufficient in morals as they are in law to keep him from stumbling or from missing his road he comes to regard a conscience keeper as being no less indispensable for his daily life and conversation than his legal agent or his professional 'man of business ' for the safe management of his property and for his guidance amongst the innumerable niceties which beset the real and inevitable intricacies of rights and duties as they grow out of human enactments and a complex condition of society | fortunately for the happiness of human nature and its dignity those holier rights and duties which grow out of laws heavenly and divine written by the finger of god upon the heart of every rational creature are beset by no such intricacies and require therefore no such vicarious agency for their practical assertion | the primal duties of life like the primal charities are placed high above us legible to every eye and shining like the stars with a splendour that is read in every clime and translates itself into every language at once | such is the imagery of wordsworth | but this is otherwise estimated in the policy of papal rome: and casuistry usurps a place in her spiritual economy to which our protestant feelings demur | so far however the question between us and rome is a question of degrees | they push casuistry into a general and unlimited application we if at all into a very narrow one | but another difference there is between us even more important for it regards no mere excess in the quantity of range allowed to casuistry but in the quality of its speculations: and which it is more than any other cause that has degraded the office of casuistical learning amongst us | questions are raised problems are entertained by the romish casuistry which too often offend against all purity and manliness of thinking | and that objection occurs forcibly here which southey either in the quarterly review or in his life of wesley has urged and expanded with regard to the romish and also the methodist practice of auricular confession viz that as it is practically managed not leaving the person engaged in this act to confess according to the light of his own conscience but at every moment interfering on the part of the confessor to suggest leading questions as lawyers call them and to throw the light of confession upon parts of the experience which native modesty would leave in darkness so managed the practice of confession is undoubtedly the most demoralising practice known to any christian society | innocent young persons whose thoughts would never have wandered out upon any impure images or suggestions have their ingenuity and their curiosity sent roving upon unlawful quests: they are instructed to watch what else would pass undetained in the mind and would pass unblameably on the miltonic principle: 'evil into the mind of god or man may come unblamed ' c | nay which is worst of all unconscious or semi conscious thoughts and feelings or natural impulses rising like a breath of wind under some motion of nature and again dying away because not made the subject of artificial review and interpretation are now brought powerfully under the focal light of the consciousness: and whatsoever is once made the subject of consciousness can never again have the privilege of gay careless thoughtlessness the privilege by which the mind like the lamps of a mail coach moving rapidly through the midnight woods illuminate for one instant the foliage or sleeping umbrage of the thickets and in the next instant have quitted them to carry their radiance forward upon endless successions of objects | this happy privilege is forfeited for ever when the pointed significancy of the confessor's questions and the direct knowledge which he plants in the mind have awakened a guilty familiarity with every form of impurity and unhallowed sensuality |  13 this appeared in tait's magazine for february 1841 | although practically an independent paper it was included in the series entitled 'sketches of life and manners from the autobiography of an english opium eater '| the reference to allan cunningham occurs in the previous chapter of these 'sketches ' h | here then are objections sound and deep to casuistry as managed in the romish church | every possible objection ever made to auricular confession applies with equal strength to casuistry and some objections besides these are peculiar to itself | and yet after all these are but objections to casuistry as treated by a particular church | casuistry in itself casuistry as a possible as a most useful and a most interesting speculation remains unaffected by any one of these objections for none applies to the essence of the case but only to its accidents or separable adjuncts | neither is this any curious or subtle observation of little practical value | the fact is as far otherwise as can be imagined the defect to which i am here pointing is one of the most clamorous importance | of what value let me ask is paley's moral philosophy | what is its imagined use | is it that in substance it reveals any new duties or banishes as false any old ones | no but because the known and admitted duties duties recognised in every system of ethics are here placed successfully or not upon new foundations or brought into relation with new principles not previously perceived to be in any relation whatever | this in fact is the very meaning of a theory 14 or contemplation greek: the ria when a b c old and undisputed facts have their relations to each other developed | it is not therefore for any practical benefit in action so much as for the satisfaction of the understanding when reflecting on a man's own actions the wish to see what his conscience or his heart prompts reconciled to general laws of thinking this is the particular service performed by paley's moral philosophy | it does not so much profess to tell what you are to do as the why and the wherefore and in particular to show how one rule of action may be reconciled to some other rule of equal authority but which apparently is in hostility to the first | such then is the utmost and highest aim of the paleyian or the ciceronian ethics as they exist | meantime the grievous defect to which i have adverted above a defect equally found in all systems of morality from the nichomach an ethics of aristotle downwards is the want of a casuistry by way of supplement to the main system and governed by the spirit of the very same laws which the writer has previously employed in the main body of his work | and the immense superiority of this supplementary section to the main body of the systems would appear in this that the latter i have just been saying aspires only to guide the reflecting judgment in harmonising the different parts of his own conduct so as to bring them under the same law whereas the casuistical section in the supplement would seriously undertake to guide the conduct in many doubtful cases of action cases which are so regarded by all thinking persons | take for example the case which so often arises between master and servant and in so many varieties of form a case which requires you to decide between some violation of your conscience on the one hand as to veracity by saying something that is not strictly true as well as by evading and that is often done all answer to inquiries which you are unable to meet satisfactorily a violation of your conscience to this extent and in this way or on the other hand a still more painful violation of your conscience in consigning deliberately some young woman faulty no doubt and erring but yet likely to derive a lesson from her own errors and the risk to which they have exposed her consigning her i say to ruin by refusing her a character and thus shutting the door upon all the paths by which she might retrace her steps | this i state as one amongst the many cases of conscience daily occurring in the common business of the world | it would surprise any reader to find how many they are in fact a very large volume might be easily collected of such cases as are of ordinary occurrence | casuistry the very word casuistry expresses the science which deals with such cases: for as a case in the declension of a noun means a falling away or a deflection from the upright nominative rectus so a case in ethics implies some falling off or deflection from the high road of catholic morality | now of all such cases one perhaps the most difficult to manage the most intractable whether for consistency of thinking as to the theory of morals or for consistency of action as to the practice of morals is the case of duelling |  14 no terms of art are used so arbitrarily and with such perfect levity as the terms hypothesis theory system | most writers use one or other with the same indifference that they use in constructing the title of a novel or suppose of a pamphlet where the phrase thoughts or strictures or considerations upon so and so are used ad libitum | meantime the distinctions are essential | that is properly an hypothesis where the question is about a cause: certain phenomena are known and given: the object is to place below these phenomena a basis greek: a hypothosis capable of supporting them and accounting for them | thus if you were to assign a cause sufficient to account for the aurora borealis that would be an hypothesis | but a theory on the other hand takes a multitude of facts all disjointed or at most suspected of some inter dependency: these it takes and places under strict laws of relation to each other | but here there is no question of a cause | finally a system is the synthesis of a theory and an hypothesis: it states the relations as amongst an undigested mass rudis indigestaque moles of known phenomena and it assigns a basis for the whole as in an hypothesis | these distinctions would become vivid and convincing by the help of proper illustrations | as an introduction i will state my story the case for the casuist and then say one word on the reason of the case | first let me report the case of a friend a distinguished lawyer at the english bar | i had the circumstances from himself which lie in a very small compass and as my friend is known to a proverb almost for his literal accuracy in all statements of fact there need be no fear of any mistake as to the main points of the case | he was one day engaged in pleading before the commissioners of bankruptcy a court then newly appointed and differently constituted i believe in some respects from its present form | that particular commissioner as it happened who presided at the moment when the case occurred had been recently appointed and did not know the faces of those who chiefly practised in the court | all things indeed concurred to favour his mistake: for the case itself came on in a shape or in a stage which was liable to misinterpretation from the partial view which it allowed of the facts under the hurry of the procedure and my friend also unluckily had neglected to assume his barrister's costume so that he passed in the commissioner's appreciation as an attorney | 'what if he had been an attorney '| it may be said: 'was he therefore less entitled to courtesy or justice '| certainly not nor is it my business to apologise for the commissioner | but it may easily be imagined and making allowances for the confusion of hurry and imperfect knowledge of the case it does offer something in palliation of the judge's rashness that amongst a large heap of 'old bailey' attorneys who notoriously attended this court for the express purpose of whitewashing their clients and who were in bad odour as tricksters he could hardly have been expected to make a special exception in favour of one particular man who had not protected himself by the insignia of his order | his main error however lay in misapprehending the case: misapprehension lent strength to the assumption that my friend was an 'old bailey' i e a sharking attorney whilst on the other hand that assumption lent strength to his misapprehension of the case | angry interruptions began: these being retorted or resented with just indignation produced an irritation and ill temper which of themselves were quite sufficient to raise a cloud of perplexity over any law process and to obscure it for any understanding | the commissioner grew warmer and warmer and at length he had the presumption to say: 'sir you are a disgrace to your profession '| when such sugar plums as captain m'turk the peacemaker observes were flying between them there could be no room for further parley | that same night the commissioner was waited on by a friend of the barrister's who cleared up his own misconceptions to the disconcerted judge placed him even to his own judgment thoroughly in the wrong and then most courteously troubled him for a reference to some gentleman who would arrange the terms of a meeting for the next day | the commissioner was too just and grave a man to be satisfied with himself on a cool review of his own conduct | here was a quarrel ripened into a mortal feud likely enough to terminate in wounds or possibly in death to one of the parties which on his side carried with it no palliations from any provocation received or from wrong and insult in any form sustained: these in an aggravated shape could be pleaded by my friend but with no opening for retaliatory pleas on the part of the magistrate | that name again of magistrate increased his offence and pointed its moral: he a conservator of the laws he a dispenser of equity sitting even at the very moment on the judgment seat he to have commenced a brawl nay to have fastened a quarrel upon a man even then of some consideration and of high promise a quarrel which finally tended to this result shoot or be shot | that commissioner's situation and state of mind for the succeeding night were certainly not enviable: like southey's erring painter who had yielded to the temptation of the subtle fiend with repentance his only companion he lay and a dismal companion is she | meantime my friend what was his condition and how did he pass the interval | i have heard him feelingly describe the misery the blank anguish of this memorable night | sometimes it happens that a man's conscience is wounded but this very wound is the means perhaps by which his feelings are spared for the present: sometimes his feelings are lacerated but this very laceration makes the ransom for his conscience | here on the contrary his feelings and his happiness were dimmed by the very same cause which offered pain and outrage to his conscience | he was upon principle a hater of duelling | under any circumstances he would have condemned the man who could for a light cause or almost for the weightiest have so much as accepted a challenge | yet here he was positively offering a challenge and to whom | to a man whom he scarcely knew by sight whom he had never spoken to until this unfortunate afternoon and towards whom now that the momentary excitement of anger had passed away he felt no atom of passion or resentment whatsoever | as a free 'unhoused' young man therefore had he been such without ties or obligations in life he would have felt the profoundest compunction at the anticipation of any serious injury inflicted upon another man's hopes or happiness or upon his own | but what was his real situation | he was a married man married to the woman of his choice within a very few years: he was also a father having one most promising son somewhere about three years old | his young wife and his son composed his family and both were dependent in the most absolute sense for all they possessed or they expected for all they had or ever could have upon his own exertions | abandoned by him losing him they forfeited in one hour every chance of comfort respectability or security from scorn and humiliation | the mother a woman of strong understanding and most excellent judgment good and upright herself liable therefore to no habit of suspicion and constitutionally cheerful went to bed with her young son thinking no evil | midnight came one two o'clock mother and child had long been asleep nor did either of them dream of that danger which even now was yawning under their feet | the barrister had spent the hours from ten to two in drawing up his will and in writing such letters as might have the best chance in case of fatal issue to himself for obtaining some aid to the desolate condition of those two beings whom he would leave behind unprotected and without provision | oftentimes he stole into the bedroom and gazed with anguish upon the innocent objects of his love and as his conscience now told him of his bitterest perfidy | 'will you then leave us | are you really going to betray us | will you deliberately consign us to life long poverty and scorn and grief '| these affecting apostrophes he seemed in the silence of the night to hear almost with bodily ears | silent reproaches seemed written upon their sleeping features and once when his wife suddenly awakened under the glare of the lamp which he carried he felt the strongest impulse to fly from the room but he faltered and stood rooted to the spot | she looked at him smilingly and asked why he was so long in coming to bed | he pleaded an excuse which she easily admitted of some law case to study against the morning or some law paper to draw | she was satisfied and fell asleep again | he however fearing above all things that he might miss the time for his appointment resolutely abided by his plan of not going to bed for the meeting was to take place at chalk farm and by half past five in the morning: that is about one hour after sunrise | one hour and a half before this time in the gray dawn just when the silence of nature and of mighty london was most absolute he crept stealthily and like a guilty thing to the bedside of his sleeping wife and child took what he believed might be his final look of them: kissed them softly and according to his own quotation from coleridge's remorse in agony that could not be remembered and a conflict with himself that defied all rehearsal he quitted his peaceful cottage at chelsea in order to seek for the friend who had undertaken to act as his second | he had good reason from what he had heard on the night before to believe his antagonist an excellent shot and having no sort of expectation that any interruption could offer to the regular progress of the duel he as the challenger would have to stand the first fire at any rate conceiving this to be the fair privilege of the party challenged he did not mean to avail himself of any proposal for drawing lots upon the occasion even if such a proposal should happen to be made | thus far the affair had travelled through the regular stages of expectation and suspense but the interest of the case as a story was marred and brought to an abrupt conclusion by the conduct of the commissioner | he was a man of known courage but he also was a man of conscientious scruples and amongst other instances of courage had the courage to own himself in the wrong | he felt that his conduct hitherto had not been wise or temperate and that he would be sadly aggravating his original error by persisting in aiming at a man's life upon which life hung also the happiness of others merely because he had offered to that man a most unwarranted insult | feeling this he thought fit at first coming upon the ground to declare that having learned since the scene in court the real character of his antagonist and the extent of his own mistake he was resolved to brave all appearances and ill natured judgments by making an ample apology which accordingly he did and so the affair terminated | i have thought it right however to report the circumstances both because they were really true in every particular but much more because they place in strong relief one feature which is often found in these cases and which is allowed far too little weight in distributing the blame between the parties: to this i wish to solicit the reader's attention | during the hours of this never to be forgotten night of wretchedness and anxiety my friend's reflection was naturally forced upon the causes which had produced it | in the world's judgment he was aware that he himself as the one charged with the most weighty responsibility those who depended upon him being the most entirely helpless would have to sustain by much the heaviest censure: and yet what was the real proportion of blame between the parties | he when provoked and publicly insulted had retorted angrily: that was almost irresistible under the constitution of human feelings the meekest of men could scarcely do less | but surely the true onus of wrong and moral responsibility for all which might follow rested upon that party who giving way to mixed impulses of rash judgment and of morose temper had allowed himself to make a most unprovoked assault upon the character of one whom he did not know well aware that such words uttered publicly by a person in authority must by some course or other be washed out and cancelled or if not that the party submitting to such defamatory insults would at once exile himself from the society and countenance of his professional brethren | now then in all justice it should be so ordered that the weight of public indignation might descend upon him whoever he might be and of course the more heavily according to the authority of his station and his power of inflicting wrong who should thus wantonly abuse his means of influence to the dishonour or injury of an unoffending party | we clothe a public officer with power we arm him with influential authority over public opinion not that he may apply these authentic sanctions to the backing of his own malice and giving weight to his private caprices: and wherever such abuse takes place then it should be so contrived that some reaction in behalf of the injured person might receive a sanction equally public | and upon this point i shall say a word or two more after first stating my own case a case where the outrage was far more insufferable more deliberate and more malicious but on the other hand in this respect less effectual for injury that it carried with it no sanction from any official station or repute in the unknown parties who offered the wrong | the circumstances were these: in 1824 i had come up to london upon an errand in itself sufficiently vexatious of fighting against pecuniary embarrassments by literary labours but as had always happened hitherto with very imperfect success from the miserable thwartings i incurred through the deranged state of the liver | my zeal was great and my application was unintermitting but spirits radically vitiated chiefly through the direct mechanical depression caused by one important organ deranged and secondly by a reflex effect of depression through my own thoughts in estimating my prospects together with the aggravation of my case by the inevitable exile from my own mountain home all this reduced the value of my exertions in a deplorable way | it was rare indeed that i could satisfy my own judgment even tolerably with the quality of any literary article i produced and my power to make sustained exertions drooped in a way i could not control every other hour of the day: insomuch that what with parts to be cancelled and what with whole days of torpor and pure defect of power to produce anything at all very often it turned out that all my labours were barely sufficient some times not sufficient to meet the current expenses of my residence in london | three months' literary toil terminated at times in a result 0 the whole plus being just equal to the minus created by two separate establishments and one of them in the most expensive city of the world | gloomy indeed was my state of mind at that period: for though i made prodigious efforts to recover my health sensible that all other efforts depended for their result upon this elementary effort which was the conditio sine qua non for the rest yet all availed me not and a curse seemed to settle upon whatever i then undertook | such was my frame of mind on reaching london: in fact it never varied | one canopy of murky clouds a copy of that dun atmosphere which settles so often upon london brooded for ever upon my spirits which were in one uniformly low key of cheerless despondency and on this particular morning my depression had been deeper than usual from the effects of a long continuous journey of 300 miles and of exhaustion from want of sleep | i had reached london about six o'clock in the morning by one of the northern mails and resigning myself as usual in such cases to the chance destination of the coach after delivering our bags in lombard street i was driven down to a great city hotel | here there were hot baths and somewhat restored by this luxurious refreshment about eight o'clock i was seated at a breakfast table upon which in a few minutes as an appendage not less essential than the tea service one of the waiters laid that morning's times just reeking from the press | the times by the way is notoriously the leading journal of europe anywhere but in london and more peculiarly in the city quarter of london it enjoys a pre eminence scarcely understood elsewhere | here it is not a morning paper but the morning paper: no other is known no other is cited as authority in matters of fact | strolling with my eye indolently over the vast babylonian confusion of the enormous columns naturally as one of the corps litt raire i found my attention drawn to those regions of the paper which announced forthcoming publications | amongst them was a notice of a satirical journal very low priced and already advanced to its third or fourth number | my heart palpitated a little on seeing myself announced as the principal theme for the malice of the current number | the reader must not suppose that i was left in any doubt as to the quality of the notice with which i had been honoured and that by possibility i was solacing my vanity with some anticipation of honeyed compliments | that i can assure him was made altogether impossible by the kind of language which flourished in the very foreground of the programme and even of the running title | the exposure and depluming to borrow a good word from the fine old rhetorician fuller of the leading 'humbugs' of the age that was announced as the regular business of the journal: and the only question which remained to be settled was the more or less of the degree and also one other question even more interesting still viz whether personal abuse were intermingled with literary | happiness as i have experienced in other periods of my life deep domestic happiness makes a man comparatively careless of ridicule of sarcasm or of abuse | but calamity the degradation in the world's eye of every man who is fighting with pecuniary difficulties exasperates beyond all that can be imagined a man's sensibility to insult | he is even apprehensive of insult tremulously fantastically apprehensive where none is intended and like wordsworth's shepherd with his very understanding consciously abused and depraved by his misfortunes is ready to say at all hours and every man i met or faced methought he knew some ill of me | some notice perhaps the newspaper had taken of this new satirical journal or some extracts might have been made from it at all events i had ascertained its character so well that in this respect i had nothing to learn | it now remained to get the number which professed to be seasoned with my particular case and it may be supposed that i did not loiter over my breakfast after this discovery | something which i saw or suspected amongst the significant hints of a paragraph or advertisement made me fear that there might possibly be insinuations or downright assertion in the libel requiring instant public notice and therefore on a motive of prudence had i even otherwise felt that indifference for slander which now i do feel but which in those years morbid irritability of temperament forbade me to affect i should still have thought it right to look after the work which now i did: and by nine o'clock in the morning an hour at which few people had seen me for years i was on my road to smithfield |smithfield  yes even so | all known and respectable publishers having declined any connexion with the work the writers had facetiously resorted to this aceldama or slaughtering quarter of london to these vast shambles as typical i suppose of their own slaughtering spirit | on my road to smithfield i could not but pause for one moment to reflect on the pure defecated malice which must have prompted an attack upon myself | retaliation or retort it could not pretend to be | to most literary men scattering their written reviews or their opinions by word of mouth to the right and the left with all possible carelessness it never can be matter of surprise or altogether of complaint unless as a question of degrees that angry notices or malicious notices should be taken of themselves | few indeed of literary men can pretend to any absolute innocence from offence and from such even as may have seemed deliberate | but i for my part could | knowing the rapidity with which all remarks of literary men upon literary men are apt to circulate i had studiously and resolutely forborne to say anything whether of a writer or a book unless where it happened that i could say something that would be felt as complimentary | and as to written reviews so much did i dislike the assumption of judicial functions and authority over the works of my own brother authors and contemporaries that i have in my whole life written only two at that time only one and that one though a review of an english novel was substantially a review of a german book taking little notice or none of the english translator for although he a good german scholar now was a very imperfect one at that time and was therefore every way open to criticism i had evaded this invidious office applied to a novice in literature and after pointing out one or two slight blemishes of trivial importance all that i said of a general nature was a compliment to him upon the felicity of his verses | upon the german author i was indeed severe but hardly as much as he deserved | the other review was a tissue of merriment and fun and though it is true i did hear that the fair authoress was offended at one jest i may safely leave it for any reader to judge between us | she or her brother amongst other latin epigrams had one addressed to a young lady upon the loss of her keys | this the substance of the lines showed to have been the intention but by a very venial error in one who was writing latin from early remembrance of it and not in the character of a professing scholar the title was written de clavis instead of de clavibus amissis upon which i observed that the writer had selected a singular topic for condolence with a young lady viz 'on the loss of her cudgels ' clavis as an ablative coming clearly from clava | this but i can hardly believe it was said to have offended miss h and at all events this was the extent of my personalities | many kind things i had said much honour much admiration i had professed at that period of my life in occasional papers or private letters towards many of my contemporaries but never anything censorious or harsh and simply on a principle of courteous forbearance which i have felt to be due towards those who are brothers of the same liberal profession with one's self | i could not feel when reviewing my whole life that in any one instance by act by word or by intention i had offered any unkindness far less any wrong or insult towards a brother author | i was at a loss therefore to decipher the impulse under which the malignant libeller could have written in making as i suspected already my private history the subject of his calumnies | jealousy i have since understood jealousy was the foundation of the whole | a little book of mine had made its way into drawing rooms where some book of his had not been heard of | on reaching smithfield i found the publisher to be a medical bookseller and to my surprise having every appearance of being a grave respectable man notwithstanding this undeniable fact that the libellous journal to which he thought proper to affix his sanction trespassed on decency not only by its slander but in some instances by downright obscenity and worse than that by prurient solicitations to the libidinous imagination through blanks seasonably interspersed | i said nothing to him in the way of inquiry for i easily guessed that the knot of writers who were here clubbing their virus had not so ill combined their plans as to leave them open to detection by a question from any chance stranger | having therefore purchased a set of the journal then amounting to three or four numbers i went out and in the elegant promenades of smithfield i read the lucubrations of my libeller | fit academy for such amenities of literature | fourteen years have gone by since then and possibly the unknown hound who yelled on that occasion among this kennel of curs may long since have buried himself and his malice in the grave | suffice it here to say that calm as i am now and careless on recalling the remembrance of this brutal libel at that time i was convulsed with wrath | as respected myself there was a depth of malignity in the article which struck me as perfectly mysterious | how could any man have made an enemy so profound and not even have suspected it | that puzzled me | for with respect to the other objects of attack such as sir humphrey davy c it was clear that the malice was assumed that at most it was the gay impertinence of some man upon town armed with triple irish brass from original defect of feeling and willing to raise an income by running amuck at any person just then occupying enough of public interest to make the abuse saleable | but in my case the man flew like a bull dog at the throat with a pertinacity and acharnement of malice that would have caused me to laugh immoderately had it not been for one intolerable wound to my feelings | these mercenary libellers whose stiletto is in the market and at any man's service for a fixed price callous and insensible as they are yet retain enough of the principles common to human nature under every modification to know where to plant their wounds | like savage hackney coachmen they know where there is a raw | and the instincts of human nature teach them that every man is vulnerable through his female connexions | there lies his honour there his strength there his weakness | in their keeping is the heaven of his happiness in them and through them the earthy of its fragility | many there are who do not feel the maternal relation to be one in which any excessive freight of honour or sensibility is embarked | neither is the name of sister though tender in early years and impressive to the fireside sensibilities universally and through life the same magical sound | a sister is a creature whose very property and tendency qua sister is to alienate herself not to gather round your centre | but the names of wife and daughter these are the supreme and starry charities of life: and he who under a mask fighting in darkness attacks you there that coward has you at disadvantage | i stood in those hideous shambles of smithfield: upwards i looked to the clouds downwards to the earth for vengeance | i trembled with excessive wrath such was my infirmity of feeling at that time and in that condition of health and had i possessed forty thousand lives all and every one individually i would have sacrificed in vindication of her that was thus cruelly libelled | shall i give currency to his malice shall i aid and promote it by repeating it |no  and yet why not | why should i scruple as if afraid to challenge his falsehoods why should i scruple to cite them | he this libeller asserted but faugh | this slander seemed to have been built upon some special knowledge of me for i had often spoken with horror of those who could marry persons in a condition which obliged them to obedience a case which had happened repeatedly within my own knowledge and i had spoken on this ground that the authority of a master might be supposed to have been interposed whether it really were so or not in favour of his designs and thus a presumption however false it might be always remained that his wooing had been perhaps not the wooing of perfect freedom so essential to the dignity of woman and therefore essential to his own dignity but that perhaps it had been favoured by circumstances and by opportunities created if it had not even been favoured by express exertions of authority | the libeller therefore did seem to have some knowledge of my peculiar opinions: yet in other points either from sincere ignorance or from affectation and by way of turning aside suspicion he certainly manifested a non acquaintance with facts relating to me that must have been familiar enough to all within my circle | let me pursue the case to its last stage | the reader will say perhaps why complain of a paltry journal that assuredly never made any noise for i the reader never heard of it till now | no that is very possible for the truth is and odd enough it seems this malicious journal prospered so little that positively at the seventh no | it stopped | laugh i did and laugh i could not help but do at this picture of baffled malice: writers willing and ready to fire with poisoned bullets and yet perfectly unable to get an effective aim from sheer want of co operation on the part of the public | however the case as it respected me went farther than it did with respect to the public | would it be believed that human malice with respect to a man not even known by sight to his assailants as was clear from one part of their personalities finally that is to say months afterwards adopted the following course: the journal had sunk under public scorn and neglect neglect at first but perhaps scorn at the last for when the writers found that mere malice availed not to draw public attention they adopted the plan of baiting their hooks with obscenity and they published a paper professing to be written by lord byron called 'my wedding night ' and very possible from internal evidence to have been really written by him and yet the combined forces of byron and obscenity failed to save them which is rather remarkable | having sunk one might suppose the journal was at an end for good and evil and especially that all who had been molested by it or held up to ridicule might now calculate on rest | by no means: first of all they made inquiries about the localities of my residence and the town nearest to my own family | nothing was effected unless they carried the insult addressed to my family into the knowledge of that family and its circle | my cottage in grasmere was just 280 miles from london and eighteen miles from any town whatsoever | the nearest was kendal a place of perhaps 16 000 inhabitants and the nearest therefore at which there were any newspapers printed | there were two: one denominated the gazette the other the chronicle | the first was tory and conservative had been so from its foundation and was besides generous in its treatment of private character | my own contributions to it i will mention hereafter | the chronicle on the other hand was a violent reforming journal and conducted in a partisan spirit | to this newspaper the article was addressed by this newspaper it was published and by this it was carried into my own 'next door' neighbourhood | next door neighbourhood | but that surely must be the very best direction these libellers could give to their malice for there at least the falsehood of their malice must be notorious | why yes: and in that which was my neighbourhood according to the most literal interpretation of the term a greater favour could not have been done me nor a more laughable humiliation for my unprovoked enemies | commentary or refutation there needed none the utter falsehood of the main allegations were so obvious to every man woman and child that of necessity it discredited even those parts which might for any thing known to my neighbours have been true | nay it was the means of procuring for me a generous expression of sympathy that would else have been wanting for some gentlemen of the neighbourhood who were but slightly known to me put the malignant journal into the fire at a public reading room | so far was well but on the other hand in kendal a town nearly twenty miles distant of necessity i was but imperfectly known and though there was a pretty general expression of disgust at the character of the publication and the wanton malignity which it bore upon its front since true or not true no shadow of a reason was pleaded for thus bringing forward statements expressly to injure me or to make me unhappy yet there must have been many in so large a place who had too little interest in the question or too limited means of inquiry for ever ascertaining the truth | consequently in their minds to this hour my name as one previously known to them and repeatedly before the town in connexion with political or literary articles in their conservative journal must have suffered | but the main purpose for which i have reported the circumstances of these two cases relates to the casuistry of duelling | casuistry as i have already said is the moral philosophy of cases that is of anomalous combinations of circumstances that for any reason whatsoever do not fall or do not seem to fall under the general rules of morality | as a general rule it must doubtless be unlawful to attempt another man's life or to hazard your own | very special circumstances must concur to make out any case of exception and even then it is evident that one of the parties must always be deeply in the wrong | but it does strike me that the present casuistry of society upon the question of duelling is profoundly wrong and wrong by manifest injustice | very little distinction is ever made in practice by those who apply their judgments to such cases between the man who upon principle practises the most cautious self restraint and moderation in his daily demeanour never under any circumstance offering an insult or any just occasion of quarrel and resorting to duel only under the most insufferable provocation between this man on the one side and the most wanton ruffian on the other who makes a common practice of playing upon other men's feelings whether in reliance upon superior bodily strength or upon the pacific disposition of conscientious men and fathers of families | yet surely the difference between them goes the whole extent of the interval between wrong and right | even the question 'who gave the challenge '| which is sometimes put often merges virtually in the transcendant question 'who gave the provocation '| for it is important to observe in both the cases which i have reported that the onus of offering the challenge was thrown upon the unoffending party and thus in a legal sense that party is made to give the provocation who in a moral sense received it | but surely if even the law makes allowances for human infirmity when provoked beyond what it can endure we in our brotherly judgments upon each other ought a fortiori to take into the equity of our considerations the amount and quality of the offence | it will be objected that the law so far from allowing for expressly refuses to allow for sudden sallies of anger or explosions of vindictive fury unless in so far as they are extempore and before the reflecting judgment has had time to recover itself | any indication that the party had leisure for calm review or for a cool selection of means and contrivances in executing his vindictive purposes will be fatal to a claim of that nature | this is true but the nature of a printed libel is continually to renew itself as an insult | the subject of it reads this libel perhaps in solitude and by a great exertion of self command resolves to bear it with fortitude and in silence | some days after in a public room he sees strangers reading it also: he hears them scoffing and laughing loudly: in the midst of all this he sees himself pointed out to their notice by some one of the party who happens to be acquainted with his person and possibly if the libel take that particular shape which excessive malice is most likely to select he will hear the name of some female relative dearer it may be to him and more sacred in his ears than all this world beside bandied about with scorn and mockery by those who have not the poor excuse of the original libellers but are in fact adopting the second hand malignity of others | such cases with respect to libels that are quickened into popularity by interesting circumstances or by a personal interest attached to any of the parties or by wit or by extraordinary malice or by scenical circumstances or by circumstances unusually ludicrous are but too likely to occur and with every fresh repetition the keenness of the original provocation is renewed and in an accelerated ratio | again with reference to my own case or to any case resembling that let it be granted that i was immoderately and unreasonably transported by anger at the moment i thought so myself after a time when the journal which published the libel sank under the public neglect but this was an after consideration and at the moment how heavy an aggravation was given to the stings of the malice by the deep dejection from embarrassed circumstances and from disordered health which then possessed me aggravations perhaps known to the libellers as encouragements for proceeding at the time and often enough likely to exist in other men's cases | now in the case as it actually occurred it so happened that the malicious writers had by the libel dishonoured themselves too deeply in the public opinion to venture upon coming forward in their own persons to avow their own work but suppose them to have done so as in fact even in this case they might have done had they not published their intention of driving a regular trade in libel and in slander suppose them insolently to beard you in public haunts to cross your path continually when in company with the very female relative upon whom they had done their best to point the finger of public scorn and suppose them further by the whole artillery of contemptuous looks words gestures and unrepressed laughter to republish as it were ratify and publicly to apply personally their own original libel as often as chance or as opportunity eagerly improved should throw you together in places of general resort and suppose finally that the central figure nay in their account the very butt throughout this entire drama of malice should chance to be an innocent gentle hearted dejected suffering woman utterly unknown to her persecutors and selected as their martyr merely for her relationship to yourself suppose her in short to be your wife a lovely young woman sustained by womanly dignity or else ready to sink into the earth with shame under the cruel and unmanly insults heaped upon her and having no protector upon earth but yourself: lay all this together and then say whether in such a case the most philosophic or the most christian patience might not excusably give way whether flesh and blood could do otherwise than give way and seek redress for the past but at all events security for the future in what perhaps might be the sole course open to you an appeal to arms | let it not be said that the case here proposed by way of hypothesis is an extreme one: for the very argument has contemplated extreme cases: since whilst conceding that duelling is an unlawful and useless remedy for cases of ordinary wrong where there is no malice to resist a more conciliatory mode of settlement and where it is difficult to imagine any deliberate insult except such as is palliated by intoxication conceding this i have yet supposed it possible that cases may arise with circumstances of contumely and outrage growing out of deep inexorable malice which cannot be redressed as things now are without an appeal to the voye de fait | 'but this is so barbarous an expedient in days of high civilisation '| why yes it labours with the semi barbarism of chivalry: yet on the other hand this mention of chivalry reminds me to say that if this practice of duelling share the blame of chivalry one memorable praise there is which also it may claim as common to them both | it is a praise which i have often insisted on and the very sublime of prejudice i would challenge to deny it | burke in his well known apology for chivalry thus expresses his sense of the immeasurable benefits which it conferred upon society as a supplementary code of law reaching those cases which the weakness of municipal law was then unavailing to meet and at a price so trivial in bloodshed or violence he calls it 'the cheap defence of nations '| yes undoubtedly and surely the same praise belongs incontestably to the law of duelling | for one duel in esse there are ten thousand every day of our lives amid populous cities in posse: one challenge is given a myriad are feared: one life and usually the most worthless by any actual good rendered to society is sacrificed suppose triennially from a nation every life is endangered by certain modes of behaviour | hence then and at a cost inconceivably trifling the peace of society is maintained in cases which no law no severity of police ever could effectually reach | brutal strength would reign paramount in the walks of public life brutal intoxication would follow out its lawless impulses were it not for the fear which now is always in the rear the fear of being summoned to a strict summary account liable to the most perilous consequences | this is not open to denial: the actual basis upon which reposes the security of us all the peace of our wives and our daughters and our own immunity from the vilest degradations under their eyes is the necessity known to every gentleman of answering for his outrages in a way which strips him of all unfair advantages except one which is not often possessed which places the weak upon a level with the strong and the quiet citizen upon a level with the military adventurer or the ruffian of the gambling house | the fact i say cannot be denied neither can the low price be denied at which this vast result is obtained | and it is evident that on the principle of expediency adopted as the basis of morality by paley the justification of duelling is complete: for the greatest sum of immediate happiness is produced at the least possible sacrifice |  15 but there are many men of high moral principle and yet not professing to rest upon christianity who reject this prudential basis of ethics as the death of all morality | and these men hold that the social recognition of any one out of the three following dangerous and immoral principles viz 1st that a man may lawfully sport with his own life 2dly that he may lawfully sport with the life of another 3dly that he may lawfully seek his redress for a social wrong by any other channel than the law tribunals of the land: that the recognition of these or any of them by the jurisprudence of a nation is a mortal wound to the very key stone upon which the whole vast arch of morality reposes | well in candour i must admit that by justifying in courts of judicature through the verdicts of juries that mode of personal redress and self vindication to heal and prevent which was one of the original motives for gathering into social communities and setting up an empire of public law as paramount to all private exercise of power a fatal wound is given to the sanctity of moral right of the public conscience and of law in its elementary field | so much i admit but i say also that the case arises out of a great dilemma with difficulties on both sides and that in all practical applications of philosophy amongst materials so imperfect as men just as in all attempts to realize the rigour of mathematical laws amongst earthly mechanics inevitably there will arise such dilemmas and cases of opprobrium to the reflecting intellect | however in conclusion i shall say four things which i request my opponent whoever he may be to consider for they are things which certainly ought to have weight and some important errors have arisen by neglecting them |  15 neither would it be open to paley to plead that the final or remotest consequences must be taken into the calculation and that one of these would be the weakening of all moral sanctions and thus indirectly an injury to morality which might more than compensate the immediate benefit to social peace and security for this mode of arguing the case would bring us back to the very principle which his own implicitly or by involution rejects: since it would tell us to obey the principle itself without reference to the apparent consequences | by the bye paley has an express section of his work against the law of honour as a valid rule of action but as cicero says of epicurus it matters little what he says the question for us is quam sibi convenienter how far consistently with himself | now as sir james mackintosh justly remarks all that paley says in refutation of the principle of worldly honour is hollow and unmeaning | in fact it is merely one of the commonplaces adopted by satire and no philosophy at all | honour for instance allows you upon paying gambling debts to neglect or evade all others: honour again allows you to seduce a married woman: and he would secretly insinuate that honour enjoins all this but it is evident that honour simply forbears to forbid all this: in other words it is a very limited rule of action not applying to one case of conduct in fifty | it might as well be said that ecclesiastical courts sanction murder because that crime lies out of their jurisdiction | first then let him remember that it is the principle at stake viz the recognition by a legal tribunal as lawful or innocent of any attempt to violate the laws or to take the law into our own hands: this it is and the mortal taint which is thus introduced into the public morality of a christian land thus authentically introduced thus sealed and countersigned by judicial authority the majesty of law actually interfering to justify with the solemnities of trial a flagrant violation of law this it is this only and not the amount of injury sustained by society which gives value to the question | i would do anything for the sake of you and d francisco no rosalie said briskly hurt to hear the name of her husband | this is my business exclusively | nor is there to do anything bringas find out oh it's up to me mine ah ya refugio muttered looking again staring at the eyebrows | rosalie said that after observing it the damn tossed back into the sewing is it finally softened and took out the tickets |no   he made a gesture of person who strives in character to overcome his weakness and repeated i can not i can not and you do not get me who would get it | by you or by d francisco do the impossible and i take away the bread from their mouths | believe me i have afraid of my lack of character i am very silly and if you make me cry a lot i might soften and fall into the folly of paying the money the stupid yes because i badly needed it |  nothing rosalie thought made a basilisk | this shameless you want me to kneel front i do not see it | aloud affecting a calm that was far from having he said: if such extortion get tired there is nothing said |  i can not i can not | it's a big commitment which i have expressed the sanchez the tone of one who cuts a question |  well do not worry with that and how have you been to bathrooms | this complete change in the conversation put rosalia on tenterhooks | bent the blade | no had to think about the loan | the stupid question of the lady replied summer the first nonsense that came into his mouth | at that moment i felt so hot that it would lying in soak to prevent complete combustion of your body at all |  daughter made here a horrible embarrassment |  wait timber entornar less light to enter | for a while the pipa n with the heart in her mouth looked at the pictures of bullfighters adorn the wall | one appeared confused with the agonizing discomfort of his soul | he subdued his desire dignity in such a way that did not hesitate a bit more humble | giving a tap with her fan refugio's knee spoke these words which had to give not without difficulty a slightly warm twang: go woman lend that money | what   refugio asked surprised | ah money | believe me i remembered the such a thing but what makes it so necessary | is it so hard the flush | frankly i i thought you was a revenue not taking | in this mischievous observation would have answered those swinging rosalia matted unkempt | but what could i do | bitterness and undergo swallowing everything |  yes child commitment is fuertecillo | if you want you will interest at your convenience |  jesus i do not offend you | if i pay you what you want and i am sorry not to be in a situation i would without interest | among people in the family should not be otherwise | when he heard of this good piece pipa n that was among the family was about to lose his temper it was too much to resist punishment that ordnance | rosalia gritted teeth with few faces were needed to mimic smiles |  i must be foaming at the mouth i thought | if i go from here soon i think i give something | refugio again put his hand into the sewing room and took the bundle of banknotes | jesus divine | if the end be resolved | la de bringas saw her with undisguised lust rubbing and review notes as if the count | then shaking his head in despair said the very if i do not have nothing ah madam it is not possible it is not possible | but the package did not save where i was but put it on the fireplace | this detail dead stoked hopes of rosalia |  for look you added the other stretching on the couch like a bed and playing his feet almost the knees of the lady here that i see i'm ruined | i got into i do not understand business and as i have no character all have taken advantage of my pavisoser a to exploit | at first fine sea salt and sand i received gender ladies come and take him through the roof | as it was all the best and not expensive indeed | but when they played to pay here i want to see |  let me wait a week goes that'll stop by there that again that i have that makes which turns and finale misery and cheating | oh how madrid this everything looks | said a gentleman i know that this is a carnival every day in which the poor are rich dress | and here except half a dozen all are poor | facha ma'am and nothing more than facade | these people knows no indoor facilities | living on the street and dress well and be able to go the theater no family that stays all year round tortilla chips i know ladies of employees who are laid off half of the year and glad to see them as goons | seem duchesses princes and children | how so | i do not know | said a gentleman i know that is full of such mysteries madrid | many do not eat to dress but some they manage otherwise i know stories ah i've seen the world such are seeking the life such as negotiating the cloth and then talk about others as if they were not worse |  total that what i have become sold more than half: the other half is on the loose out there and no christian that the copper | blow pots phantoms | and then came here giving a ratatouille vast say to me i do not cheat anyone i live for my work | but half a world deceive you and you want to make silk dresses with the bread of the poor and hear you blow smoke in those mouths criticizing and looking down on other poor | some has been that after looking at me over his shoulder and do not to pay me a thousand tangles have come here asking for money and what would it be |  perhaps to give to his beloved | when you release the string with an emphasis and a heat declared her possessed be very case of the unfortunate candidate threw burning eyes | this greatly inflating nostrils eyes downcast the weary breath heard and gagged and contained their furious desire to do or say whatever nonsense | xlvii 'that's audacity had told her for the cynicism with which you talk about women whose shoe does not deserve to be barefoot you should start the viper's tongue and then publicly whip the streets naked from the waist up well well well | in his mind gave him the lashes and put it in the flesh | tan and bringas was flown and big effort needed to do to restrain himself he found preferable to any disaster domestic horrible torment he suffered |  i'm going i thought i can not endure | i prefer i despise my husband and enslave me to me spit this miserable face like me spitting | but in thinking this figur base see mr de torquemada exposing d francisco with donut in front the obligation to satisfy the debt then we represented the angry husband no with all the power of his imagination could not represent the anger of that noble holy man as an enemy of tangles |  before that he concluded by saying everything everything including that early strawberry stomp me i single step the shame nobody knows me and no one has to take me to the face |  a gentleman friend of mine going from shelter said that tone of jovial convinced the light told me that everything here is pobreter a that there's no real aristocracy and the great most of those passing by the rich and skulls are nothing more than a cheesy because you see what country in the world is a lady with a title like telleria asking a thousand walk provided real how i order them to me | this has been who has been shot by real have lost six hundred to a letter | and when a young gentleman to spend one hundred clarets a woman they say has ruined the family | they do not want to talk about living in caps as muchitos whom i know who go to theaters with tickets given away traveling free and get dressed up and used by others all for pretend |  when i see these such i get i very hollow because they owe anyone and if so i'll pay vivo of my work and nobody has to do with my actions and the first thing i say is that deception to anyone that i do not want so leave me are you because of mine as celestina di levante and go to bring us coffee | do you want coffee |   thank you said rosalie with despondency and spent the forces | rose to retire | i hated that woman so much and thereby hurt his pride ordinariness of these expressions and the baseness of those thoughts that would not humiliate more | shelter stopped her by the arm saying in a laugh: you really do not want you to take coffee with us | wait that's going to give me the money | rosalie sat down and alegr sele the soul with these words | that little devil in front of him and that made him a thousand faces indecent it became a human and even enjoyable |  it's two room rosalia sighed unable to stop smiling and finding particular grace in the big mouth and jagged teeth of refuge |  what time have to pay |  a three let's say the other is with great spontaneity |  still have time | they heard the sound of the door had slammed celestina to go in search of coffee | the tooth less stretching more and taking a more than lazy vulgar we he laughed very rude: if the lady were here would not you those apurillos because lie at his feet and cry a little they say that mrs comfort to all the friends that you go with stories and having mean or dissolute husbands | already seen if i had in my hand as it all the money in the nation would too | but let you be which already comply accounts | said a gentleman who comes home that now really is armed |  but how many men you know great point |  i would have said rosalie had been in a position to be severe | you try with all the knights of the human race | is there no one you pull a slap all your remaining teeth and which incidentally they are beautiful |   yes it is now he said confidently refuge a change of scenery go with god | there shall be freedom freedom this lack of respect this way of speaking of his majesty so angry at the lady who was about to upset all his circumspection and reached the infamous and say to learn to speak as they should taking scratch | satisfied with two or three monosyllables of disapproval | his face was already like a pepper | in one of those handfuls which gave the sanchez threw a basket that was on fire and he dropped a pack cigars |  do you also smoke cochinaza |  would it rosalia asked if i could speak with spontaneity but looked at from the ground to collect another packet and said nothing | soon came the waiter with the coffee and left the service on the nightstand | it was necessary to remove many things to make room | shelter and celestina after repeating his invitation to rosalia were prepared to take it | both were given the same treatment respectively tuteaban be equally frank | i said it was not known which of the two was the maid and what the lady but really celestina was defeated a little more than the other |  virgen del carmen |  rosalie said to himself | with what people have gotten me |  if the lord i removed the good of this evil way never again make another such |  celeste nicked said in a friendly way what i do my hair today | the other explained his delay with how much he had to do | everything was still not fixed the cabinet as a den the bedroom as well when refugees ended up taking their coffee and celestina began to put some order in the cabinet rosalia unable to restrain his impatience slammed shut the fan it must be very late | perhaps a quarter to three |  the worst of all shelter said toying with his victim is that now i remember if i can not i can not give you anything | i had already forgotten today this very evening i have to pay two thousand and some real | rosalia firmly believed that a snake was coiled around his chest squeezing to drown | he had just strength to say anything | it seemed rushed to nail him on that miserable devilish face ten nails of his upper extremities | but this is sometimes think and want is rarely done | rose could only articulate a guttural sound weak expression of their anger the grip of dignity |  he's playing me like a cat with a ball of paper thought | i'm going if not the drowning |  wait for you said refugio | i can think of one thing | just who has promised to help you so i would not go back | the word is a word imperial emperor s nchez and above all in the case of the family release the family of your filthy mouth had told rosalie |  well it occurs to me that i can ask a friend |  but you take charge of the time it is |  rosalia said regaining hope |  if you live near here on calle de la sal but you're with that quiet |  quia i have time to comb |celestina   women not have time | refugio stood | rosalia taking some steps toward her grabbed her dress and cupped making a move to put it lie down this dress you wear a robe a scarf over her head refugio went to the bedroom | since she said: my corset | and he took it rosalia and helped him ce rselo | when they were in such an operation the sly was allowed to say this: well mr fish could relieve you of these bays but it always takes him with money | now walk the poor tronadillo | rosalie said nothing | shame burned his face and oppressed his heart | what made was tightening the corset and pull cord furiously as if to split into two halves the body of the devil |  madam by god i divide you i do not trouble me much | that is left to gordon who want to wear a sylph like tallecito do you think do you peinar |  no rec gete hair with a hairnet with a ribbon so you very well you better with that hair disheveled you look like a herodias's in

| finally sanchez put the ticket in his hand oh how she felt in her soul rest the unfortunate lady |  for if the devil is happening remove them decided to leave without delay |  what are you going |  it's too late | i can not miss a minute | you know i really appreciate it | ah want we make a recibito |  you do not said refuge to boot by drawing a noble and selfless | it is therefore the seconds who are the proper objects of notice for courts of honour and the error has been in framing the project of such a court to imagine the inquiry too much directed upon the behaviour of those who cease to be free agents from the very moment that they become liable to any legal investigation whatever: simply as quarrellers the parties are no objects of question they are not within the field of any police review and the very first act which brings them within that field translates the responsibility because the free agency from themselves to their seconds | the whole questio vexata therefore reduces itself to these logical moments to speak the language of mathematics: the two parties mainly concerned in the case of duelling are society and the seconds | the first by authorising such a mode of redress the latter by conducting it | now i presume it will be thought hopeless to arraign society at the bar of any earthly court or apply any censure or any investigation to its mode of thinking |  16 to the principals for the reasons given it would be unjust to apply them and the inference is that the seconds are the parties to whom their main agency should be directed as the parties in whose hands lies the practical control of the whole affair and the whole machinery of opportunities so easily improved by a wise humanity for sparing bloodshed for promoting reconciliation for making those overtures of accommodation and generous apology which the brave are so ready to agree to in atonement for hasty words or rash movements of passion but which it is impossible for them to originate | in short for impressing the utmost possible spirit of humanising charity and forbearance upon a practice which after all must for ever remain somewhat of an opprobrium to a christian people but which tried by the law of worldly wisdom is the finest bequest of chivalry the most economic safety valve for man's malice that man's wit could devise the most absolute safe guard of the weak against the brutal and finally once more to borrow the words of burke in a sense the fullest and most practical 'the cheap defence of nations ' not indeed against the hostility which besieges from without but against the far more operative nuisance of bad passions that vex and molest the social intercourse of men by ineradicable impulses from within |  16 if it be asked by what title i represent society as authorising nay as necessitating duels i answer that i do not allude to any floating opinions of influential circles in society for these are in continual conflict and it may be difficult even to guess in which direction the preponderance would lie | i build upon two undeniable results to be anticipated in any regular case of duel and supported by one uniform course of precedent: first that in a civil adjudication of any such case assuming only that it has been fairly conducted and agreeably to the old received usages of england no other verdict is ever given by a jury than one of acquittal | secondly that before military tribunals the result is still stronger for the party liable to a challenge is not merely acquitted as a matter of course if he accepts it with any issue whatsoever but is positively dishonoured and degraded nay even dismissed the service virtually under colour of a request that he will sell out if he does not | these precedents form the current law for english society as existing amongst gentlemen | duels pushed l'outrance and on the savage principles adopted by a few gambling ruffians on the continent of which a good description is given in the novel of the most unfortunate man in the world or by old buccaneering soldiers of napoleon at war with all the world and in the desperation of cowardice demanding to fight in a saw pit or across a table this sort of duels is as little recognised by the indulgence of english law as in the other extreme the mock duels of german burschen are recognised by the gallantry of english society | duels of the latter sort would be deemed beneath the dignity of judicial inquiry: duels of the other sort beyond its indulgence | but all other duels fairly managed in the circumstances are undeniably privileged amongst non military persons and commanded to those who are military | i may illustrate the value of one amongst the suggestions i have made by looking back and applying it to part of my last anecdote: the case of that promising person who was cut off so prematurely for himself and so ruinously for the happiness of the surviving antagonist | i may mention as a fact known to me on the very best authority that the duke of wellington was consulted by a person of distinction who had been interested in the original dispute with a view to his opinion upon the total merits of the affair on its validity as a 'fighting' quarrel and on the behaviour of the parties to it | upon the last question the opinion of his grace was satisfactory | his bias undoubtedly if he has any is likely to lie towards the wisdom of the peacemaker and possibly like many an old soldier he may be apt to regard the right of pursuing quarrels by arms as a privilege not hastily to be extended beyond the military body | but on the other question as to the nature of the quarrel the duke denied that it required a duel or that a duel was its natural solution | and had the duke been the mediator it is highly probable that the unfortunate gentleman would now have been living | certainly the second quarrel involved far less of irritating materials than the first | it grew out of a hasty word and nothing more such as drops from parliamentary debaters every night of any interesting discussion drops hastily is as hastily recalled or excused perhaps as a venial sally of passion either by the good sense or the magnanimity of the party interested in the wrong | indeed by the unanimous consent of all who took notice of the affair the seconds or one of them at least in this case must be regarded as deeply responsible for the tragical issue nor did i hear of one person who held them blameless except that one who of all others might the most excusably have held them wrong in any result | but now from such a case brought under the review of a court such as i have supposed and improved in the way i have suggested a lesson so memorable might have been given to the seconds by a two years' imprisonment punishment light enough for the wreck of happiness which they caused that soon from this single case raised into a memorable precedent there would have radiated an effect upon future duels for half a century to come | and no man can easily persuade me that he is in earnest about the extinction of duelling who does not lend his countenance to a suggestion which would at least mitigate the worst evils of the practice and would by placing the main agents in responsibility to the court bring the duel itself immediately under the direct control of that court would make a legal tribunal not reviewers subsequently but in a manner spectators of the scene and would carry judicial moderation and skill into the very centre of angry passions not as now they act inefficiently to review and by implication sometimes to approve their most angry ebullitions but practically to control and repress them | the love charm | a tale from the german of tieck |  17 emilius was sitting in deep thought at his table awaiting his friend roderick | the light was burning before him the winter evening was cold and to day he wished for the presence of his fellow traveller though at other times wont rather to avoid his society: for on this evening he was about to disclose a secret to him and beg for his advice | the timid shy emilius found in every business and accident of life so many difficulties such insurmountable hindrances that it might seem to have been an ironical whim of his destiny which brought him and roderick together roderick being in everything the reverse of his friend | inconstant flighty always determined by the first impression and kindling in an instant he engaged in everything had a plan for every occasion no undertaking was too arduous for him no obstacle could deter him | but in the midst of the pursuit he slackened and wearied just as suddenly as at first he had caught fire and sprung forward | whatever then opposed him was for him not a spur to urge him onward but only led him to abandon what he had so hotly rushed into so that roderick was every day thoughtlessly beginning something new and with no better cause relinquishing and idly forgetting what he had begun the day before | hence never a day passed but the friends got into a quarrel which seemed to threaten the death of their friendship and yet what to all appearance thus severed them was perhaps the very thing that most closely bound them together each loved the other heartily but each found passing satisfaction in being able to discharge the most justly deserved reproaches upon his friend |  17 see the remarks in prefatory note vol | i emilius a rich young man of a susceptible and melancholy temperament on the death of his parents had become master of his fortune | he had set out on a journey in order thereby to complete his education but had now already spent several months in a large town for the sake of enjoying the pleasures of the carnival about which he never gave himself the least trouble and of making certain arrangements of importance about his fortune with some relations to whom as yet he had scarcely paid a visit | on the road he had fallen in with the restless ever shifting and veering roderick who was living at variance with his guardians and who to free himself wholly from them and their burdensome admonitions eagerly grasped at the opportunity held out to him by his new friend of becoming his companion on his travels | during their journey they had often been on the point of separating but each after every dispute had only felt the more clearly that he could not live without the other | scarce had they left their carriage in any town when roderick had already seen everything remarkable in it to forget it all again on the morrow while emilius took a week to acquire a thorough knowledge of the place from his books lest he should omit seeing anything that was to be seen and after all from indolence and indifference thought there was hardly anything worth his while to go and look at | roderick had immediately made a thousand acquaintances and visited every public place of entertainment often too he brought his new made friends to the lonely chamber of emilius and would then leave him alone with them as soon as they began to tire him | at other times he would confound the modest emilius by extravagantly praising his merits and his acquirements before intelligent and learned men and by giving them to understand how much they might learn from his friend about languages or antiquities or the fine arts although he himself could never find time for listening to him on such subjects when the conversation happened to turn on them | but if emilius ever chanced to be in a more active mood he might almost make sure of his truant friend having caught cold the night before at a ball or a sledge party and being forced to keep his bed so that with the liveliest most restless and most communicative of men for his companion emilius lived in the greatest solitude | to day he confidently expected him for roderick had been forced to give him a solemn promise of spending the evening with him in order to learn what it was that for weeks had been depressing and agitating his thoughtful friend | meanwhile emilius wrote down the following lines: 'tis sweet when spring its choir assembles and every nightingale is steeping the trees in his melodious weeping till leaf and bloom with rapture trembles | fair is the net which moonlight weaves fair are the breezes' gambolings as with lime odours on their wings they chase each other through the leaves | bright is the glory of the rose when love's rich magic decks the earth from countless roses love looks forth those stars wherewith love's heaven glows | but sweeter fairer brighter far to me that little lamp's pale gleaming when through the narrow casement streaming it bids me hail my evening star as from their braids her locks she flings then twines them in a flowery band while at each motion of her hand the white robe to her fair form clings or when she breaks her lute's deep slumbers and as at morning's touch up darting the notes beneath her fingers starting dance o'er the strings in playful numbers | to stop their flight her voice she pours full after them they laugh and fly and to my heart for refuge hie her voice pursues them through its doors | leave me ye fierce ones | hence remove | they bar themselves within and say 'till this be broken here we stay that thou mayst know what 'tis to love '| emilius arose fretfully | it grew darker and roderick came not and he was wishing to tell him of his love for an unknown fair one who dwelt in the opposite house and who kept him all day long at home and waking through many a night | at length footsteps sounded up the stairs the door opened without anybody knocking at it and in walked two gay masks with ugly visages one a turk dressed in red and blue silk the other a spaniard in pale yellow and pink with many waving feathers on his hat | as emilius was becoming impatient roderick took off his mask showed his well known laughing countenance and said: 'heyday my good friend what a drowned puppy of a face | is this the way to look in carnival time | i and our dear young officer are come to fetch you away | there is a grand ball to night at the masquerade rooms and as i know you have forsworn ever going out in any other suit than that which you always wear of the devil's own colour come with us as black as you are for it is already somewhat late '| emilius felt angry and said: 'you have it seems according to custom altogether forgotten our agreement | i am extremely sorry ' he continued turning to the stranger 'that i cannot possibly accompany you my friend has been over hasty in promising for me indeed i cannot go out at all having something of importance to talk to him about '| the stranger who was well bred and saw what emilius meant withdrew but roderick with the utmost indifference put on his mask again placed himself before the glass and said: 'verily i am a hideous figure am i not | to say the truth it is a tasteless worthless disgusting device '| 'that there can be no question about ' answered emilius in high indignation | 'making a caricature of yourself and making a fool of yourself are among the pleasures you are always driving after at full gallop '| 'because you do not like dancing yourself ' said the other 'and look upon dancing as a mischievous invention not a soul in the world must wear a merry face | how tiresome it is when a person is made up of nothing but whims '| 'doubtless '| replied his angry friend 'and you give me ample opportunity for finding that it is so | i thought after our agreement you would have given me this evening but ' 'but it is the carnival you know ' pursued the other 'and all my acquaintances and certain fair ladies are expecting me at the grand ball to night | assure yourself my good friend it is mere disease in you that makes you so unreasonable against all such matters '| 'which of us has the fairest claim to disease ' said emilius 'i will not examine | at least your inconceivable frivolousness your hunger and thirst after stop gaps for every hour you are awake your wild goose chase after pleasures that leave the heart empty seem not to me altogether the healthiest state of the soul | in certain things at all events you might make a little allowance for my weakness if it must once for all pass for such: and there is nothing in the world that so jars through and through me as a ball with its frightful music | somebody once said that to a deaf person who cannot hear the music a set of dancers must look like so many patients for a mad house but in my opinion this dreadful music itself this twirling and whirling and pirouetting of half a dozen notes each treading on its own heels in those accursed tunes which ram themselves into our memories yea i might say mix themselves up with our very blood so that one cannot get rid of their taint for many a miserable day after this to me is the very trance of madness and if i could ever bring myself to think dancing endurable it must be dancing to the tune of silence '| 'well done signor paradox monger '| exclaimed the mask | 'why you are so far gone that you think the most natural most innocent and merriest thing in the world unnatural ay and shocking '| 'i cannot change my feelings ' said his grave friend | 'from my very childhood these tunes have made me wretched and have often well nigh driven me out of my senses | they are to me the ghosts and spectres and furies in the world of sound and come thus and buzz round my head and grin at me with horrid laughter '| 'all nervous irritability '| returned the other 'just like your extravagant abhorrence of spiders and many other harmless insects '| 'harmless you call them ' cried emilius now quite untuned 'because you have no repugnance toward them | to one however who feels the same disgust and loathing the same nameless horror that i feel rise up in his soul and shoot through his whole being at the sight of them these miscreate deformities such as toads spiders or that most loathsome of nature's excrements the bat are not indifferent or insignificant: their very existence is directly at enmity and wages war with his | in truth one might smile at the unbelievers whose imagination is too barren for ghosts and fearful spectres and those births of night which we see in sickness to take root therein or who stare and marvel at dante's descriptions when the commonest every day life brings before our eyes such frightful distorted master pieces among the works of horror | yet can we really and faithfully love the beautiful without being stricken with pain at the sight of such monstrosities '| 'wherefore stricken with pain '| asked roderick | 'why should the great realm of the waters and the seas present us with nothing but those terrors which you have accustomed yourself to find there | why not rather look on such creatures as strange entertaining and ludicrous mummers and on the whole region in the light of a great masked ball room | but your whims go still further for as you love roses with a kind of idolatry there are many flowers for which you have a no less vehement hatred: yet what harm has the dear good tulip ever done you or all the other dutiful children of summer that you persecute | so again you have an aversion to many colours to many scents and to many thoughts and you take no pains to harden yourself against these weaknesses but yield to them and sink down into them as into a luxurious feather bed and i often fear i shall lose you altogether some day and find nothing but a patchwork of whims and prejudices sitting at that table instead of my emilius '| emilius was wrath to the bottom of his heart and answered not a word | he had long given up all design of making his intended confession nor did the thoughtless roderick show the least wish to hear the secret which his melancholy friend had announced to him with such an air of solemnity | he sat carelessly in the arm chair playing with his mask when he suddenly cried: 'be so kind emilius as to lend me your large cloak '| 'what for '| asked the other | 'i hear music in the church on the opposite side of the street ' answered roderick 'and this hour has hitherto escaped me every evening since we have been here | to day it comes just as if called for | i can hide my dress under your cloak which will also cover my mask and turban and when it is over i can go straight to the ball '| emilius muttered between his teeth as he looked in the wardrobe for his cloak then constraining himself to an ironical smile gave it to roderick who was already on his legs | 'there is my turkish dagger which i bought yesterday ' said the mask as he wrapped himself up 'put it by for me it is a bad habit carrying about toys of cold steel: one can never tell what ill use may be made of them should a quarrel arise or any other knot which it is easier to cut than to untie | we meet again to morrow farewell a pleasant evening to you '| he waited for no reply but hastened down stairs | when emilius was alone he tried to forget his anger and to fix his attention on the laughable side of his friend's behaviour | after a while his eyes rested upon the shining finely wrought dagger and he said: 'what must be the feelings of a man who could thrust this sharp iron into the breast of an enemy | but oh what must be those of one who could hurt a beloved object with it | he locked it up then gently folded back the shutters of his window and looked across the narrow street | but no light was there all was dark in the opposite house the dear form that dwelt in it and that used about this time to show herself at her household occupations seemed to be absent | 'perhaps she is at the ball ' thought emilius little as it suited her retired way of life | suddenly however a light entered the little girl whom his beloved unknown had about her and with whom during the day and evening she busied herself in various ways carried a candle through the room and closed the window shutters | an opening remained light large enough for over looking a part of the little chamber from the spot where emilius stood and there the happy youth would often bide till after midnight fixed as though he had been charmed there | he was full of gladness when he saw her teaching the child to read or instructing her in sewing and knitting | upon inquiry he had learnt that the little girl was a poor orphan whom his fair maiden had charitably taken into the house to educate her | emilius's friends could not conceive why he lived in this narrow street in this comfortless lodging why he was so little to be seen in society or how he employed himself | without employment in solitude he was happy: only he felt angry with himself and his own timidity and shyness which kept him from venturing to seek a nearer acquaintance with this fair being notwithstanding the friendliness with which on many occasions she had greeted and thanked him | he knew not that she would often bend over him eyes no less love sick than his own nor boded what wishes were forming in her heart of what an effort of what a sacrifice she felt herself capable so she might but attain to the possession of his love | after walking a few times up and down the room when the light had departed with the child he suddenly resolved upon going to the ball though it was so against his inclination and his nature for it struck him that his unknown might have made an exception to her quiet mode of life in order for once to enjoy the world and its gaieties | the streets were brilliantly lighted up the snow crackled under his feet carriages rolled by and masks in every variety of dress whistled and chirped as they passed him | from many a house there sounded the dancing music he so abhorred and he could not bring himself to go the nearest way towards the ball room whither people from every direction were streaming and thronging | he walked round the old church gazed at its lofty tower rising solemnly into the dark sky and felt gladdened by the stillness and loneliness of the remote square | within the recess of a large door way the varied sculptures of which he had always contemplated with pleasure recollecting while so engaged the olden times and the arts which adorned them he now again paused to give himself up for a few moments to his thoughts | he had not stood long before a figure drew his attention which kept restlessly walking to and fro and seemed to be waiting for somebody | by the light of a lamp that was burning before an image of the virgin he clearly distinguished its features as well as its strange garb | it was an old woman of the uttermost hideousness which struck the eye the more from being brought out by its extravagant contrast with a scarlet bodice embroidered with gold the gown she wore was dark and the cap on her head shone likewise with gold | emilius fancied at first it must be some tasteless mask that had strayed there by mistake but he was soon convinced by the clear light that the old brown wrinkled face was one of nature's ploughing and no mimic exaggeration | many minutes had not passed when there appeared two men wrapped up in cloaks who seemed to approach the spot with cautions footsteps often looking about them as if to observe whether anybody was following | the old woman walked up to them | 'have you got the candles '| asked she hastily and with a gruff voice | 'here they are ' said one of the men 'you know the price let the matter be settled forthwith '| the old woman seemed to be giving him money which he counted over beneath his cloak | 'i rely upon you ' she again began 'that they are made exactly according to the prescription at the right time and place so that the work cannot fail '| 'feel safe as to that ' returned the man and walked rapidly away | the other who remained behind was a youth: he took the old woman by the hand and said: 'can it then be alexia that such rites and forms of words as those old stories in which i never could put faith tell us can fetter the free will of man and make love and hatred grow in the heart '| 'so it is ' answered the scarlet woman 'but one and one must make two and many a one must be added thereto before such things come to pass | it is not these candles alone moulded beneath the midnight darkness of the new moon and drenched with human blood it is not the muttering magical words and invocations alone that can give you the mastery over the soul of another much more than this belongs to such works but it is all known to the initiated '| 'i rely on you then ' said the stranger | 'to morrow after midnight i am at your service ' returned the old woman | 'you shall not be the first person that ever was dissatisfied with the tidings i brought him | to night as you have heard i have some one else in hand one whose senses and understanding our art shall twist about whichever way we choose as easily as i twist this hair out of my head '| these last words she uttered with a half grin: they now separated and withdrew in different directions | emilius came from the dark niche shuddering and raised his looks upon the image of the virgin with the child | 'before thine eyes thou mild and blessed one ' said he half aloud 'are these miscreants daring to hold their market and trafficking in their hellish drugs | but as thou embracest thy child with thy love even so doth the unseen love hold us all in its protecting arms and we feel their touch and our poor hearts beat in joy and in trembling toward a greater heart that will never forsake us '| clouds were wandering along over the pinnacles of the tower and the steep roof of the church the everlasting stars looked down from amongst them sparkling with mild serenity and emilius turned his thoughts resolutely away from these nightly horrors and thought upon the beauty of his unknown | he again entered the living streets and bent his steps toward the brightly illuminated ball room whence voices and the rattling of carriages and now and then between the pauses the clamorous music came sounding to his ears | in the hall he was instantly lost amid the streaming throng dancers sprang round him masks shot by him to and fro kettle drums and trumpets deafened his ears and it was unto him as though human life were nothing but a dream | he walked along the lines his eye alone was watchful seeking for those beloved eyes and that fair head with its brown locks for the sight of which he yearned to day even more intensely than at other times and yet he inwardly reproached the adored being for enduring to plunge into and lose itself in such a stormy sea of confusion and folly | 'no ' said he to himself 'no heart that loves can lay itself open to this waste hubbub of noise in which every longing and every tear of love is scoffed and mocked at by the pealing laughter of wild trumpets | the whispering of trees the murmuring of fountains harp tones and gentle song gushing forth from an overflowing bosom are the sounds in which love abides | but this is the very thundering and shouting of hell in the trance of its despair '| he found not what he was seeking for the belief that her beloved face might perchance be lying hid behind some odious mask was what he could not possibly bring himself to | thrice already had he ranged up and down the hall and had vainly passed in array every sitting and unmasked female when the spaniard joined him and said: 'i am glad that after all you are come | you seem to be looking for your friend '| emilius had quite forgotten him: he said however in some confusion: 'indeed i wonder at not having met him here his mask is easily known '| 'can you guess what the strange fellow is about '| answered the young officer | 'he did not dance or even remain half an hour in the ball room for he soon met with his friend anderson who is just come from the country | their conversation fell upon literature | as anderson had not yet seen the new poem roderick would not rest till they had opened one of the back rooms for him and there he now is sitting with his companion beside a solitary taper and declaiming the whole poem to him beginning with the invocation to the muse '| 'it is just like him ' said emilius 'he is always the child of the moment | i have done all in my power not even shunning some amicable quarrels to break him of this habit of always living extempore and playing away his whole being in impromptus card after card as it happens to turn up without once looking through his hand | but these follies have taken such deep root in his heart he would sooner part with his best friend than with them | that very same poem of which he is so fond that he always carries a copy of it in his pocket he was desirous of reading to me and i had even urgently entreated him to do so but we were scarcely over the first description of the moon when just as i was resigning myself to an enjoyment of its beauties he suddenly jumped up ran off came back with the cook's apron round his waist tore down the bell rope in ringing to have the fire lighted and insisted on dressing me some beef steaks for which i had not the least appetite and of which he fancies himself the best cook in europe though if he is lucky he spoils them only nine times out of ten '| the spaniard laughed and asked: 'has he never been in love '| 'in his way ' replied emilius very gravely 'as if he were making game both of love and of himself with a dozen women at a time and if you would believe his words raving after every one of them but ere a week passes over his head they are all sponged out of it together and not even a blot of them remains '| they parted in the crowd and emilius walked toward the remote apartment whence already from afar he heard his friend's loud recitative | 'ah so you are here too ' cried roderick as he entered 'that is just what it should be | i have got to the very passage at which we broke down the other day seat yourself and you may listen to the rest '| 'i am not in a humour for it now ' said emilius 'besides the room and the hour do not seem to me altogether fitted for such an employment '| 'and why not '| answered roderick | 'time and place are made for us and not we for time and place | is not good poetry as good at one place as at another | or would you prefer dancing | there is scarcity of men and with the help of nothing more than a few hours' jumping and a pair of tired legs you may lay strong siege to the hearts of as many grateful beauties as you please '| 'good bye '| cried the other already in the door way 'i am going home '| roderick called after him: 'only one word | i set off with this gentleman at daybreak to morrow to spend a few days in the country but will look in upon you to take leave before we start | should you be asleep as is most likely do not take the trouble of waking for in a couple of days i shall be with you again the strangest being on earth '| he continued turning to his new friend 'so moping and fretful and gloomy that he turns all his pleasures sour or rather there is no such thing as pleasure for him | instead of walking about with his fellow creatures in broad daylight and enjoying himself he gets down to the bottom of the well of his thoughts for the sake of now and then having a glimpse of a star | everything must be in the superlative for him everything must be pure and noble and celestial his heart must be always heaving and throbbing even when he is standing before a puppet show | he never laughs or cries but can only smile and weep and there is mighty little difference between his weeping and his smiling | when anything be it what you will falls short of his anticipations and preconceptions which are always flying up out of reach and sight he puts on a tragical face and complains that it is a base and soulless world | at this moment i doubt not he is exacting that under the masks of a pantaloon and a pulcinello there should be a heart glowing with unearthly desires and ideal aspirations and that harlequin should out moralise hamlet upon the nothingness of sublunary things and should it not be so the dew will rise into his eyes and he will turn his back on the whole scene with desponding contempt '| 'he must be melancholic then '| asked his hearer | 'not that exactly ' answered roderick | 'he has only been spoilt by his over fond parents and by himself | he has accustomed himself to let his heart ebb and flow as regularly as the sea and if this motion ever chances to intermit he cries out miracle | and would offer a prize to the genius that can satisfactorily explain so marvellous a phenomenon | he is the best fellow under the sun but all my painstaking to break him of this perverseness is utterly vain and thrown away and if i would not earn sorry thanks for my good intentions i must even let him follow his own course '| 'he seems to need a physician ' remarked anderson | 'it is one of his whims ' said roderick 'to entertain a supreme contempt for the whole medical art | he will have it that every disease is something different and distinct in every patient that it can be brought under no class and that it is absurd to think of healing it either by attention to ancient practice or by what is called theory | indeed he would much rather apply to an old woman and make use of sympathetic cures | on the same principle he despises all foresight on whatever occasion as well as everything like regularity moderation and common sense | the last above all he holds in especial abhorrence as the antipodes and arch enemy of all enthusiasm | from his very childhood he framed for himself an ideal of a noble character and his highest aim is to render himself what he considers such that is a being who shows his superiority to all things earthy by his contempt for gold | merely in order that he may not be suspected of being parsimonious or giving unwillingly or ever talking about money he tosses it about him right and left by handfuls with all his large income is for ever poor and distressed and becomes the fool of everybody not endowed with precisely the same kind of magnanimity which for himself he is determined that he will have | to be his friend is the undertaking of all undertakings for he is so irritable one need only cough or eat with one's knife or even pick one's teeth to offend him mortally '| 'was he never in love '| asked his country friend | 'whom should he love | whom could he love '| answered roderick | 'he scorns all the daughters of earth and were he ever to suspect that his beloved had not an angelical contempt for dress or liked dancing as well as star gazing it would break his heart still more appalling would it be if she were ever so unfortunate as to sneeze '| meanwhile emilius was again standing amid the throng but suddenly there came over him that uneasiness that shivering which had already so often seized his heart when among a crowd in a state of similar excitement it chased him out of the ball room and house down along the deserted streets nor till he reached his lonely chamber did he recover himself and the quiet possession of his senses | the night light was already kindled he sent his servant to bed everything in the opposite house was silent and dark and he sat down to pour forth in verse the feelings which had been aroused by the ball | within the heart 'tis still sleep each wild thought encages now stirs a wicked will would see how madness rages | and cries wild spirit awake | loud cymbals catch the cry and back its echoes shake and shouting peals of laughter the trumpet rushes after and cries wild spirit awake | amidst them flute tones fly like arrows keen and numberless and with bloodhound yell pipes the onset swell and violins and violoncellos creeking clattering shrieking and shattering and horns whence thunder bellows to leave the victim slumberless and drag forth prisoned madness and cruelly murder all quiet and innocent gladness | what will be the end of this commotion | where the shore to this turmoiling ocean | what seeks the tossing throng as it wheels and whirls along |on on  the lustres like hell stars bicker: let us twine in closer clusters |on on  ever thicker and quicker | how the silly things throb throb amain | hence all quiet | hither riot | peal more proudly squeal more loudly ye cymbals ye trumpets | be dull all pain till it laugh again | thou becomest to me beauty's daughter smiles ripple over thy lips and o'er thine eyes blue water o let me breathe on thee ere parted hence we flee | ere aught that light eclipse | i know that beauty's flowers soon wither those lips within whose rosy cells thy spirit warbles its sweet spells death's clammy kiss ere long will press together | i know that face so fair and full is but a masquerading skull but hail to thee skull so fair and so fresh | why should i weep and whine and wail that what blooms now must soon grow pale that worms must feed on that sweet flesh | let me laugh but to day and to morrow and i care not for sorrow while thus on the waves of the dance by each other we sail | now thou art mine and i am thine: and what though pain and sorrow wait to seize thee at the gate and sob and tear and groan and sigh stand ranged in state on thee to fly blithely let us look and cheerily on death that grins so drearily | what would grief with us or anguish | they are foes that we know how to vanquish | i press thine answering fingers thy look upon me lingers or the fringe of thy garment will waft me a kiss: thou rollest on in light i fall back into night even despair is bliss | from this delight from this wild laughter's surge perchance there may emerge foul jealousy and scorn and spite | but this our glory | and pride | when thee i despise i turn but mine eyes and the fair one beside thee will welcome my gaze and she is my bride oh happy happy days | or shall it be her neighbour whose eyes like a sabre flash and pierce their glance is so fierce | thus capering and prancing all together go dancing adown life's giddy cave nor living nor loving but dizzily roving through dreams to a grave | there below 'tis yet worse its flowers and its clay roof a gloomier day hide a still deeper curse | ring then ye cymbals enliven this dream | ye horns shout a fiercer more vulture like scream | and jump caper leap prance dance yourselves out of breath | for your life is all art love has given you no heart: therefore shout till ye plunge into bottomless death | he had ended and was standing at the window | then came she into the opposite chamber lovely as he had never yet seen her her brown hair floated freely and played in wanton ringlets about the whitest of necks she was but lightly clad and it seemed as though she was about to finish some household task at this late hour of the night before going to bed for she placed two lights in two corners of the room set to rights the green baize on the table and again retired | emilius was still sunk in his sweet dreams and gazing on the image which his beloved had left on his mind when to his horror the fearful the scarlet old woman walked through the chamber the gold on her head and breast glared ghastlily as it threw back the light | she had vanished again | was he to believe his eyes | was it not some blinding deception of the night some spectre that his own feverish imagination had conjured up before him | but no | she returned still more hideous than before with a long gray and black mane flying wildly and ruggedly about her breast and back | the fair maiden followed her pale frozen up her lovely bosom was without a covering but the whole form was like a marble statue | betwixt them they led the little sweet child weeping and clinging entreatingly to the fair maiden who looked not down upon it | the child clasped and lifted up its little beseeching hands and stroked the pale neck and cheeks of the marble beauty | but she held it fast by the hair and in the other hand a silver basin | then the old woman gave a growl and pulled out a long knife and drew it across the white neck of the child | here something wound forth from behind them which they seemed not to perceive or it must have produced in them the same deep horror as in emilius | the ghastly neck of a serpent curled forth scale after scale lengthening and ever lengthening out of the darkness and stooped down between them over the child whose lifeless limbs hung from the old woman's arms its black tongue licked up the spirting red blood and a green sparkling eye shot over into emilius's eye and brain and heart so that he fell at the same instant to the ground | he was senseless when found by roderick some hours after |  a party of friends was sitting on the brightest summer morning in a green arbour assembled round an excellent breakfast | laughter and jests passed round and many a time did the glasses kiss with a merry health to the youthful couple and a wish that they might be the happiest of the happy | the bride and bridegroom were not present the fair one being still busied about her dress while the young husband was sauntering alone in a distant avenue musing upon his happiness | 'what a pity ' said anderson 'that we are to have no music | all our ladies are beclouded at the thought and never in their whole lives longed for a dance so much as to day when to have one is quite out of the question | it is far too painful to his feelings '| 'i can tell you a secret though ' said a young officer 'which is that we are to have a dance after all and a rare madcap and riotous one it will he | everything is already arranged the musicians are come secretly and quartered out of sight | roderick has managed it all for he says one ought not to let him have his own way or to humour his strange prejudices over much especially on such a day as this | besides he is already grown far more like a human being and is much more sociable than he used to be so that i think even he will not dislike this alteration | indeed the whole wedding has been brought about all of a sudden in a way that nobody could have expected '| 'his whole life ' said anderson 'is no less singular than his character | you must all remember how being engaged on his travels he arrived last autumn in our city fixed himself there for the winter lived like a melancholy man scarcely ever leaving his room and never gave himself the least trouble about our theatre or any other amusement | he almost quarrelled with roderick his most intimate friend for trying to divert him and not pampering him in all his moping humours | in fact this exaggerated irritability and moodiness must have been a disease that was gathering in his body for as you know he was seized four months since with a most violent nervous fever so that we were all forced to give him up for lost | after his fancies had raved themselves out on returning to his senses he had almost entirely lost his memory his childhood indeed and his early youth were still present to his mind but he could not recollect anything that had occurred during his travels or immediately before his illness | he was forced to begin anew his acquaintance with all his friends even with roderick and only by little and little has it grown lighter with him but slowly has the past with all that had befallen him come again though still in dim colours over his memory | he had been removed into his uncle's house that the better care might be taken of him and he was like a child letting them do with him whatever they chose | the first time he went out to enjoy the warmth of spring in the park he saw a girl sitting thoughtfully by the road side | she looked up her eye met his and as it were seized with an unaccountable yearning he bade the carriage stop got out sat down by her took hold of her hands and poured himself forth in a full stream of tears | his friends were again alarmed for his understanding but he grew tranquil lively and conversable got introduced to the girl's parents and at the very first besought her hand which as her parents did not refuse their consent she granted him | thenceforward he was happy and a new life sprang up within him every day he became healthier and more cheerful | a week ago he visited me at this country seat of mine and was above measure delighted with it indeed so much so that he would not rest till he had made me sell it to him | i might easily have turned his passionate wish to my own good account and to his injury for whenever he sets his heart on a thing he will have it and that forthwith | he immediately made his arrangements and had furniture brought hither that he may spend the summer months here and in this way it has come to pass that we are all now assembled together to celebrate our friend's marriage at this villa which a few days since belonged to me '| the house was large and situated in a very lovely country | one side looked down upon a river and beyond it upon pleasant hills clad and girt round with shrubs and trees of various kinds immediately before it lay a beautiful flower garden | here the orange and lemon trees were ranged in a large open hall from which small doors led to the store rooms and cellars and pantries | on the other side spread the green plain of a meadow which was immediately bordered by a large park here the two long wings of the house formed a spacious court and three broad open galleries supported by rows of pillars standing above each other connected all the apartments in the building which gave it on this side an interesting and singular character for figures were continually moving along these arcades in the discharge of their various household tasks new forms kept stepping forth between the pillars and out of every room which reappeared soon after above or below to be lost behind some other doors the company too would often assemble there for tea or for play and thus when seen from below the whole had the look of a theatre before which everybody would gladly pause awhile expecting as his fancies wandered that something strange or pleasing would soon be taking place above | the party of young people were just rising when the full dressed bride came through the garden and walked up to them | she was clad in violet coloured velvet a sparkling necklace lay cradled on her white neck the costly lace just allowed her swelling bosom to glimmer through her brown hair was tinged yet more beautifully by its wreath of myrtles and white roses | she addressed each in turn with a kind greeting and the young men were astonished at her surpassing beauty | she had been gathering flowers in the garden and was now returning into the house to see after the preparations for the dinner | the tables had been placed in the lower open gallery and shone dazzlingly with their white coverings and their load of sparkling crystal rich clusters of many coloured flowers rose from the graceful necks of alabaster vases green garlands starred with white blossoms twined round the columns and it was a lovely sight to behold the bride gliding along with gentle motion between the tables and the pillars amid the light of the flowers overlooking the whole with a searching glance then vanishing and re appearing a moment afterwards higher up to pass into her chamber | 'she is the loveliest and most enchanting creature i ever saw ' cried anderson 'our friend is indeed the happiest of men '| 'even her paleness ' said the officer taking up the word 'heightens her beauty | her brown eyes sparkle only more intensely above those white cheeks and beneath those dark locks and the singular almost burning redness of her lips gives a truly magical appearance to her face '| 'the air of silent melancholy that surrounds her ' said anderson 'sheds a lofty majesty over her whole form '| the bridegroom joined them and inquired after roderick | they had all missed him some time since and could not conceive where he could be tarrying and they all set out in search of him | 'he is below in the hall ' said at length a young man whom they happened to ask 'in the midst of the coachmen footmen and grooms showing off tricks at cards which they cannot grow tired of staring at '| they went in and interrupted the noisy admiration of the servants without however disturbing roderick who quietly pursued his conjuring exhibition | when he had finished he walked with the others into the garden and said 'i do it only to strengthen the fellows in their faith: for these puzzles give a hard blow to their groomships' free thinking inclinations and help to make them true believers '| 'i see ' said the bridegroom 'my all sufficing friend among his other talents does not think that of a mountebank beneath his cultivation '| 'we live in a strange time ' replied the other | 'who knows whether mountebanks may not come to rule the roost in their turn | one ought to despise nothing nowadays: the veriest straw of talent may be that which is to break the camel's back '| when the two friends found themselves alone emilius again turned down the dark avenue and said 'why am i in such a gloomy mood on this the happiest day of my life | but i assure you roderick little as you will believe it i am not made for this moving about among such a mob of human beings for this keeping my attention on the qui vive for every letter of the alphabet so that neither a nor z may go without all fitting respect for this making a bow to her tenth and shaking hands with my twentieth for this rendering of formal homage to her parents for this handing a flower from my nosegay of compliments to every lady that crosses my eye for this waiting to receive the tide of newcomers as wave after wave rushes over me and then turning to give orders that their servants and horses may have each a full trough and pail set before them '| 'that is a watch that goes of its own accord ' answered roderick | 'only look at your house it was just built for such an occasion and your head butler with his right hand taking up at the same time that his left is setting down and one leg running north while the other seems to be making for south was begotten and born for no other end than to put confusion in order | he would even set my brains to rights if he could get at them were the whole city here he would find room for all and he will make your hospitality the proverb of fifty miles round | leave all such things to him and to your lovely bride and where will you find so sweet a lightener of this world's cares '| 'this morning before sunrise ' said emilius 'i was walking through the wood my thoughts were solemnly tuned and i felt to the bottom of my soul that my life was now receiving its determinate character that it was become a serious thing and that this passion had created for me a home and a calling | i passed along by that arbour there and heard sounds: it was my beloved in close conversation |  has it not turned out now as i told you | said a strange voice just as i knew it must turn out | you have got your wish so cheer up and be merry | i would not go near them afterwards i walked toward the arbour but they had both already left it | since then i keep thinking and thinking what can these words mean '| roderick answered: 'perhaps she may have been in love with you for some time without your knowing it you are only so much the happier '| a late nightingale here upraised her song and seemed to be wishing the lover health and bliss | emilius became more thoughtful | 'come down with me to cheer up your spirits ' said roderick 'down to the village where you will find another couple for you must not fancy that yours is the only wedding on which to day's sun is to shine | a young clown finding his time wear heavily in the house with an ugly old maid for want of something better to do did what makes the booby now think himself bound in honour to transform her into his wife | by this time they must both be already dressed so let us not miss the sight for doubtless it will be a most interesting wedding '| the melancholy man let himself be dragged along by his lively chattering friend and they soon came to the cottage | the procession was just sallying forth to go to the church | the young countryman was in his usual linen frock all his finery consisted in a pair of leather breeches which he had polished till they shone like a field of dandelions he was of simple mien and appeared somewhat confused | the bride was sun burnt with but a few farewell leaves of youth still hanging about her she was coarsely and poorly but cleanly dressed some red and blue silk ribbons already a good deal faded but what chiefly disfigured her was that her hair stiffened with lard flour and pins had been swept back from her forehead and piled up at the top of her head in a mound on the summit of which lay the bridal chaplet | she smiled and seemed glad at heart but was shamefaced and downcast | next came the aged parents the father too was only a servant about the farm and the hovel the furniture and the clothing all bore witness that their poverty was extreme | a dirty squinting musician followed the train who kept grinning and screaming and scratching his fiddle which was patched together of wood and pasteboard and instead of strings had three bits of pack thread | the procession halted when his honour their new master came up to them | some mischief loving servants young lads and girls tittered and laughed and jeered the bridal couple especially the ladies' maids who thought themselves far handsomer and saw themselves infinitely better clad and wondered how people could be so vulgar | a shuddering came over emilius he looked round for roderick but the latter had already run away from him again | an impertinent coxcomb with a head pilloried in his high starched neck cloth a servant to one of the visitors eager to show his wit pressed up to emilius giggling and cried: 'now your honour what says your honour to this grand couple | they can neither of them guess where they are to find bread for to morrow and yet they mean to give a ball this afternoon and that famous performer there is already engaged '| 'no bread '| said emilius 'can such things be '| 'their wretchedness ' continued the chatterbox 'is known to the whole neighbourhood but the fellow says he bears the creature the same good will although she is such a sorry bit of clay | ay verily as the song says love can make black white | the couple of baggages have not even a bed and must pass their wedding night on the straw | they have just been round to every house begging a pint of small beer with which they mean to get drunk a royal treat for a wedding day your honour '| everybody round about laughed loudly and the unhappy despised pair cast down their eyes | emilius indignantly pushed the chatterer away | 'here take this '| he cried and threw a hundred ducats which he had received that morning into the hands of the amazed bridegroom | the betrothed couple and their parents wept aloud threw themselves clumsily on their knees and kissed his hands and the skirts of his coat | he tried to make his escape | 'let that keep hunger out of your doors as long as it lasts '| he exclaimed quite stunned by his feelings | 'oh '| they all screamed 'oh your honour | we shall be rich and happy till the day of our deaths and longer too if we live longer '| he knew not how he got away from them but he found himself alone and hastened with unsteady steps into the wood | here he sought out the thickest loneliest spot and threw himself down on a grassy knoll no longer keeping back the bursting stream of his tears | 'i am sick of life ' he sobbed 'i cannot be glad and happy i will not | make haste and receive me thou dear kind earth and hide me in thy cool refreshing arms from the wild beasts that tread over thee and call themselves men | oh god in heaven | how have i deserved that i should rest upon down and wear silk that the grape should pour forth her most precious blood for me and that all should throng around me and offer me their homage and love | this poor wretch is better and worthier than i and misery is his nurse and mockery and venomous scorn are the only sounds that hail his wedding | every delicacy that is placed before me every draught out of my costly goblets my lying on soft beds my wearing gold and rich garments will be unto me like so many sins now that i have beheld how the world hunts down many thousand thousand wretches who are hungering after the dry bread that i throw away and who never know what a good meal is | oh now i can fully understand your feelings ye holy pious whom the world despises and scorns and scoffs at who scatter abroad your all even unto the raiment of your poverty and did gird sack cloth about your loins and did resolve as beggars to endure the gibes and the kicks wherewith brutal insolence and swilling voluptuousness drive away misery from their tables that by so doing ye might thoroughly purge yourselves from the foul sin of wealth '| the world with all its forms of being hung in a mist before his eyes he determined to look upon the destitute as his brethren and to depart far away from the communion of the happy | they had already been waiting for him a long time in the hall to perform the ceremony the bride had become uneasy her parents had gone in search of him through the garden and park at length he returned lighter for having wept away his cares and the solemn knot was tied | the company then walked from the lower hall toward the open gallery to seat themselves at table | the bride and bridegroom led the way and the rest followed in their train | roderick offered his arm to a young girl who was gay and talkative | 'why does a bride always cry and look so sad and serious during the ceremony ' said she as they mounted the steps | 'because it is the first moment in which she feels intensely all the weight and meaning and mystery of life ' answered roderick | 'but our bride ' continued the girl 'far surpasses in gravity all i have ever yet seen | indeed she almost always looks melancholy and one can never catch her in a downright hearty laugh '| 'this does more honour to her heart ' answered roderick himself contrary to custom feeling somewhat seriously disposed | 'you know not perhaps that the bride a few years ago took a lovely little orphan girl into the house to educate her | all her time was devoted to the child and the love of this gentle being was her sweetest reward | the girl was become seven years old when she was lost during a walk through the town and in spite of all the means that have been employed nobody could ever find out what became of her | our noble minded hostess has taken this misfortune so much to heart that she has been preyed upon ever since by a silent melancholy nor can anything win her away from her longing after her little play fellow '| 'a most interesting adventure indeed ' said the lady | 'one might see a whole romance in three volumes grow out of this seed | it will be a strange sight and it will not be for nothing when this lost star reappears | what a pretty poem it would make | don't you think so sir '| the party arranged themselves at table | the bride and bridegroom sat in the centre and looked out upon the gay landscape | they talked and drank healths and the most cheerful humour reigned the bride's parents were quite happy the bridegroom alone was reserved and thoughtful eat but little and took no part in the conversation | he started when some musical sounds rolled down from above but grew calm again on finding it was nothing but the soft notes of a bugle which wandered along with a pleasant murmur over the shrubs and through the park till they died away on the distant hills | roderick had stationed the musicians in the gallery overhead and emilius was satisfied with this arrangement | toward the end of the dinner he called his butler and turning to his bride said 'my love let poverty also have a share of our superfluities '| he then ordered him to send several bottles of wine some pastry and other dishes in abundant portions to the poor couple so that with them also this day might be a day of rejoicing unto which in after times they might look back with delight | 'see my friend ' cried roderick 'how beautifully all things in this world hang together | my idle trick of busying myself about other people's concerns and my chattering though you are for ever finding fault with them have after all been the occasion of this good deed '| several persons began making pretty speeches to their host on his compassion and kind heart and the young lady next to roderick lisped about romantic feelings and sentimental magnanimity | 'o hold your tongues ' cried emilius indignantly | 'this is no good action it is no action at all it is nothing | when swallows and linnets feed themselves with the crumbs that are thrown away from the waste of this meal and carry them to their young ones in their nests shall not i remember a poor brother who needs my help | if i durst follow my heart ye would laugh and jeer at me just as ye have laughed and jeered at many others who have gone forth into the wilderness that they might hear no more of this world and its generosity '| everybody was silent and roderick perceiving the most vehement displeasure in his friend's glowing eyes feared he might forget himself still more in his present ungracious mood and tried to give the conversation a sudden turn upon other subjects | but emilius was becoming restless and absent his eyes were continually wandering toward the upper gallery where the servants who lived in the top story had many things to do | 'who is that ugly old woman ' he at length asked 'that is so busy there going backwards and forwards in her gray cloak '| 'she is one of my attendants ' said his bride 'she is to overlook and manage my waiting maids and the other girls '| 'how can you bear to have anything so hideous always at your elbow '| replied emilius | 'let her alone ' answered the young lady 'god meant the ugly to live as well as the handsome: and she is such a good honest creature she may be of great use to us '| on rising from table everybody pressed round the new husband again wished him joy and urgently begged that he would consent to their having a ball | the bride too said breathing a gentle kiss on his forehead: 'you will not deny your wife's first request my beloved we have all been looking forward with delight to this moment | it is so long since i danced last and you have never yet seen me dance | have you no curiosity how i shall acquit myself in this new character | my mother tells me i look better than at any other time '| 'i never saw you thus cheerful ' said emilius 'i will be no disturber of your joys: do just what you please only let me bargain for nobody asking me to make myself ridiculous by any clumsy capers '| 'oh if you are a bad dancer ' she answered laughing 'you may feel quite safe everybody will readily consent to your sitting still '| the bride then retired to put on her ball dress | 'she does not know ' said emilius to roderick with whom he withdrew 'that i can pass from the next room into hers through a secret door i will surprise her while she is dressing '| when emilius had left them and many of the ladies were also gone to make such changes in their attire as were necessary for the ball roderick took the young men aside and led the way to his own room | 'it is wearing toward evening ' said he 'and will soon be dark so make haste every one of you and mask yourselves that we may render this night glorious in the annals of merriment and madness | give your fancies free range in choosing your characters: the wilder and uglier the better | try every combination of shaggy mane and squinting eye and mouth like a gaping volcano build mountains upon your shoulders or fatten yourselves into falstaffs and as a whet to your inventions i hereby promise a kiss from the bride to the figure that would be the likeliest to make her miscarry | a wedding is such a strange event in one's life the bride and bridegroom are so suddenly plunged as it were by magic head over heels into a new unaccustomed element that it is impossible to infuse too much of madness and folly into this feast in order to keep pace with the whirlpool that is bearing a brace of human beings from the state in which they were two into the state in which they become one and to let all things round about them be fit accompaniments for the dizzy dream on the wings of which they are floating toward a new life | so let us rave away the night making all sail before the breeze and a fig for such as look twice on the grave sour faces that would have you behave rationally '| 'don't be afraid ' said the young officer 'we have brought from town with us a large chest full of masks and mad carnival dresses such as would make even you stare '| 'but see here ' returned roderick 'what a gem i have got from my tailor who was just going to cut up this peerless robe into strips | he bought it of an old crone who must doubtless have worn it on gala days when she went to lucifer's drawing room on the blocksberg | look at this scarlet bodice with its gold tassels and fringe at this cap besmeared with the last fee the hag got from beelzebub or his imps: it will give me a right worshipful air | to match such jewels there is this green velvet petticoat with its saffron coloured trimming and this mask would melt even medusa to a grin | thus accoutred i mean to lead the chorus of graces myself their mother queen toward the bed chamber | make all the haste you can and we will then go in procession to fetch the bride '| the bugles were still playing the company were walking about the garden or sitting before the house | the sun had gone down behind thick murky clouds and the country was lying in the gray dusk when a parting gleam suddenly burst forth athwart the cloudy veil and flooded every spot around but especially the building and its galleries and pillars and wreaths of flowers as it were with red blood | at this moment the parents of the bride and the other spectators beheld a train of the wildest appearances move toward the upper corridor | roderick led the way as the scarlet old woman and was followed by hump backs mountain paunches massy wigs clowns punches skeleton like pantaloons female figures embanked by enormous hoops and over canopied with three feet of horsehair powder and pomatum and by every disgusting shape that can be conceived as though a nightmare were unrolling her stores | they jumped and twirled and tottered and stumbled and straddled and strutted and swaggered along the gallery and then vanished behind one of the doors | but few of the beholders had been able to laugh: so utterly were they amazed by the strange sight | suddenly a piercing shriek burst from one of the rooms and there rushed forth into the blood red glow of the sunset the pale bride in a short white frock round which wreaths of flowers were waving with her lovely bosom all uncovered and her rich locks streaming through the air | as though mad with rolling eyes and distorted face she darted along the gallery and blinded by terror could find neither door nor staircase and immediately after rushed emilius in chase of her with the sparkling turkish dagger in his high upraised hand | now she was at the end of the passage she could go no further he reached her | his masked friends and the gray old woman were running after him | but he had already furiously pierced her bosom and cut through her white neck her blood spouted forth into the radiance of the setting sun | the old woman had clasped round him to tear him back he struggled with her and hurled himself together with her over the railing and they both fell almost lifeless down at the feet of the relations who had been staring in dumb horror at the bloody scene | above and below or hastening down the stairs and along the galleries were seen the hideous masks standing or running about in various clusters like fiends of hell | roderick took his dying friend in his arms | he had found him in his wife's room playing with the dagger | she was almost dressed when he entered | at the sight of the hated red bodice his memory had rekindled the horrible vision of the night had risen upon his mind and gnashing his teeth he had sprung after his trembling flying bride to avenge that murder and all those devilish doings | the old woman ere she expired confessed the crime that had been wrought and the gladness and mirth of the whole house were suddenly changed into sorrow and lamentation and dismay | ludwig tieck | the author of the foregoing tale ludwig tieck has lately been introduced to the english reader by an admirable translation of his two exquisite little novels the pictures and the betrothing | he is one among the great german writers who made their appearance during the last ten years of the eighteenth century a period whether from any extraordinary productiveness in the power that regulates the seed time and the harvests of the human race or from the mighty excitements and stimulants wherewith the world was then teeming among the richest in the blossoming of genius | for not to mention the great military talents first developed in those days among the holders of which were he who conquered all the continent of europe and he before whom that conqueror fell turning away from the many rank but luxuriant weeds that sprang up in france after all its plains had been manured with blood and fixing the eye solely upon literary excellence we find in our own country that the chief part of those men by whom we may hope that the memory of our days will be transmitted to posterity as a thing precious and to be held in honour that wordsworth and coleridge and southey and lamb and landor and scott put forth during those ten years the first fruits of their minds while in germany the same period was rendered illustrious by fichte and john paul richter at its commencement and subsequently by schelling and hegel and steffens schleiermacher and the schlegels and novalis and tieck | of this noble brotherhood who all i believe studied at the same university that of jena and who were all bound together by friendship by affinity of genius and by unity of aim the two latter novalis and tieck were the poets: for though there are several things of great poetical beauty in the works of the schlegels their fame upon the whole rests on a different basis | the lovely dreamy mind of novalis was cut off in the full promise of its spring it only just awoke from the blissful visions of its childhood to breathe forth a few lyrical murmurs about the mysteries it had been brooding over and then fell asleep again | upon tieck therefore the character of german poetry in the age following those of goethe and schiller will mainly depend: and never did norwegian or icelandic spring burst forth more suddenly than the youth of ludwig tieck | i know not in the whole history of literature any poet who can count up so many and so great exploits achieved on his first descent into the arena: in number and variety even goethe must yield the precedence though his youthful triumphs were goetz of berlichingen and werther | there was in tieck's early works the promise and far more than the promise of the greatest dramatic poet whom europe had seen since the days of calderon there was a rich elastic buoyant comic spirit not like the analytical reflection keen biting wit of moli re and congreve and other comic writers of the satirical school but like the living merriment the uncontrollable exuberant joyousness the humour arising from good humour not as it often does from ill humour the incarnation so to say of the principle of mirth in shakespeare and cervantes and aristophanes and as a wreath of flowers to crown the whole there was the heavenly purity and starlike loveliness of his genoveva | had the rest of tieck's life kept pace with the fertility of the six years from 1798 to 1804 he must have been beyond all rivalry the second of german poets and as eschylus in the frogs shares his supremacy with sophocles so would goethe have invited tieck to sit beside him on his throne | unfortunately for those who would have feasted upon his fruits the poet during the last twenty years has been so weighed down by almost unintermitting ill health that he has published but little | there was a short interval indeed that seemed to bid fairer about the year 1812 when he began to collect his tales and lesser dramas on a plan something like that of the decameron in the phantasm but it has not yet been carried beyond the second reign out of seven through which it was designed to extend | of that collection the chief part had been known to the world ten or twelve years before: some things however appeared then for the first time and among them i believe was the tale of the love charm | latterly tieck's genius has taken a new spring in a somewhat different direction from that of his youth | he has written half a dozen novels in the manner of the couple recently translated nor are the others of less excellence than those two a beautiful tale of magic has also been just published and the speedy appearance of several other things that have employed him during the long period of seeming inactivity is promised wherein he has been engaged more or less for above a quarter of a century and to gather materials for which he some years since visited england | of this work the highest expectations may justly be formed: not many people even in this country possess a more extensive and accurate acquaintance with our ancient drama than tieck no one has entered more fully into the spirit of its great poets than tieck has shown himself to have done in the prefaces to his old english theatre and his shakespeare's vorschule few have ever bestowed such attention on the history of the stage in all countries or have so studied the principles of dramatic composition and the nature of dramatic effect hardly any one i may say no one ever learnt so much from shakespeare: no one therefore can have more to teach us about him and to judge from the remarks on some of the plays which have already been printed in the abendzeitung no one was ever so able to trace out the most secret workings of the great master's mind or to retain his full calm self possession when following him on his highest flights no one ever united in such perfection the great critic with the great poet | the wine flows heavily in our people more miserable | hens animated by a sacred fire would have said that lay eggs cooked and everything | the lambs are born roasts | spain eats and drinks at home | what are the socialists who criticize mr maura by the spanish people take on this blessing of a general election | as the decree of dissolution is delayed a few months more and how expensive is the life spain will starve | it should end this legend has it that a candidate is not important rather than as a potential member | the important thing is not the deputy but the candidate | the important thing is not parliament but the election period | a man who is left in a district of fifty thousand dollars up is undoubtedly a man who favors the district and the people grateful should vote for him unless the candidate is left hand bend | iii letter a reader sent me the following letter: mr d julio camba | dear sir: your article on the elections published in the sun on 13 contains several inaccuracies that i hasten to rectify | you say that the votes are in spain a major industry | oh mr camba | like many others this industry has been here considerably less | the crowd is terrible | some people sell their votes for two dollars | there are those who give in exchange for a meal a leisurely drive or a cigar | some people vote for friendship and there is something much worse: some people vote for political convictions | and this explains that men as candidates who have nowhere to fall dead | i think it should be a league of voters by imposing a minimum rate for votes | this would in my view the only practical way to enforce that citizens did our rights | five dollars per vote and if candidates do not accept we would go on strike | and do not talk to me of immorality | the fact that you charge your articles does not mean you sell your ideas | in fact one writer has no real independence of thought while it can not live by his pen and some of this is also true with voters | do you know what i had to do in the last election to value my right a little voter | then i had to vote twice: once for a candidate monarchy and other a republican | because that for candidates who pay more conservative votes it is not accurate mr camba | when in power what need have to pay | generally not even bother to throw us a speech | undeceive you | to raise a little industry there is no electoral procedure league | recently there was talk of salary to the deputies noted | very well but that members start by paying their constituents | and while there are people who vote for nothing i i can not believe that the right to vote for the people representing conquest no so far the letter of my correspondent | i as proof of fairness i reproduce in full | iv the author need a district in those beautiful days in may to be in tune with the customs and among my contemporaries do negligible role i need two things: a district and a straw hat | almost everyone has a district and a straw hat | some have straw hat and lack of district | others have only the district but can be counted on the fingers of one hand the spanish they are today while no district and no hat | reader: did not you will loose around a district to offer me | have you looked good |  all my friends have district and even boasts some people two or three | judging from the appearances in spain there are many more districts candidates and many more citizens eligible that electors | men who have spent the winter without a coat now appear in the gathering of coffee with great districts | no surprise me that some of them pawned his it is very beautiful single man's freedom but when one is becoming a bit old and begins to suffer stomach he misses a loving hand that bun in bed and serve him cups of broth | it is also very beautiful situation freelance writer but not at election time | at election time who does not feel the desire of a party political party to give you a loving and district would give a stock the tender wife | to go out and get his hat his stick and gloves you have the feeling these days that you are missing something still and what it lacks is a district | then in the usual coterie so all the friends start talking about their respective districts the man who lacks district is something of a pariah | the waiters serve them anyway | the boots do not go to your requirements life without district has come to seem as an unbearable burden | i suppose that people point me in the street saying: he's a man who does not have district | and so i am writing the reader asking one | after all a district is given to anyone | make the reader a little effort | i need a district and the need for any need | v spain parliamentarism emporio what is meant by a very mp | in spain for a very parliamentary enriende a man who has a lot parliament | mr dato for example and the count of romanones very parliamentarians are men | also is quite parliamentary mr garc a prieto | and i who at first glance seem parliamentary anything i am however considerably more than most spanish: members i have many friends i can have coffee in congress i can use the franchise parliamentary postal when mr maura dissolved the parliament said it was because being a very parliamentary would not approve the budget on the backs of national representation | representation was then datista national romanones albista socialist etc and mr maura needed maurista national representation in order not to govern the country back but according with him | i needed a parliament in short to not tell him that he was a ruler unparliamentary | and since i needed a parliament mr maura and who says mr maura said mr doe the devoted to it | first the head of government elected candidates | then candidates voters chose | and within days mr maura will own parliament as well as some gentlemen have a home theater | who said that here govern arbitrarily without taking into account the tastes and the interests of the country | here is no such thing | the country has shed its blood to achieve the parliamentary regime and respectful of the national will to each government will give here their respective parliament | in the same period of time no nation has had so many parliaments and spain | spain is undoubtedly the most parliamentary village in the world | vi new ministers when the present government falls our expenditure budget will be burdened with a how many more layoffs | for people to ask new ministers | what is meant by a new minister | for a new minister does not mean a young minister or a minister other than the other ministers but a man who is minister for the first time | a new minister is usually an old secretary a governor general old or older the marquis de mochales came to minister and died but this unfortunate event will be unique in our history | most politicians do not perceive their ambition to get filled ministers | being a minister is not in fact be nothing | a minister is at the mercy of power moderator at the mercy of the press at the mercy of the parliamentary opposition at the mercy of all the world | in contrast a former minister is not at the mercy of anyone | portfolios and the layoffs go remain | and this far from dying after they have sworn in is when the most ministers are beginning to live | ministers new |no never  a minister once again used and two or three months is converted from a former minister | there are countries with a strong economic life that can afford the luxury of frequent changes of ministers as well as a rich man changes frequently car but we are not in the same case | if every new layoff annulment of an unemployment old | if when mr prado palace for example be declared former minister cease to be former ministers or the marquis de lema bugallal count |  but today what we should do is get along with former ministers today | they are very very old so as the same old parliamentary system are bad and are old fashioned but we pose any new spending | well preserved these former ministers may take yet another another quarter century or half century which in spanish politics do not think it represents great thing | and when they die at all beyond the year 1950 then you may consider replacing with some young men and d melquiades alvarez for example or dr simard vii ministerial an article if i were a ministerial writer what item do about the last election | we have been beaten in big cities say but this does not surprise us | large cities are real sources of corruption which are lost entirely the feelings of humility obedience and love of the past | almost all local citizens can read and write and although a strong censure gag the writers of bad press solvents ideas always find a way by which people reach the brain | undoubtedly illiteracy worth a thousand times more than censorship | the whole art of radical writers crashes field man a man healthy in body and intelligence who can neither read nor need it to work the land of his lord and to give the vote to the candidate order | and voted man of the field ministerial candidacy | we have succeeded in the field which still retain the venerable traditions of our older where the doctor untainted by foreign theories good blood to their patients as in the days of our grandparents where the poor are resigned to being poor as the blond resigned to being blond where the priest prohibits dance on seized and newspapers are read liberal and which respects the order the property the clergy and the civil guard | we have triumphed in the field and have failed in the cities | is there anything more significant | because cities are left in the hand of god | in madrid the youth spend their lives dancing foreign dances drinking beverages and foreign a thousand times more heinous thing reading books foreign | now it has given the locals to put in the bath houses and lift and this be very pleasant for the body but it must be fatal to the soul | baths libraries large hotels political rights a university a people's house do our best need any of these things | days ago when madrid balconies adorned with all sorts of hangings tribute heart of jesus believed that the capital of spain did not repent and amend their errors | the election showed us that this assumption was false | undoubtedly madrid having hangings are wanting a pretext for display and whatever the pretext the exhibits but this show purely decorative never has an ideological character | madrid is lost and with him are lost every major spanish cities | they have been lost public libraries the press running water cosmopolitan hotel the telegraph telephone theaters in places of comfort are becoming vehicles sinful ideas and many other inventions of this century cursed |  for a writer ministerial all things are antiministeriales invention of this century | how could they vote for us | our defeat shows that we have nothing to do with this time of dissolution social | we represent the venerable traditions of our elders | we are the past | we are the year of nanita viii the deception of the crisis whenever a government falls i experience a feeling of liberation | the air seems pure whereas women more beautiful the food more palatable |  has taken odd jobs he exclaimed but at last we are free | we do not have government | we realized our ideal unfortunately it is in our nature can not ever realize happiness present | thus happiness is unattainable and therefore end up working out all ministerial crisis | after two or three days the government dropped is always replaced by another and again you have to devote to the task of demolishing | totaling the various crises that little by little we get only if spain will come to life each year a whole month government | a twelve months | not worth it | for my part i will never help to bring down any government as i do not guarantee then they will not replace it with another | more when the other is sure that we had also had to knock it down before | i do not see why a man may be worthwhile unmarried and self employed professionals who will govern dato or mr maura mr garc a prieto and mr s nchez de toca | probably much more interested these the governors to me i can never interested me that i govern them | and if a people can not live without a government a premise that does not grant any value while as now can not live with him and if people can not live without government and whether governments are a necessary evil then at least we must demand that the crisis will last a little longer | a crisis of three or four days is not worth the effort required blue bench to start these ministers who seem limpets | ix political action for seafood it initiates a change in spanish politics | until recent days politicians used to be between us a man in the province of pontevedra a personal friend of the marquis de riestra and father of a numerous family | when a countryman of mine had no job and could not do anything enabling it to live on their land if he had enough money to go to buenos aires came to madrid and spent a minister | for myself i say this summer sailors me in my town called none other than a school group those simple people knew i lived in madrid and i could not imagine living in anything other than a minister which after all showed a certain logic | if indeed most of my fellow residents in madrid were not ministers or former ministers how would arrange to pay the landlord | is it that mr garc a prieto for example the court would hold writing articles for el sol | but now to get a minister and not enough being born in the province pontevedra and starts to become indispensable to be catalan | and this is the change initiated in spanish politics | at first glance it seems that this is a superficial change and perhaps it is not in fact a very profound change | however i think that between the politician and the political galician catalan is a difference more important than the accent | what terrible politician galician was his uncanny ability to reproduce | born at the foot of the rias baixas those reproduced politicians like sardines | after fifteen years each minister had given life to five ministers ten deputies ten and twenty ceos governors excluding subordinate employees | everyone knows the fecundity of pontevedra province which is one of the most populous if not the most populated of spain | this fertility often attributed to seafood and if the explanation is accurate seafood come to be in the end the real culprits of nepotism spanish | nepotism spanish or oysters crabs and barnacles of the rias baixas |  catalan politicians do not seem to play as much as politicians galicia and this is by itself a great advantage for the country | do not eat perhaps many seafood in catalonia or is the mediterranean seafood worth less than the atlantic | on the other hand is known to us all the political possibilities of catalan seafood | if there someone in spain to study politics with a truly scientific approach i propose this problem which i consider a major interest but unfortunately theres no really serious political treatise | x take over when insubordination manifested in barcelona or in another province said the general aznar only proceed energetically dominates and makes it into law | if necessary he said it devastates the population i believe these words of general aznar have any more of a project and i strange to see that some newspapers reject it without taking the trouble to study it technically | because of course if any difficulty exists in spain to raze villages to me seems to be a purely technical difficulty | that's imagine that the government can not barcelona sweep on grounds of moral political or legal shows in my opinion a profound ignorance about razing | the difficulties of this triple character have little importance in the country of la cierva y s nchez guerra | instead the difficulties techniques are in the land of the same gentlemen some really serious | and sitting on this i think we should leave aside considerations idle and beg general aznar not to develop its plan | when general aznar who has in the army a place so high has hinted at the idea of razing barcelona to dominate the elements rebels is undoubtedly this idea is feasible | however general: we need a budget | we want to know how long and how much money it would compromise his honor to do in barcelona a sweeping way | the german army a formidable material and direction of the first order took four years to raze to the satisfaction of kaiser reims and reims to be one of the richest cities of france invested in destroying as much as what she was worth | of course we are not as demanding as the former kaiser | used countless resignations we'll probably settle for a much more devastation wider than that of the city of reims but what that would cost us arrasamientito | the case is that to avoid the remote possibility of losing barcelona once let's not really to lose twice first leveled and second investing money in the razing which cost the building | on the other hand barcelona is an urgent problem and if the leveling may take fifty or sixty years i do not think that constitutes an effective solution | the ecclesiastical councillor who had become acquainted with his own nature by long experience in preaching funeral sermons and sermons on the new year and knew full well that he was himself always the first person and frequently the last to be affected by the pathos of his own eloquence now rose with dignified solemnity on seeing himself and the others hanging so long by the dry rope and addressed the chamber: no man he said who had read his printed works could fail to know that he carried a heart about him as well as other people and a heart he would add that had occasion to repress such holy testimonies of its tenderness as tears lest he should thereby draw too heavily on the sympathies and the purses of his fellow men rather than elaborately to provoke them by stimulants for any secondary views or to serve an indirect purpose of his own: 'this heart ' said he 'has already shed tears but they were already shed secretly for kabel was my friend ' and so saying he paused for a moment and looked about him | with pleasure he observed that all were sitting as dry as corks: indeed at this particular moment when he himself by interrupting their several water works had made them furiously angry it might as well have been expected that crocodiles fallow deer elephants witches or ravens should weep for van der kabel as his presumptive heirs | among them all flacks was the only one who continued to make way: he kept steadily before his mind the following little extempore assortment of objects: van der kabel's good and beneficent acts the old petticoats so worn and tattered and the gray hair of his female congregation at morning service lazarus with his dogs his own long coffin innumerable decapitations the sorrows of werther a miniature field of battle and finally himself and his own melancholy condition at this moment itself enough to melt any heart condemned as he was in the bloom of youth by the second clause of van der kabel's will to tribulation and tears and struggles: well done flacks | three strokes more with the pump handle and the water is pumped up and the house along with it | meantime glantz the ecclesiastical councillor proceeded in his pathetic harangue 'oh kabel my kabel '| he ejaculated and almost wept with joy at the near approach of his tears 'the time shall come that by the side of thy loving breast covered with earth mine also shall lie mouldering and in cor ' ruption he would have said but flacks starting up in trouble and with eyes overflowing threw a hasty glance around him and said 'with submission gentlemen to the best of my belief i am weeping '| then sitting down with great satisfaction he allowed the tears to stream down his face that done he soon recovered his cheerfulness and his aridity | glantz the councillor thus saw the prize fished away before his eyes those very eyes which he had already brought into an accessit 19 or inchoate state of humidity this vexed him: and his mortification was the greater on thinking of his own pathetic exertions and the abortive appetite for the prize which he had thus uttered in words as ineffectual as his own sermons and at this moment he was ready to weep for spite and 'to weep the more because he wept in vain '| as to flacks a protocol was immediately drawn up of his watery compliance with the will of van der kabel: and the messuage in dog street was knocked down to him for ever | the mayor adjudged it to the poor devil with all his heart: indeed this was the first occasion ever known in haslau on which the tears of a schoolmaster and a curate had converted themselves not into mere amber that incloses only a worthless insect like the tears of heliodes but like those of the goddess freia into heavy gold | glantz congratulated flacks very warmly and observed with a smiling air that possibly he had himself lent him a helping hand by his pathetic address | as to the others the separation between them and flacks was too palpable in the mortifying distinction of wet and dry to allow of any cordiality between them and they stood aloof therefore: but they stayed to hear the rest of the will which they now awaited in a state of anxious agitation |  19 to the english reader it may be necessary to explain that in the continental universities etc when a succession of prizes is offered graduated according to the degrees of merit the illiptical formula of 'accessit' denotes the second prize and hence where only a single prize is offered the second degree of merit may properly be expressed by the term here used |  20 from a ms | poem of a great living poet |  written in january 1838 | the lines occur in wordsworth's prelude book tenth line 410 | mr schnackenberger or two masters for one dog | from the german | chapter i in what manner mr schnackenberger made his entry into b | the sun had just set and all the invalids at the baths of b had retired to their lodgings when the harsh tones of welcome from the steeple announced the arrival of a new guest | forthwith all the windows were garrisoned with young faces and old faces pretty faces and ugly faces and scarce one but was overspread with instantaneous merriment a feu de joie of laughter that travelled up the street in company with the very extraordinary object that now advanced from the city gates | upon a little meagre scare crow of a horse sate a tall broad shouldered young fellow in a great coat of bright pea green whose variegated lights and shades from soaking rains and partial dryings bore sullen testimony to the changeable state of the weather for the last week | out of this great coat shot up to a monstrous height a head surmounted by a huge cocked hat one end of which hung over the stem the other over the stern of the horse: the legs belonging to this head were sheathed in a pair of monstrous boots technically called 'field pieces ' which descending rather too low were well plaistered with flesh coloured mud | more perhaps in compliance with the established rule than for any visible use a switch was in the rider's hand for to attribute to such a horse under such a load any power to have quitted a pace that must have satisfied the most rigorous police in poland was obviously too romantic | depending from his side and almost touching the ground rattled an enormous back sword which suggested to the thinking mind a salutary hint to allow free passage without let or unseasonable jesting to mr jeremiah schnackenberger student at the university of x | he that might be disposed to overlook this hint would certainly pay attention to a second which crept close behind the other in the shape of a monstrous dog somewhat bigger than the horse and presenting on every side a double tier of most respectable teeth | observing the general muster of the natives which his appearance had called to the windows the rider had unslung and mounted a pipe under whose moving canopy of clouds and vapours he might advance in greater tranquillity: and during this operation his very thoughtful and serious horse had struck up a by street and made a dead stop before his rider was aware at the sign of the golden sow | although the gold had long since vanished from the stone beast and to say the truth every part of the house seemed to sympathise admirably with the unclean habits of its patron image nevertheless mr jeremiah thought proper to comply with the instincts of his horse and as nobody in the street or in the yard came forward to answer his call he gave himself no further trouble but rode on through the open door right forwards into the bar | chapter ii | how mr jeremiah came to take up his quarters at the golden sow | 'the lord and his angels protect us as i live here comes the late governor '| ejaculated the hostess mrs bridget sweetbread suddenly startled out of her afternoon's nap by the horse's hoofs and seeing right before her what she took for the apparition of don juan whom as it afterwards appeared she had seen in a pantomime the night before | 'thunder and lightning | my good woman ' said the student laughing 'would you dispute the reality of my flesh and blood '| mrs bridget however on perceiving her mistake cared neither for the sword nor for the dog but exclaimed 'why then let me tell you sir it's not the custom in this country to ride into parlours and disturb honest folks when they're taking their rest | innkeeping's not the trade it has been to me god he knows: but for all that i'll not put up with such work from nobody '| 'good my dear creature what you say is good very good: but let me tell you it's not good that i must be kept waiting in the street and no soul in attendance to take my horse and feed him '| 'oh that base villain of a hostler '| said the landlady immediately begging pardon and taking hold of the bridle whilst mr schnackenberger dismounted | 'that's a good creature ' said he 'i love you for this: and i don't care if i take up my quarters here which at first was not my intention | have you room for me '| 'room '| answered mrs sweetbread 'ah | now there's just the whole golden sow at your service the more's the pity '| on mr jeremiah's asking the reason for this superfluity of room she poured out a torrent of abuse against the landlord of the double barrelled gun who not content with having at all times done justice to his sign had latterly succeeded with the help of vicious coachmen and unprincipled postilions in drawing away her whole business and had at length utterly ruined the once famous inn of the golden sow | and true it was that the apartment into which she now introduced her guest showed some vestiges of ancient splendour in the pictures of six gigantic sows | the late landlord had been a butcher and had christened his inn from his practice of slaughtering a pig every week and the six swine as large as life and each bearing a separate name were designed to record his eminent skill in the art of fattening | his widow who was still in mourning for him must certainly have understood mr schnackenberger's words 'i love you for this ' in a sense very little intended by the student | for she brought up supper herself and with her own hand unarmed with spoon or other implement dived after and secured a little insect which was floundering about in the soup | so much the greater was her surprise on observing that after such flattering proofs of attention her guest left the soup untouched and made no particular application to the other dishes so well harmonising with the general character of the golden sow | at last however she explained his want of appetite into the excess of his passion for herself and on that consideration failed not to lay before him a statement of her flourishing circumstances and placed in a proper light the benefits of a marriage with a woman somewhat older than himself | mr schnackenberger whose good nature was infinite occasionally interrupted his own conversation with juno the great dog who meantime was dispatching the supper without any of her master's scruples to throw in a 'yes ' or a 'no ' a 'well ' or a 'so so '| but at length his patience gave way and he started up saying 'well: sufficit: now march old witch '| this harmless expression she took in such ill part that for mere peace' sake he was obliged to lead her to the door and shut her out: and then undressing himself he stepped into bed and in defiance of the straw which everywhere stuck out and a quilt of a hundred weight 21 he sunk into a deep slumber under the agreeable serenade of those clamorous outcries which mrs sweetbread still kept up on the outside of the door |  21 the custom in north germany is to sleep under a bed as well as upon one consequently when this happens to be a cheap one it cannot be stuffed with feathers down c but with some heavier material | chapter iii | in which our hero polishes a rough rider | 'fire and furies '| exclaimed mr schnackenberger as juno broke out into uproarious barking about midnight: the door was opened from the outside and in stepped the landlady arrayed in a night dress that improved her charms into a rivalry with those of her sign at the street door accompanied by a fellow who by way of salutation cracked an immense hunting whip | 'so it's here that i'm to get my own again '| cried the fellow: and forthwith mr jeremiah stepped out of bed and hauled him up to the light of the lamp which the landlady carried | 'yes sir ' said the rough rider 'it's i sure enough ' and to judge by the countenance of his female conductor every accent of his anger was music of the spheres to her unquenchable wrath: 'i'm the man sure enough whose horse you rode away with and that you'll find to be a true bill '| 'rode away with '| cried mr jeremiah: 'now may the sweetest of all thunderbolts but rascal this instant what's to pay | then take thy carrion out of the stable and be off '| so saying mr schnackenberger strode to the bed for his well filled purse | on these signs of solvency however the horse dealer turned up the gentle phasis of his character and said 'nay nay since things are so why it's all right and in the lord's name keep the horse as long as you want him '|'dog  in the first place and firstly tell me what's your demand | in the second place and secondly go to the d l '| but whilst the rough rider continued with low bows to decline the first offer being satisfied as it seemed with the second the choleric mr schnackenberger cried out 'seize him juno '| and straightway juno leaped upon him and executed the arrest so punctually that the trembling equestrian without further regard to ceremony made out his charge | forthwith mr jeremiah paid down the demand upon the table throwing in something extra with the words 'that for the fright '| the dealer in horse flesh returned him a thousand thanks hoped for his honour's further patronage and then upon being civilly assured by mr jeremiah that if he did not in one instant walk down the stairs he would to his certain knowledge have to fly down them the rough rider in company with the landlady took a rapid and polite leave of mr schnackenberger who was too much irritated by the affront to compose himself again to sleep | chapter iv | how mr schnackenberger and juno conduct themselves when the house becomes too hot to hold them | day was beginning to dawn when a smoke which forced its way through the door and which grew every instant thicker and more oppressive a second time summoned mr schnackenberger from his bed | as he threw open the door such a volume of flames rolled in from the staircase which was already on fire from top to bottom that he saw there was no time to be lost: so he took his pipe loaded it as quickly as possible lighted it from the flames of the staircase began smoking and then drawing on his pea green coat and buckling on his sword he put his head out of the window to see if there were any means of escape | to leap right down upon the pavement seemed too hazardous and the most judicious course it struck him would be to let himself down upon the golden sow which was at no great depth below his window and from this station to give the alarm | even this however could not be reached without a leap: mr schnackenberger attempted it and by means of his great talents for equilibristic exercises he hit the mark so well that he planted himself in the very saddle as it were upon the back of this respectable brute | unluckily however there was no house opposite and mrs sweetbread with her people slept at the back | hence it was that for a very considerable space of time he was obliged to continue riding the sign of the golden sow whilst juno for whom he could not possibly make room behind him looked out of the window and accompanied her master's text of occasional clamours for assistance with a very appropriate commentary of howls | some poles at length passed by: but not understanding one word of german and seeing a man thus betimes in the morning mounted on the golden sow smoking very leisurely and occasionally hallooing as if for his private amusement they naturally took mr schnackenberger for a maniac: until at length the universal language of fire which now began to burst out of the window threw some light upon the darkness of their polish understandings | immediately they ran for assistance which about the same moment the alarm bells began to summon | however the fire engines arrived on the ground before the ladders: these last were the particular objects of mr jeremiah's wishes: meantime in default of those and as the second best thing that could happen the engines played with such a well directed stream of water upon the window upon the golden sow and upon mr jeremiah schnackenberger that for one while they were severally rendered tolerably fire proof | when at length the ladders arrived and the people were on the point of applying them to the golden sow he earnestly begged that they would first of all attend to a case of more urgent necessity: for himself he was well mounted as they saw could assure them that he was by no means in a combustible state and if they would be so good as to be a little more parsimonious with their water he didn't care if he continued to pursue his morning's ride a little longer | on the other hand juno at the window to the right was reduced every moment to greater extremities as was pretty plainly indicated by the increasing violence of her howling | but the people took it ill that they should be desired to rescue a four legged animal and peremptorily refused | 'my good lads ' said the man upon the sow 'for heaven's sake don't delay any longer: one heaven as pfeffel observes is over all good creatures that are pilgrims on this earth let their travelling coat which by the way is none of their own choosing be what it may smooth like yours and mine or shaggy like juno's '| but all to no purpose: not pfeffel himself in propri person could have converted them from the belief that to take any trouble about such a brute was derogatory to the honour of the very respectable citizens of b | recovered somewhat to our economist was with his friend and others employees to the superintendent's room the mayor was in san sebastian and there

madrid a slaughter at for as little troops here is the so called democrats and demagogues will lie the street | nobody would know me there and i might at any rate keep juno a fortnight longer | and exactly in this way it had happened that mr schnackenberger had come to b | at this instant he was indebted to a lucky accident for a momentary diversion of his thoughts from the danger which threatened him in regard to juno | amongst other visitors to the baths who were passing by at this early hour happened to be the princess of | her carriage drew up at the very moment when mr jeremiah having dismounted from the sow was descending the ladder: with her usual gracious manner she congratulated the student upon his happy deliverance and finding that he was a countryman of her own she invited him to a ball which she gave on the evening of that day in honour of the king's birthday | now it must be acknowledged that a ball room was not exactly the stage on which mr schnackenberger's habits of life had qualified him for shining: however the pleasure of a nearer acquaintance with the interesting princess held out too flattering a prospect to allow of his declining her invitation | just at this moment juno returned | meantime the fire occasioned probably by a spark falling from the landlady's lamp amongst the straw under the staircase had been extinguished: and mrs sweetbread who had at length been roused at the back now made her appearance and with many expressions of regret for what had happened to mr schnackenberger who had entirely re established himself in her esteem by his gold laden purse and also by what she called his 'very handsome behaviour' to the horse dealer she requested that he would be pleased to step into one of her back rooms at the same time offering to reinstate his clothes in wearable condition by drying them as rapidly as possible: a necessity which was too clamorously urgent for immediate attention to allow of the dripping student's rejecting her offer | chapter vi | in what manner mr jeremiah prepared himself for the ball | as mr jeremiah stood looking out of the window for the purpose of whiling away a tedious forenoon it first struck his mind upon the sight of a number of men dressed very differently from himself that his wardrobe would scarcely match with the festal splendour of the f te at which he was to be present in the evening | even if it had been possible to overlook the tarnished lustre of his coat not much embellished by its late watery trials upon the golden sow yet he could not possibly make his appearance in a surtout | he sent therefore to one tailor after another: but all assured him that they had their hands much too full of business to undertake the conversion of his surtout into a dress coat against the evening still less could they undertake to make a new one | just as vainly did he look about for shoes: many were on sale but none of them with premises spacious enough to accommodate his very respectable feet | all this put him into no little perplexity | true it was that mrs sweetbread had spontaneously thrown open to his inspection the wardrobe of her deceased husband | but even he had contrived to go through this world in shoes of considerably smaller dimensions than mr jeremiah demanded | and from a pretty large choice of coats there was not one which he could turn to account | for to say nothing of their being one and all too short by a good half ell even in the very best of them he looked precisely as that man looks who has lately slaughtered a hog or as that man looks who designs to slaughter a hog | now then when all his plans for meeting the exigencies of his case had turned out abortive suddenly a bold idea struck him | in a sort of inspiration he seized a pair of scissors for the purpose of converting with his own untutored hand of genius his pea green surtout into a pea green frock | this operation having in his own judgment succeeded to a marvel he no longer hesitated to cut out a pair of ball shoes from his neat's leather 'field pieces '| whatever equipments were still wanting could be had for money with the exception of a shirt and as to that the wedding shirt of the late mr sweetbread would answer the purpose very passably | what provoked our hero most of all were the new patent shoe buckles the fine points of which would not take firm hold of the coarse leather shoes but on every bold step burst asunder so that he was obliged to keep his eye warily upon them and in consideration of their tender condition to set his feet down to the ground very gently | the hostess had just sunk pretty deep into her customary failing of intoxication when he went to her and asked how he looked in his gala dress | 'look '| said she 'why like a king baked in gingerbread | that is what god wants |resignation  the mobs will soon invade this house to loot not sparing anyone | let us be worthy accept martyrdom | he was going through something in my throat silent all taking the noise in city halls and the courtyard sounded | great anxiety reigned throughout the house | neighbors went to the door to get news and communicate their views | down some

bringas leaving the hallway they saw that there ran some residents of the city as sedate as if nothing happened |  but what |  nothing: a few kids who are stirring in the portal but no care | of city

that continued overnight unrest | bringas and many neighbors stayed up or did bring supplies for several days | at every moment feared being undertaken by mobs | but to my great surprise found that no sound disturbed the peace of the alcazar august | it seemed that the monarchy was still sleeping on it quiet and calm like the good times | on the morning of 30 candida went very suffocated |  do not know what's going on |  said before greeting |  what madam what |  asked everyone with the greatest anxiety believing that something very great had occurred |  well those poor people that guards at the palace has not eaten all night |'ah  my darling '| said he laughing 'just mind juno: have an eye to juno my darling ' and for juno's sake he suppressed the 'old witch ' that his lips were itching a second time to be delivered of | chapter vii | mr schnackenberger is enamoured and of whom and what prospects open upon him in his pursuit of 'la belle passion '| at the hotel of the princess all the resources of good taste and hospitality were called forth to give clat to the f te and do honour to the day and by ten o'clock a very numerous and brilliant company had already assembled | so much the more astounding must have been the entry of mr jeremiah schnackenberger who by the way was already familiar to the eyes of many from his very public entrance into the city on the preceding evening and to others from his morning's exhibition on the golden sow | his eyes and his thoughts being occupied by the single image of the fascinating hostess of course it no more occurred to him to remark that his self constructed coat was detaching itself at every step from its linings whilst the pockets of the ci devant surtout still displayed their original enormity of outline than in general it would ever have occurred to him that the tout ensemble of his costume was likely to make and had in fact made a very great sensation | this very general attention to mr schnackenberger and the total unconsciousness of this honour on the part of mr schnackenberger himself did not escape the notice of the princess and at the first opportunity she dispatched a gentleman to draw his attention to the indecorum of his dress and to put him in the way of making the proper alterations | laughter and vexation struggled in mr schnackenberger's mind when he became aware of the condition of his equipments: and he very gladly accompanied the ambassador of his hostess into a private room where clothes and shoes were furnished him in which he looked like any other reasonable man | on his return to the ball room he lost no time in making his acknowledgments to the princess and explaining the cause of his unbecoming attire | the princess with a natural goodness of heart and true hospitality was anxious to do what she could to restore her strange guest to satisfaction with himself and to establish him in some credit with the company: she had besides discovered with pleasure that amidst all his absurdities mr schnackenberger was really a man of some ability: on these several considerations therefore she exerted herself to maintain a pretty long conversation with him which honour mr jeremiah so far misinterpreted as to ascribe it to an interest of a very tender character | to mr schnackenberger who had taken up the very extraordinary conceit that his large person had some attractions about it there could naturally be nothing very surprising in all this: and he felt himself called upon not to be wanting to himself but to push his good fortune | accordingly he kept constantly about the person of the princess: let her move in what direction she would there was mr jeremiah schnackenberger at hand ready to bewitch her with his conversation and having discovered that she was an amateur of botany and purposed visiting a botanical garden on the following day he besieged her with offers of his services in the capacity of guide | 'possibly when the time comes ' said the princess aloud 'i shall avail myself of your goodness ' and the visible displeasure with which she withdrew herself from his worrying importunities so obviously disposed all the bystanders to smile that mr schnackenberger himself became alive to his own b tise and a blush of shame and vexation suffused his countenance | what served at the moment greatly to exasperate these feelings was the behaviour of a certain mr von pilsen who had from the first paid uncommon attention to the very extraordinary phenomenon presented by mr schnackenberger's person had watched the whole course of the persecutions with which he had distressed the princess and at this moment seemed quite unable to set any bounds to his laughter | in extreme dudgeon mr schnackenberger hastened into one of the most remote apartments and flung himself back upon a sofa | covering his eyes with his hands he saw none of the numbers who passed by him | but the first time that he looked up behold | a paper was lying upon his breast | he examined it attentively and found the following words written in pencil to all appearance by a female hand: 'we are too narrowly watched in this place | to morrow morning about nine o'clock | the beautiful botanic gardens will secure us a fortunate rendezvous '| 'aye ' said mr jeremiah 'sure enough it's from her '| he read the note again and again: and the more unhappy he had just now been so much the more was he now intoxicated with his dawning felicities | chapter viii | in which juno plays a principal part | the rattling of a chain through crashing glass and porcelain which spread alarm through the ball room would hardly have drawn mr schnackenberger's attention in his present condition of rapturous elevation had not the well known voice of juno reached his ears at the same moment | he hurried after the sound shocked and to be shocked | the fact was simply this: juno had very early in the evening withdrawn herself from the surveillance of the golden sow and had followed her master's steps | often ejected from the mansion of the princess she had as often returned so that at last it was thought best to chain her up in the garden | unfortunately a kitten belonging to a young female attendant of the princess had suddenly run past juno made a rush after it the chain broke away from the woodwork of the kennel the panic struck kitten retreated into the house taking the first road which presented: close upon the rear of the kitten pressed juno and her chain close upon the rear of juno pressed the young woman in anguish for her kitten's life and armed with a fly flapper and the road happening to lead into the ball room the whole train pursuers and pursued helter skelter fell into the quarters of the waltzers | the kitten attempted to take up a position behind a plateau on one of the side boards: but from this she was immediately dislodged by juno and the retreat commencing afresh right across the side boards which were loaded with refreshments all went to wreck glasses and china all was afloat sherbet and lemonade raspberry vinegar and orgeat: and at the very moment when mr jeremiah returned the belligerent powers dripping with celestial nectar having just charged up a column of dancers were wheeling through the door by which he had entered: and the first check to the wrath of juno was the seasonable arrest of her master's voice | that the displeasure of the dancers who had been discomposed and besprinkled by juno fell entirely upon her master was pretty evident from their faces | of all the parties concerned however none was more irritated than the young woman she was standing upon the stairs caressing and fondling her kitten as mr schnackenberger went down leading juno in his pocket handkerchief and she let drop some such very audible hints upon the ill breeding and boorishness of certain pretended gentlemen that mr schnackenberger would without doubt have given her a very severe reprimand if he had not thought it more dignified to affect to overlook her | chapter ix | which treats of experiments not very common at birthday f tes | 'now my dears ' said mr von pilsen to a party who were helping him to laugh at the departed mr schnackenberger 'as soon as the fellow returns we must get him into our party at supper '| 'returns '| exclaimed another 'why i should fancy he had had enough of birthday f tes for one life '| 'you think so '| said von pilsen: 'so do not i no no my good creature i flatter myself that i go upon pretty sure grounds: i saw those eyes which he turned upon the princess on making his exit: and mind what i say he takes his beast home and comes back again | therefore be sure and get him amongst us at supper and set the barrel abroach | i wouldn't for all the world the monster should go away untapped '| the words were scarce uttered when sure enough the body or 'barrel ' of mr schnackenberger did roll into the room for a second time | forthwith von pilsen and his party made up to him and pilsen having first with much art laboured to efface any suspicions which might have possessed the student's mind in consequence of his former laughter proceeded to thank him for the very extraordinary sport which his dog had furnished and protested that he must be better acquainted with him | 'why as to that ' said mr schnackenberger 'a better acquaintance must naturally be very agreeable to me | but in respect to the dog and what you call the sport i'm quite of another opinion and would give all i'm worth that it had not happened '|'oh  no ' they all declared 'the f te would have wanted its most brilliant features if mr schnackenberger or his dog had been absent | no no: without flattery he must allow them to call him the richest fund of amusement the brightest attraction of the evening '| but schnackenberger shook his head incredulously said he wished he could think so: but with a deep sigh he persisted in his own opinion in which he was the more confirmed when he perceived that the princess who was now passing him to the supper room turned away her eyes the moment she perceived him | in this state of mind mr jeremiah naturally but unconsciously lent himself to the designs of his new acquaintances | every glass that the devil of mischief and of merry malice poured out did the devil of schnackenberger's despair drink off until at last the latter devil was tolerably well drowned in wine | about this time enter juno again being her second and positively last appearance upon these boards | mr jeremiah's new friends paid so much homage to the promising appearance of her jaws that they made room for her very respectfully as she pressed up to her master | he whose recent excesses in wine had re established juno in the plenitude of her favour saw with approving calmness his female friend lay both her fore paws on the table and appropriate all that remained on his plate to the extreme astonishment of all present | 'my friend ' said mr jeremiah to a footman who was on the point of pulling away the unbidden guest 'don't you for god's sake get into any trouble | my juno understands no jesting on these occasions: and it might so happen that she would leave a mark of her remembrance with you that you would not forget so long as you lived '| 'but i suppose sir you won't expect that a dog can be allowed to sup with her highness's company '|'oh  faith sir credit me the dog is a more respectable member of society than yourself and many a one here present: so just leave me and my juno unmolested | else i may perhaps take the trouble to make an example of you '| the princess whose attention was now drawn made a sign to the servant to retire and von pilsen and his friends could scarcely keep down their laughter to a well bred key when mr schnackenberger drew his pipe from his pocket loaded it lit it at one of the chandeliers over the supper table and in one minute wrapped the whole neighbourhood in a voluminous cloud of smoke | as some little damper to their merriment however mr schnackenberger addressed a few words to them from time to time: 'you laugh gentlemen ' said he 'and doubtless there's something or other very amusing no doubt infinitely amusing if one could but find it out | however i could make your appetites for laughing vanish aye vanish in one moment | for understand me now one word one little word from me to juno and in two minutes the whole room shall be as empty as if it had been swept out with a broom | just the first that i look at no matter whom she catches by the breast aye just you sir or you sir or you mr von pilsen ' fixing his eye upon him 'if i do but say seize him juno '| the word had fled: and in the twinkling of an eye juno's fore paws not over clean were fixed in the elegant white silk waistcoat of mr von pilsen | this scene was the signal for universal uproar and alarm | even mr jeremiah on remarking the general rising of the company though totally unaware that his harmless sport had occasioned it rose also called the dog off: and comforted von pilsen who was half dead with fright by assuring him that had he but said 'bite him juno '|  matters would have ended far worse | on mr schnackenberger's standing up his bodily equilibrium was manifestly so much endangered that one of the company out of mere humanity offered his servant to see him safe home | a slight consciousness of his own condition induced our hero to accept of this offer: through some misunderstanding however the servant led him not to the golden sow but to the double barrelled gun | mr schnackenberger on being asked for his number said 'no | 5 ' that being the number of his room at the golden sow | he was accordingly shown up to no | 5: and finding a bed under an alcove he got into it dressed as he was and in one moment had sunk into a profound slumber | chapter x which narrates an engagement on unequal terms first for one side then for the other | i think that i'm hearing | it was the day before leaving for the restrooms | came to buy some artificial flowers | he spoke of you and said what a laugh |  you said it was a corny | rosalia froze | that phrase struck to the quick of his soul | like stab never received | and when hurrying down the stairs the pain of that wound tormented self esteem more than he received in his honor | a cheesy | the awful anathema was fixed in his mind which should be left as an eternal sign stamped on fire meat |  my god what i experienced today only you know i think i have gone gray i thought to go by car to the house of torquemada | what golgotha | and he went and came eagerly because they had already struck three | but he was lucky to find the inquisitor impatient and ready to go to the palace | was smiling and asked the the health of the family | the worship of the donut shaped with the fingers not mortified as well as other days | the taste of averting this great peril and rid itself of such creditor unsympathetic not allowed to look at externalities more or less fulsome | shortening the session as possible be dismissed | the humiliation of that day were so nervous |  no miracles might have said that about me i thought palace road tormented by registration horrible that burned his face | it is a lie of that rascal what day | when i get home the first thing i see is if i was filled with gray | the thing is not has been for less | the first thing he did was look in the mirror | put it to the relief of the ladies that similar situation could see | he had not left any channels | and if you left no you know | and if it is known it would have already searched through cover them | what it is beyond doubt is that as a result of the setbacks of those days the lady was so flat and listless with the spirits so that her husband came to figure who had lost his health |  you have something i do not deny it | want to come the doctor |  you see if you had taken baths jeronimos you sing a different story | but she claimed having nothing and if not objected to the doctor to come nor any condition stated in this final | it was all kinds of rogues nerves those devils that play in disturbing the ladies who if not

if the estimate that he felt there was a considerable decrease the outward forms of respect and accused some refinement study | a number of trials are given this but unable to put in light of evidence the causes of such sybaritic external affections we must resort to the hypothesis and see in them something akin to the blandishments that are used for religious instruction to an employee of customs when you want to smuggle | rosalia proved peaceful and venal system for the stash their rags | was gradually displaying them | every day repairing d francisco something new locking a discussion that she was trying to appease with graceful touch and lies and sweetish terms | but not always succeed and the honest gentleman came to be seriously worried those going out to scuttle luxuries such as theaters surprises | and after all this there are you hopping away at the ball wi' some painted doll looking babies in her eyes quite forgetting me that has to sit up for you at home pining and grieving: and all isn't enough but at last you must trot off to another inn '| 'what then ' said mr schnackenberger 'is it fact that i'm not at the golden sow '| 'charming '| said mrs sweetbread 'and so you would make believe you don't know it but i shall match you or find them as will: rest you sure of that '| 'children '| said mr schnackenberger to the waiter and boots who were listening in astonishment with the door half open 'of all loves rid me of this monster '| 'aye what '| said she in a voice of wrath and put herself on the defensive | but a word or two of abuse against the landlord of the double barrelled gun which escaped her in her heat irritated the men to that degree that in a few moments afterwards mrs sweetbread was venting her wrath in the street to the wonder of all passers by who looked after her until she vanished into the house of a well known attorney | meantime mr schnackenberger having on inquiry learned from the waiter in what manner he had come to the inn and the night scene which had followed was apologizing to the owner of no | 5 when to his great alarm the church clock struck eleven | 'nine ' he remembered was the hour fixed by the billet: and the more offence he might have given to the princess by his absurdities over night of which he had some obscure recollection so much the more necessary was it that he should keep the appointment | the botanic garden was two miles off: so shutting up juno he ordered a horse: and in default of boots which alas | existed no longer in that shape he mounted in silk stockings and pumps and rode off at a hand gallop | chapter xii | mr schnackenberger's engagement with an old butterwoman | the student was a good way advanced on his road when he descried the princess attended by another lady and a gentleman approaching in an open carriage | as soon however as he was near enough to be recognised by the party in the carriage the princess turned away her head with manifest signs of displeasure purely as it appeared to avoid noticing mr jeremiah | scarcely however was the carriage past him together with mr von pilsen who galloped by him in a tumult of laughter when the ill fate of our hero so ordered it that all eyes which would not notice him for his honour should be reverted upon his disgrace | the white turnpike gate so frightened our rider's horse that he positively refused to pass it: neither whip nor spur would bring him to reason | meantime up comes an old butterwoman |  23 at the very moment when she was passing the horse in his panic steps back and deposits one of his hind legs in the basket of the butterwoman: down comes the basket with all its eggs rotten and sound and down comes the old woman squash into the midst of them | murder murder  shouted the butterwoman and forthwith every individual thing that could command a pair or two pair of legs ran out of the turnpike house the carriage of the princess drew up to give the ladies a distant view of mr schnackenberger engaged with the butterwoman and mr von pilsen wheeled his horse round into a favourable station for seeing anything the ladies might overlook | rage gave the old butterwoman strength she jumped up nimbly and seized mr schnackenberger so stoutly by the laps of his coat that he vainly endeavoured to extricate himself from her grasp | at this crisis up came juno and took her usual side in such disputes | but to do this with effect juno found it necessary first of all to tear off the coat lap for the old woman keeping such firm hold of it how else could juno lay her down on her back set her paws upon her breast and then look up to her master as if asking for a certificate of having acquitted herself to his satisfaction |  23 in the original 'eine marketenderin ' a female sutler: but i have altered it to save an explanation of what the old sutler was after | to rid himself of spectators mr jeremiah willingly paid the old woman the full amount of her demand and then returned to the city | it disturbed him greatly however that the princess should thus again have seen him under circumstances of disgrace | anxious desire to lay open his heart before her and to place himself in a more advantageous light if not as to his body yet at all events as to his intellect determined him to use his utmost interest with her to obtain a private audience 'at which ' thought he 'i can easily beg her pardon for having overslept the appointed hour '| chapter xiii | in which good luck and bad luck are distributed in equal proportions | the good luck seemed to have anticipated mr schnackenberger's nearest wishes | for on reaching the double barrelled gun whither he arrived without further disturbance than that of the general gazing to which he was exposed by the fragment of a coat which survived from the late engagement a billet was put into his hands of the following tenor: 'come and explain this evening if you can explain your astonishing neglect of this morning's appointment | i shall be at the theatre and shall do what i can to dismiss my attendants '| but bad luck came also in the person of a lawyer | the lawyer stated that he called on the part of the landlady of the golden sow to put the question for the last time in civil terms 'whether mr schnackenberger were prepared to fulfil those just expectations which he had raised in her heart or whether she must be compelled to pursue her claims by due course of law '| mr schnackenberger was beginning to launch out with great fury upon the shameless and barefaced impudence of such expectations: but the attorney interrupted him and observed with provoking coolness 'that there was no occasion for any warmth no occasion in the world that certainly mrs sweetbread could not have framed these expectations wholly out of the air: something and he grinned sarcastically something it must be supposed had passed: now for instance this wedding shirt of the late mr sweetbread she would hardly i think have resigned this to your use mr schnackenberger unless some engagements had preceded either in the shape of words or of actions | however said he this is no part of my business: what remains for me to do on this occasion is to present her account and let me add that i am instructed to say that if you come to a proper understanding with her on the first point no further notice will be taken of this last part of my client's demand | the unfortunate mr schnackenberger considered the case most ruefully and in awful perturbation | he perspired exceedingly | however at length 'come i don't care ' said he 'i know what i'll do:' and then sitting down he drew up a paper which he presented to mr attorney at the same time explaining to him that rather than be exposed in a court of justice as a supposed lover of mrs sweetbread's he was content to pay the monstrous charges of her bill without applying to a magistrate for his revision: but upon this condition only that mrs sweetbread should for herself heirs and assigns execute a general release with regard to mr jeremiah schnackenberger's body according to the form here drawn up by himself and should engage on no pretence whatever to set up any claim to him in times to come | an account book was laundress open on the bedside table showing female letter notes: chambre 6 petticoats 14 etc the pedestal was made of iron with black lacquer and painted flowers | on the mantelpiece a clock unworthily elegant bronze alternated with two gold china dogs a very bad taste with broken ears | the blades of the walls were crooked and one of the curtains torn stained floor the pendant with the tube ahumad simo | for the poor ajar bedroom door was a bed large golden imperial armor without undoing and clothes in disarray as if someone had finished up | refugio believed that he visited mrs bringas yielding at last to their bodies to view the articles in your industry |  you've come a bit late he said | do you know that i'm selling everything | i'm no good for this | do not know what i was thinking about my sister when i did i could get trader for you to take charge since i'm in i have not done more than lose money just pay and i have no genius to bother so quit sooner of these rags the better | many women have come and go taking what little i have left |  however rosalie said pulling a box number and aigrettes marabouts and other links and cords there are still some very nice here |  do you like you said these aigrettes refugio joyful to be lavish with it | you can take them is the gift |  oh no missing no more yes yes i have much pleasure in it | for some i buy it and not pay it is better look here said going to the room i also give this hat is not fixed but can you take the tape you want | rosalia this generosity astonished and somewhat willing to look with eyes more refugio benevolent insisted on rejecting the gifts |  do i snubs you because i am poor |  he said with steely counterclaim | if rosalie had not gone to see in order to know if your desire for money provided not such that forced her to go through it might have rejected the subtleties with this woman so inferior to her in every way i wanted to climb up to high field but would not show disdain at the time to ask a favor and what for so demeaning | when it came to mind the idea of making his request his whole being soaked in disgust as if you enter the pores and bitter liquor disgusting and run down their veins and climbed to the palate | several times he made his demand for forces falt ronle it | even thought to say nothing and get away from that house | but the inflexible logic of its necessity the moored there and seeing no other choice commitment eral forced to go through with that calyx |  since i made the sacrifice to come i thought no i will not try his luck | no sir do as i bid you just bring me the dreadnought and a round hat '| the waiter obeyed: and although the dreadnought was by one good ell too short yet mr jeremiah exulted in his strange apparel because he flattered himself that in such a disguise he could preserve a strict incognito with a view to which he also left juno behind recommending her to the vigilant attentions of the waiter | chapter xv | which contains a play within a play | all the world was astonished when from the door of the double barrelled gun a man stepped forth on the hottest day in august arrayed as for a siberian winter in a dreadnought guarded with furs and a hat pressed down so as almost to cover his face | the train of curious persons who attended his motions naturally grew larger at every step | whosoever had hitherto doubted whether this man were mad doubted no longer when he was seen to enter the theatre where in the lightest summer clothing the heat was scarcely supportable | within the theatre the attention of all people was directed so undividedly upon himself that even mr schnackenberger began to opine that he had undertaken something extraordinary: so much the more thought he will it be prudent to hide my face that i may not again compromise my dignity in the presence of her highness | but this concealment of his face raised the strongest suspicions against him | throughout the whole house pit boxes and galleries there was but one subject of conversation viz | the man in the dreadnought and whilst in all other parts the house was crowded to excess upon his bench no soul would sit: and he created as much superfluity of room as he had found at the golden sow | at length the manager waited upon him and requested that he would either retire from the theatre or that he would explain what could have induced him to make his appearance in a costume which had spread alarm and anxiety through the public mind and which was likely to do a serious injury to the receipts of the night | at this moment several children began to cry taking him for black 25 robert | the consequence was that as they could not be pacified the first scene was mere dumb show to the audience and some giddy young people set up a loud 'off off dreadnought '| which cry was instantly seconded by the public | nevertheless as the princess at that instant entered her box mr schnackenberger however hard pressed thought it became him to maintain his post to the last extremity | this extremity forthwith appeared in the shape of three armed soldiers who on behalf of the police took him into custody | possibly mr jeremiah might have shown himself less tractable to the requests of these superannuated antiquities but for two considerations first that an opportunity might thus offer of exchanging his dreadnought for a less impressive costume and secondly that in case of his declining to accompany them he saw signs abroad that a generous and enlightened public did very probably purpose to kick him out a conjecture which was considerably strengthened by the universal applause which attended his exit at quick time |  25 in the original knecht rupert | the allusion is to an old christmas usage of north germany: a person comes in disguise in the character of an ambassador from heaven with presents for all the young children who are reported to him as good and obedient: but those who are naughty he threatens and admonishes | see coleridge's friend vol |ii p 322  mr schnackenberger was escorted by an immense retinue of old street padders and youthful mud larks to the city gaol | his own view of the case was that the public had been guilty of a row and ought to be arrested | but the old mayor who was half deaf comprehended not a syllable of what he said: all his remonstrances about 'pressing business' went for nothing: and when he made a show of escaping upon seeing the gloomy hole into which he was now handed his worship threatened him with drawing out the city guard | from one of this respectable body who brought him straw to lie upon and the wretched prison allowance of food he learned that his examination could not take place that day nor even the next for the next was a holiday on which mr mayor never did any business | on receiving this dolorous information mr schnackenberger's first impulse was to knock down his informant and run away: but a moment's consideration satisfied him that though he might by this means escape from his cell he could have no chance of forcing the prison gates | chapter xvi | in what way mr jeremiah escapes and what he finds in the street | a most beautiful moonlight began at this juncture to throw its beams in the prison when mr schnackenberger starting up from his sleepless couch for pure rage seized upon the iron bars of his window and shook them with a fervent prayer that instead of bars it had pleased god to put mr mayor within his grasp | to his infinite astonishment the bars were more obedient to his wrath than could have been expected | one shake more and like a row of carious teeth they were all in mr schnackenberger's hand | it may be supposed that mr schnackenberger lost no time in using his good fortune indeed a very slight jump would suffice to place him at liberty | accordingly when the sentinel had retired to a little distance he flung his dreadnought out of the window leaped upon it and stood without injury on the outside of the prison | 'who goes there '| cried the alarmed sentinel coyly approaching the spot from which the noise issued | 'nobody ' said the fugitive: and by way of answer to the challenge 'speak or i must fire' which tremulously issued from the lips of the city hero mr schnackenberger gathering up his dreadnought to his breast said in a hollow voice 'fellow thou art a dead man '| straightway the armed man fell upon his knees before him and cried out 'ah | gracious sir | have mercy upon me | i am a poor wig maker and a bad trade it is and i petitioned his worship and have done for this many a year to be taken into the city guard and yesterday i passed ' 'passed what '| 'passed my examination your honour: his worship put me through the manual exercise: and i was 'triculated into the corps | it would be a sad thing your honour to lose my life the very next day after i was 'triculated '| 'well ' said mr jeremiah who with much ado forbore laughing immoderately 'for this once i shall spare your life: but then remember not a word no sound or syllable '| 'not one your honour i vow to heaven '| 'and down upon the spot deliver me your coat side arms and hat '| but the martial wig maker protested that being already ill of a cold he should without all doubt perish if he were to keep guard in his shirt sleeves | 'well in that case this dreadnought will be a capital article: allow me to prescribe it it's an excellent sudorific '| necessity has no law: and so to save his life the city hero after some little struggle submitted to this unusual exchange | 'very good '| said mr schnackenberger as the warrior in the dreadnought after mounting his round hat again shouldered his musket: 'now good night ' and so saying he hastened off to the residence of the mayor | chapter xvii | mr jeremiah's night interview with the mayor upon state affairs | 'saints in heaven | is this the messenger of the last day '| screamed out a female voice as the doorbell rang out a furious alarum peal upon peal under that able performer mr jeremiah schnackenberger | she hastened to open the door but when she beheld a soldier in the state uniform she assured him it was all over with him for his worship was gone to bed and when that was the case he never allowed of any disturbance without making an example | 'aye but i come upon state business '| 'no matter ' said the old woman 'it's all one: when his worship sleeps business must sleep: that's the law i'll assure you and has been any time since i can think on | he always commits at the least '| 'very likely but i must speak to him '| 'well then take the consequences on yourself ' said she: 'recollect you're a state soldier you'll be brought to a court martial you'll be shot '|'ah  well: that's my concern '| 'mighty well ' said the old woman: 'one may as well speak to the wind | however i'll get out the way: i'll not come near the hurricane | and don't you say i didn't warn you '| so saying she let him up to her master's bed room door and then trotted off as fast and as far as she could | at this moment mr mayor already wakened and discomposed by the violent tintinnabulation rushed out: 'what '| said he 'am i awake | is it a guardsman that has this audacity '| 'no guardsman mr mayor ' said our hero in whose face his worship was vainly poring with the lamp to spell out the features of some one amongst the twelve members of the state guard 'no guardsman but a gentleman that was apprehended last night at the theatre '| 'ah '| said the mayor trembling in every limb 'a prisoner and escaped | and perhaps has murdered the guard what would you have of me me a poor helpless unfortunate man '| and at every word he spoke he continued to step back towards a bell that lay upon the table | 'basta ' said mr schnackenberger taking the bell out of his hands |'mr  mayor i'm just the man in the dreadnought | and i've a question to ask you mr mayor and i thought it was rather long to wait until morning so i took the liberty of coming for an answer to night and i'd think myself particularly obliged to you for it now: upon what authority do you conceive yourself entitled to commit me an innocent man and without a hearing to an abominable hole of a dungeon | i have not murdered the guard mr mayor: but i troubled him for his regimental coat that i might gain admittance to your worship: and i left him the dreadnought in exchange '| 'the dreadnought '| said the mayor | 'aye: now this very dreadnought it was sir that compelled me making a low bow to issue my warrant for your apprehension '| and it then came out that in a list of stolen goods recently lodged with the magistrates a dreadnought was particularly noticed: and mr mayor having seen a man enter the theatre in an article answering to the description and easily identified by a black cross embroidered upon the back was obliged by his duty to have him arrested more especially as the wearer had increased the suspicion against himself by concealing his face | this explanation naturally reconciled mr schnackenberger to the arrest: and as to the filthy dungeon that admitted of a still simpler apology as it seemed that the town afforded no better | 'why then mr mayor as things stand it seems to me that in the point of honour i ought to be satisfied: and in that case i still consider myself your prisoner and shall take up my quarters for this night in your respectable mansion '| 'but no '| thought mr mayor: 'better let a rogue escape than keep a man within my doors that may commit a murder on my body '| so he assured mr schnackenberger that he had accounted in the most satisfactory manner for being found in possession of the dreadnought took down the name of the old clothesman from whom it was hired and lighting down his now discharged prisoner he declared with a rueful attempt at smiling that it gave him the liveliest gratification on so disagreeable an occasion to have made so very agreeable an acquaintance | chapter xviii | misery acquaints mr schnackenberger with strange bedfellows | when mr schnackenberger returned home from his persecutions he found the door of the double barrelled gun standing wide open: and as he had observed a light in his own room he walked right up stairs without disturbing the sleeping waiter | but to his great astonishment two gigantic fellows were posted outside the door who upon his affirming that he must be allowed to enter his own room seemed in some foreign and unintelligible language to support the negative of that proposition | without further scruple or regard to their menacing gestures he pressed forwards to the chamber door but immediately after felt himself laid hold of by the two fellows one at his legs the other at his head and spite of his most indignant protests carried down stairs into the yard | there he was tumbled into a little d p t for certain four footed animals with whose golden representative he had so recently formed an acquaintance no less intimate and the height of the building not allowing of his standing upright he was disposed to look back with sorrow to the paradise lost of his station upon the back of the quiet animal whom he had ridden on the preceding day | even the dungeon appeared an elysium in comparison with his present lodgings where he felt the truth of the proverb brought home to him that it is better to be alone than in bad company | unfortunately the door being fastened on the outside there remained nothing else for him to do than to draw people to the spot by a vehement howling | but the swine being disturbed by this unusual outcry and a general uproar taking place among the inhabitants of the stye mr schnackenberger's single voice suffocated by rage was over powered by the swinish accompaniment | some little attention was however drawn to the noise amongst those who slept near to the yard: but on the waiter's assuring them that it was 'only a great pig who would soon be quiet ' that the key could not be found and no locksmith was in the way at that time of night the remonstrants were obliged to betake themselves to the same remedy of patience which by this time seemed to mr jeremiah also the sole remedy left to himself | chapter xix | whose end reconciles our hero with its beginning | mr schnackenberger's howling had as the waiter predicted gradually died away and he was grimly meditating on his own miseries to which he had now lost all hope of seeing an end before daylight when the sudden rattling of a key at the yard door awakened flattering hopes in his breast | it proved to be the waiter who came to make a gaol delivery and on letting him out said 'i am commissioned by the gentlemen to secure your silence ' at the same time putting into his hand a piece of gold | 'the d l take your gold '| said mr schnackenberger: 'is this the practice at your house first to abuse your guests and then have the audacity to offer them money '| 'lord protect us '| said the waiter now examining his face 'is it you | but who would ever have looked for you in such a dress as this | the gentlemen took you for one of the police |lord  to think what a trouble you'll have had '| and it now came out that a party of foreigners had pitched upon mr jeremiah's room as a convenient one for playing at hazard and some other forbidden games and to prevent all disturbance from the police had posted their servants who spoke not a word of german as sentinels at the door | 'but how came you to let my room for such a purpose '| 'because we never expected to see you to night we had heard that the gentleman in the dreadnought had been taken up at the theatre and committed | but the gentlemen are all gone now and the room's quite at your service '| mr schnackenberger however who had lost the first part of the night's sleep from suffering was destined to lose the second from pleasure: for the waiter now put into his hands the following billet: 'no doubt you must have waited for me to no purpose in the passages of the theatre: but alas | our firmest resolutions we have it not always in our power to execute and on this occasion i found it quite impossible consistently with decorum to separate myself from my attendants | will you therefore attend the hunt to morrow morning | there i hope a better opportunity will offer '| it added to his happiness on this occasion that the princess had manifestly not detected him as the man in the dreadnought | chapter xx | in which mr schnackenberger acts upon the ambitious feelings of a man in office for an amiable purpose | next morning when the provost marshal came to fetch back the appointments of the military wig maker it struck our good natured student that he had very probably brought the poor fellow into an unpleasant scrape | he felt therefore called upon as a gentleman to wait upon the mayor and do his best to beg him off | in fact he arrived just in time: for all the arrangements were complete for demonstrating to the poor wig maker by an posteriori line of argument the importance of valour in his new employment | mr schnackenberger entreated the mayor to be lenient: courage he said was not every man's business: as a wig maker the prisoner could have had little practice in that virtue: the best of wigs were often made by cowards: 'and even as a soldier ' said he 'it's odds if there should be such another alarm for the next hundred years '| but all in vain: his judge was too much incensed: 'such a scandalous dereliction of duty '| said he 'no no: i must make an example of him '| hereupon mr jeremiah observed that wig makers were not the only people who sometimes failed in the point of courage: 'nay ' said he 'i have known even mayors who by no means shone in that department of duty: and in particular i am acquainted with some who would look exceedingly blue aye d lish blue indeed if a student whom i have the honour to know should take it into his head to bring before the public a little incident in which they figured embellished with wood cuts representing a retreat by forced marches towards a bell in the background '| mr mayor changed colour and pausing a little to think at length he said 'sir you are in the right every man has his weak moments | but it would be unhandsome to expose them to the scoffs of the public '| 'why yes upon certain conditions '| 'which conditions i comply with ' said his worship and forthwith he commuted the punishment for a reprimand and a short confinement | on these terms mr schnackenberger assured him of his entire silence with respect to all that had passed | chapter xxi | in which the hopes of two lovers are wrecked at once | 'beg your pardon sir are you mr | schnackenberger '| said a young man to our hero as he was riding out of the city gate | 'yes sir i'm the man what would you have with me '| and at the same time looking earnestly at him he remembered his face amongst the footmen on the birth night | 'at the forester's house about eleven o'clock ' whispered the man mysteriously | 'very good ' said mr schnackenberger nodding significantly and forthwith upon the wings of rapturous anticipation he flew to the place of rendezvous | hence many water systems entirely from different and even opposing

directions: to the south the ticino the maggia and the tosa and tocci who carry their waters are lake maggiore and then the main flow of the po | south west the rhone which will fill the great basin of lake geneva or geneva and runs its course in france to the gulf of lyon | to the west or aare aare which widened after the lakes of thun and brienz and bathing bern and solera or solothurn

region intermediate or low switzerland formed mainly by the cantons of vaud fribourg bern solera lucerne zug district in zurich aargau and thurgau consists as i said of undulating narrow and shallow

though very unequal in extent 9 of the second order and more than 60 of the third almost relatively to the first microscopic | almost all first class are navigated by steamboats and yachts some are only crossed by little boats or paddle canoes insignificant as many lacks any navigation | the multitude of lakes third order is in lofty mazes of the alps in the headwaters of the rivers or the bottom of the fridge | in the rear and standing upon the steps of the forester's house stood von pilsen and his party convulsed with laughter immediately below them was the whole body of the hunters who had called here for refreshment upon whose faces struggled a mixed expression of merriment and wonder: and at the head of the whole company stood a party of butchers and butchers' boys returning from the hunt whose fierce looks and gestures made it evident that they sympathized with the wrongs of mrs sweetbread the relict of a man who had done honour to their body and were prepared to avenge them in any way she might choose | she meantime whose whole mighty love was converted into mighty hatred by the opprobrious words and fierce repulse of mr schnackenberger called heaven and earth and all present to witness her wrongs protested that he had himself appointed the meeting at the forest house and in confirmation drew forth a letter | at sight of the letter a rattling peal of laughter from mr von pilsen left no room to doubt in our student's mind from whose witty manufactory it issued and a rattling peal of wrath from the butchers' boys left no room to doubt in anybody's mind what would be its consequences | the letter was in fact pretty much what mrs sweetbread alleged: it contained a large and unlimited offer of mr schnackenberger's large and unlimited person professed an ardour of passion which could brook no delay and entreated her to grant him an interview for the final arrangement of all preliminaries at the forest house | whilst this letter was reading mr schnackenberger perceived that there was no time to be lost: no juno unfortunately was present no 'deus ex machin ' to turn the scale of battle which would obviously be too unequal and in any result considering the quality of the assailants not very glorious | so watching his opportunity he vaulted into his saddle and shot off like an arrow | up went the roar of laughter from von pilsen and the hunters: up went the roar of fury from the butchers and their boys: in the twinkling of an eye all were giving chase showers of stones sang through the trees threats of vengeance were in his ears butchers' dogs were at his horse's heels butchers' curses were on the wind a widow's cries hung upon his flight | the hunters joined in the pursuit a second chase was before them mr pilsen had furnished them a second game | again did mr schnackenberger perspire exceedingly once again did mr schnackenberger 'funk' enormously yet once again did mr schnackenberger shiver at the remembrance of the golden sow and groan at the name of sweetbread | he retained however presence of mind enough to work away at his spurs incessantly nor ever once turned his head until he reached the city gates which he entered at the pas de charge thanking heaven that he was better mounted than on his first arrival at b | chapter xxii | it never rains but it pours | rapidly as mr schnackenberger drove through the gates he was arrested by the voice of the warder who cited him to instant attendance at the town hall | within the memory of man this was the first time that any business had been transacted on a holiday an extraordinary sitting was now being held and the prisoner under examination was juno |'oh  heaven and its mercies | when will my afflictions cease '| said the exhausted student 'when shall i have a respite '| respite there could be none at present for the case was urgent and unless juno could find good bail she was certain of being committed on three very serious charges of 1 trespass 2 assault and battery 3 stealing in a dwelling house | the case was briefly this: juno had opened so detestable an overture of howling on her master's departure for the forest that the people at the double barrelled gun out of mere consideration for the city of b had found it necessary to set her at liberty whereupon as if the devil drove her forthwith the brute had gone off in search of her old young enemy the kitten at the hotel of the princess | she beat up the kitten's quarters again and again she drove in the enemy pell mell into her camp in the kitchen | the young mistress of the kitten out of her wits at seeing her darling's danger had set down a pail of milk in which she was washing a brussels' veil and a quantity of mechlin lace belonging to the princess and hurried her kitten into a closet | in a moment she returned and found milk brussels' veil mechlin lace vanished evaporated into juno's throat 'abiit evasit excessit erupit '| only the milk pail upon some punctilio of delicacy in juno was still there and juno herself stood by complacently licking her milky lips and expressing a lively satisfaction with the texture of flanders' manufactures | the other lakes belong exclusively to the confederation |  the fact of being switzerland in the temperate zone while it has such high mountains of the most varied settings gives the unique advantage of having during the spring summer and autumn three elements of climacteric variety of vegetation and consequently industries customs etc | the stations produced under the latitude and developments the globe are constantly modified in switzerland more than any other country in europe by the influence of the heights and exposure of the sites | thus the territory switzerland has three simultaneous temperatures of the first order determined by the sun the height air and air currents descending from the icy mountains anchovies or narrow gorges | with the exception of fruits vegetables exclusive to the tropics grow the air in switzerland free all plants that can live from the lower area of the vineyards to the regions the north pole | i have seen flourish in the ground on the banks of lake leman orange pomegranates and other fruit trees and shrubs ostenian abundant in italy and spain | it is not therefore surprising that switzerland is so picturesque offering the most varied landscapes topography and vegetation from the deep valley and the undulating plain to the granite peaks completely black and sharp and the eternal snow domes which are lost in the abyss the atmosphere almost never trodden by man | if not' and then mr deputy paused for effect and struck the table with his fist 'if not and such principles of jacobinism and french philosophy are to be tolerated then i say there is an end to social order and religion: sansculotterie septemberising and red night caps will flourish over once happy europe and the last and best of kings and our most shining lights will follow into the same bottomless abyss which has already swallowed up and his voice faltered my liver '| 'lights and liver '| said mr schnackenberger 'i suppose you mean liver and lights but lord | mr recorder what a bilious view you take of the case | your liver weighs too much in this matter and where that happens a man's judgment is sure to be jaundiced '| however the council thought otherwise: mr deputy's speech had produced a deep impression and upon his motion they adjudged that in twelve hours juno should be conducted to the frontiers of the city lands and there solemnly outlawed: after which it should be free to all citizens of b to pursue her with fire and sword and even before that period if she were met without a responsible guide | mr schnackenberger pleaded earnestly for an extension of the armistice but then arose for the second time with catonic severity of aspect mr deputy recorder he urged so powerfully the necessity of uncompromising principle in these dangerous times insisted so cogently on the false humanity of misplaced lenity and wound up the whole by such a pathetic array of the crimes committed by juno of the sausages she had robbed the rabbits she had strangled the porcelain she had fractured the raspberry vinegar she had spilt the mutton she had devoted to chops 'her own chops remember ' said mr schnackenberger the brussels' veil and the mechlin lace which she had swallowed the domestic harmony which she had disturbed the laws of the land which she had insulted and outraged the peace of mind which she had invaded and finally said he 'as if all this were not enough the liver the goose's liver my liver my unoffending liver' 'and lights ' said mr schnackenberger 'which she has burglariously and inhumanly immolated to her brutal propensities:' on all this mr deputy executed such a bravura and the sins of juno chased each other so rapidly and assumed so scarlet a hue that the council instantly negatived her master's proposition the single dissentient voice being that of mr mayor who with tears in his eyes conjured mr schnackenberger not to confound the innocent with the guilty | chapter xxiii | in which misfortune empties her last vial upon the head of mr schnackenberger | exhausted by the misfortunes of the day towards evening mr jeremiah was reposing at his length and smoking in the window seat of his room | solemn clouds of smoke expressed the gloomy vapours which rested on his brain | the hours of juno's life it seemed to him were numbered every soul in b was her sworn foe bipeds and quadrupeds men women dogs cats children kittens deputy recorders rabbits cooks legs of mutton to say nothing of goose livers sausages haunches of venison and 'quilts '|  if he were to take country lodgings for her and to send her out of b what awaited her there | whither could she go but some butcher some butterwoman some rough rider or other had a private account to settle with her 'unhappy creature '| ejaculated the student 'torment of my life '| at this moment mr schnackenberger's anxious ruminations were further enforced by the appearance of the town crier under his window: inert as the town council were in giving effect to their own resolutions on this occasion it was clear that they viewed the matter as no joke and were bent on rigorously following up their sentence | for the crier proclaimed the decree by beat of drum explained the provisos of the twelve hours' truce and enjoined all good citizens and worthy patriots at the expiration of that period to put the public enemy to the sword wherever she should be found and even to rise en masse if that should be necessary for the extermination of the national robber as they valued their own private welfare or the honour and dignity of the state | 'english fiend '| said mr schnackenberger 'will nothing reclaim thee | now that i am rid of my german plague must i be martyred by my english plague '| for be it mentioned that on our hero's return from the council he had received some little comfort in his afflictions from hearing that mrs sweetbread had upon her return to b testified her satisfaction with the zealous leader of the butchers' boys by forthwith bestowing upon him her widowed hand and heart together with the sow and its appurtenances | 'english fiend '| resumed mr schnackenberger 'most edacious and audacious of quadrupeds | can nothing be done for thee | is it impossible to save thy life '| and again he stopped to ruminate | for her metaphysics it was hopeless to cure but could nothing be done for her physics | at the university of x she had lived two years next door neighbour to the professor of moral philosophy and had besides attended many of his lectures without any sort of benefit to her morals which still continued of the very worst description | 'but could no course of medical treatment ' thought her master 'correct her inextinguishable voracity | could not her pulse be lowered | might not her appetite or her courage be tamed | would a course of tonics be of service to her | suppose i were to take her to england to try the effect of her native air would any of the great english surgeons or physicians be able to prescribe for her effectually | would opium cure her | yet there was a case of bulimy at toulouse where the french surgeons caught the patient and saturated him with opium but it was of no use for he ate 26 as many children after it as before | would mr abernethy with his blue pill and his rufus pill be of any service to her | or the acid bath or the sulphate of zinc or the white oxide of bismuth or soda water | for perhaps her liver may be affected | but lord | what talk i of her liver | her liver's as sound as mine | it's her disposition that's in fault it's her moral principles that are relaxed and something must be done to brace them | let me consider '|  26 this man whose case i have read in some french medical memoirs was a desperate fellow: he cared no more for an ounce of opium than for a stone of beef or half a bushel of potatoes: all three would not have made him a breakfast | as to children he denied in the most tranquil manner that he ate them | ''pon my honour ' he sometimes said 'between ourselves i never do eat children '| however it was generally agreed that he was p dophagous or infantivorous | some said that he first drowned them whence i sometimes called him the p dobaptist | certain it is that wherever he appeared a sudden scarcity of children prevailed note of the translator | at this moment a cry of 'murder murder '| drew the student's eyes to the street below him and there to afflict his heart stood his graceless juno having just upset the servant of a cook's shop in the very act of rifling her basket the sound of the drum was yet ringing through the streets the crowd collected to hear it had not yet withdrawn from the spot and in this way was juno expressing her reverence for the proclamation of the town council of b | 'fiend of perdition '| said mr schnackenberger flinging his darling pipe at her head in the anguish of his wrath and hastening down to seize her | on arriving below however there lay his beautiful sea foam pipe in fragments upon the stones but juno had vanished to reappear no more in b | chapter xxiv | and set you down that in aleppo once othello | the first thing mr schnackenberger did was to draw his purse strings and indemnify the cook maid | the next thing mr schnackenberger did was to go into the public room of the gun call for a common pipe and seat himself growling in a corner of all possible privileges conferred by the laws the very least desirable is that of being created game: juno was now invested with that 'painful pre eminence ' she was solemnly proclaimed game: and all qualified persons i e every man woman and child were legally authorised to sink burn or destroy her | 'now then ' said mr schnackenberger to himself 'if such an event should happen if any kind soul should blow out the frail light of juno's life in what way am i to answer the matter to her purchaser mr fabian sebastian '| such were the thoughts which fumed away from the anxious mind of mr schnackenberger in surging volumes of smoke | together with the usual evening visitors of the public rooms at the gun were present also mr von pilsen and his party | above paths are just imperceptible variables grooves of torrents and landslides in the winter which follows the hunter in his bold excursions | finally if you want

the laughter of anticipation 'and set you down that in aleppo once when a fribble a coxcomb a puppy dared to traduce a student from the university of x i took the circumcised dog by the nose and smote him thus ' at the same time breaking his pipe calmly on the very prominent nose of mr von pilsen | inextinguishable laughter followed from all present: mr von pilsen quitted the room forthwith: and next morning was sought for in vain in b | chapter xxv | which contains a duel and a death | scarcely had mr schnackenberger withdrawn to his apartment when a pair of 'field pieces' were heard clattering up stairs such and so mighty as among all people that on earth do dwell no mortal wore himself only except and the student mr fabian sebastian | little had he thought under his evening canopy of smoke that nemesis was treading so closely upon his heels | 'sir my brother ' began mr student fabian 'the time is up: and here am i to claim my rights | where is the dog | the money is ready: deliver the article: and payment shall be made '| mr schnackenberger shrugged his shoulders | 'nay my brother no jesting if you please on such serious occasions: i demand my article '| 'what if the article have vanished '| 'vanished '| said mr fabian 'why then we must fight until it comes back again sir my brother you have acted nefariously enough in absconding with goods that you had sold: would you proceed to yet greater depths in nefariousness by now withholding from me my own article '| so saying mr fabian paid down the purchase money in hard gold upon the table | 'come now be easy ' said mr schnackenberger 'and hear me '| 'be easy do you say | that will i not: but hear i will and with all my heart provided it be nothing unhearable nor anything in question of my right to the article: else you know come knocks '| 'knocks '| said jeremiah: 'and since when i should be glad to know has the schnackenberger been in the habit of taking knocks without knocking again and paying a pretty large per centage '|'ah  very likely | that's your concern | as to me i speak only for myself and for my article '| hereupon mr schnackenberger made him acquainted with the circumstances which were so unpalatable to the purchaser of 'the article ' that he challenged mr schnackenberger to single combat there and then | 'come ' said mr fabian 'but first put up the purchase money: for i at least will practise nothing that is nefarious '| mr schnackenberger did so redeemed his sword from mrs sweetbread by settling her bill buckled it on and attended mr fabian to the neighbouring forest | being arrived at a spot suitable to their purpose and their swords drawn mr schnackenberger said 'upon my word it's a shocking thing that we must fight upon this argument: not but it's just what i have long expected | junonian quarrels i have had in my time 747 and a junonian duel is nothing more than i have foreseen for this last week | yet after all brother i give you my honour that the brute is not worth a duel: for fools as we have been in our rivalship about her between ourselves she is a mere agent of the fiend and minister of perdition to him who is so unhappy as to call her his '| 'like enough my brother haven't a doubt you're in the right for you know her best: still it would be nefarious in a high degree if our blades were to part without crossing each other | we must tilt a bit: sir my brother we must tilt | so lunge away at me and never fear but i'll lunge as fast as you '| so said so done: but scarce had mr sebastian pushed his first 'carte over the arm ' which was well parried by his antagonist when with a loud outcry in rushed juno and without troubling herself about the drawn swords she drove right at the pit of mr sebastian's stomach knocked the breath out of his body the sword out of his hand and himself upon his back |'ah  my goddess my juno '| cried mr schnackenberger 'nec vox hominem sonat oh dea certe '| 'nec vox hominem sonat '| said mr fabian rising: 'faith you're right there for i never heard a voice more like a brute's in my life '| 'down then down juno ' said mr schnackenberger as juno was preparing for a second campaign against mr fabian's stomach: mr fabian on his part held out his hand to his brother student saying 'all quarrels are now ended '| mr jeremiah accepted his hand cordially | mr fabian offered to resign 'the article ' however agitating to his feelings | mr jeremiah though no less agitated protested he should not | 'i will by all that's magnanimous ' said mr fabian | 'by the memory of curtius or whatever else is most sacred in self sacrifice you shall not ' said mr jeremiah | 'hear me thou light of day ' said mr fabian kneeling | 'hear me ' interrupted mr jeremiah kneeling also: yes the schnackenberger knelt but carefully and by circumstantial degree for he was big and heavy as a rhinoceros and afraid of capsizing and perspired freely | mr fabian kneeled like a dactyle: mr jeremiah kneeled like a spondee or rather like a molossus | juno meantime whose feelings were less affected did not kneel at all but like a tribrach amused herself with chasing a hare which just then crossed one of the forest ridings | a moment after was heard the report of a fowling piece | bitter presentiment of the truth caused the kneeling duelists to turn their heads at the same instant |alas  the subject of their high wrought contest was no more: english juno lay stretched in her blood | up started the 'dactyle ' up started the 'spondee ' out flew their swords curses dactylic and spondaic began to roll and the gemini of the university of x side by side strode after the junonicide who proved to be a forester | haven heard it calmly not looking surprised | then he made with his mouth about very special pampering | his answer was not long |  i'll tell you i have money but do not know if i have it | tomorrow will bring me some very fat accounts | the eyes gazed fixedly impertinent | rosalie wished that looked not so much and soon give him the money | after a pause that seemed to make studies refuge calculation on the brow of the bringas i say: what is money i have it you see | cajoncillo seemed stirred a sewing kit and background he brought a bunch of things | were rags thread limp and banknotes all forming a mass |  see you i do not lack |but  rosalia is ignited spirits when he saw the bills | but he was filled with darkness when the girl ordered sanchez to put money back into the deep and moving head said: ah i can not ma'am i can not | the pipa n thought thus: he wants this rascal is that i humble myself more i beg you and i begged and make a pot in front of her i want to drag their feet trample ah cochin sima if i was not like i am you know what you would do | well wake up the skirt and take a broom stick and fill of cardinals that promontory of meat have vast crazy what greater honor you want to pay money to someone like me | naturally none of this i thought the lady was told | on the contrary had to resort honeyed expressions and appropriate to the criticality of the case |  think about it child | maybe you can what you have to pay may be deferred for a few days while mine |  i only wish i the other with affected pity | i feel pretty go you empty handed the highly protective effect of this sentence rosalia humbled more than i was | would have taken by those so abundant hair to rub the snout on the ground |  could not make an effort said pulling out the intimate value of your chest |  what else would i |  i'm sad you can not help you | create sorry heartily | in some instances i am convinced that the compilers germans living in germany had a downright hoax put upon them by some facetious briton whom they had consulted what is given as the english equivalent for the german word being not seldom a pure coinage that never had any existence out of germany | other instances there are in which the words though not of foreign manufacture are almost as useless to the english student as if they were slang words i mean from the slang vocabulary current about the latter end of the seventeenth century | these must have been laboriously culled from the works of tom brown sir roger l'estrange echard jeremy collier and others from 1660 to 1700 who were the great masters of this vernacular english as it might emphatically be called with a reference to the primary 27 meaning of the word vernacular : and i verily believe that if any part of this slang has become or ever should become a dead language to the english critic his best guide to the recovery of its true meaning will be the german dictionaries of bailey arnold c in their earliest editions | by one of these the word potztausend a common german oath is translated to the best of my remembrance thus: 'udzooks udswiggers udswoggers bublikins boblikins splitterkins ' c and so on with a large choice of other elegant varieties | here i take it our friend the hoaxer had been at work: but the drollest example i have met with of their slang is in the following story told to me by mr coleridge | about the year 1794 a german recently imported into bristol had happened to hear of mrs x a wealthy widow | he thought it would be a good speculation to offer himself to the lady's notice as well qualified to 'succeed' to the late mr x and accordingly waited on the lady with that intention | having no great familiarity with english he provided himself with a copy of one of the dictionaries i have mentioned and on being announced to the lady he determined to open his proposal with this introductory sentence madam having heard that mr x late your husband is dead: but coming to the last word 'gestorben' dead he was at a loss for the english equivalent so hastily pulling out his dictionary a huge 8vo |  he turned to the word 'sterben ' to die and there found but what he found will be best collected from the dialogue which followed as reported by the lady: german | madam hahfing heard that mein herr x late your man is these words he kept chiming over as if to himself until he arrived at no | 1 of the interpretations of 'sterben ' when he roared out in high glee at his discovery is dat is has kicked de bucket |widow   with astonishment |  'kicked the bucket ' sir what german |ah  mein gott alway ich make mistake: i vou'd have said beginning again with the same solemnity of tone since dat mein herr x late your man hav hopped de twig which words he screamed out with delight certain that he had now hit the nail upon the head |widow  upon my word sir i am at a loss to understand you: 'kicked the bucket ' and 'hopped the twig '|german   perspiring with panic | ah madam | von two tree ten tousand pardon: vat sad wicket dictionary i haaf dat alway bring me in trouble: but now you shall hear and then recomposing himself solemnly for a third effort he began as before madam since i did hear or wash hearing dat mein herr x late your man haaf with a triumphant shout haaf i say gone to davy's locker 27 what i mean is this | vernacular from verna a slave born in his master's house |1  the homely idiomatic language in opposition to any mixed jargon or lingua franca spoken by an imported slave: 2 | hence generally the pure mother tongue as opposed to the same tongue corrupted by false refinement | by vernacular english therefore in the primary sense and i mean such homely english as is banished from books and polite conversation to billingsgate and wapping | further he would have gone but the widow could stand no more: this nautical phrase familiar to the streets of bristol allowed her no longer to misunderstand his meaning and she quitted the room in a tumult of laughter sending a servant to show her unfortunate suitor out of the house with his false friend the dictionary whose help he might perhaps invoke for the last time on making his exit in the curses 'udswoggers boblikins bublikins splitterkins '| n b | as test words for trying a modern german dictionary i will advise the student to look for the words beschwichtigen kulisse and mansarde | the last is originally french but the first is a true german word and on a question arising about its etymology at the house of a gentleman in edinburgh could not be found in any one out of five or six modern anglo german dictionaries | the end |richard clay sons limited
