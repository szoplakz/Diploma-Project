Chapter I

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENTS

Life on a cable-ship would be a lotus-eating dream were it not for the cable. But the cable,
like the Commissariat cam-u-el in Mr. Kipling's "Oonts," is--

    "--a devil an' a ostrich an' a orphan child in one."

Whether we are picking it up, or paying it out; whether it is lying inert, coil upon coil,
in the tanks like some great gorged anaconda, or gliding along the propelling machinery into
some other tank, or off into the sea at our bow or stern; whether the dynamometer shows its
tension to be great or small; whether we are grappling for it, or underrunning it; whether
it is a shore end to be landed, or a deep-sea splice to be made, the cable is sure to develop
most alarming symptoms, and some learned doctor must constantly sit in the testing-room, his
finger on the cable's pulse, taking its temperature from time to time as if it were a fractious
child with a bad attack of measles, the eruption in this case being faults or breaks or leakages
or kinks.

The difficulty discovered, it must be localized. A hush falls over the ship. Down to the testing
room go the experts. Seconds, minutes, hours crawl by. At last some one leaves the consultation
for a brief space, frowning heavily and apparently deep in thought. No one dares address him,
or ask the questions all are longing to have answered, and when his lips move silently we know
that he is muttering over galvanometer readings to himself. During this time everyone talks
in whispers, and not always intelligently, of the electrostatic capacity of the cable, absolute
resistances, and the coefficients of correction, while the youngest member of the expedition
neglects her beloved poodle, sonorously yclept "Snobbles," and no longer hangs him head downward
over the ship's rail.

At last the fault is discovered, cut out, and a splice made, the tests showing the cable as
good as new, whereupon the women return to their chiffons, the child to her games, and the
men, not on duty, to their cigars, until the cessation of noise from the cable machinery, or
the engine-room bell signalling "full speed astern" warns us something else may be amiss.

In the testing room, that Holy of Holies on board a cable-ship, the fate of the Burnside hangs
upon a tiny, quivering spark of light thrown upon the scale by the galvanometer's mirror. If
this light jumps from side to side, or trembles nervously, or perhaps disappears entirely from
the scale, our experts know the cable needs attention, and perhaps the ship will have to stop
for hours at a time until the fault is located. If the trouble is not in the tanks, the paying-out
machinery must be metamorphosed into a picking-up apparatus, and the cable already laid will
be coiled back into the hold until the fault appears, when it will be cut out and the two ends
of cable spliced. After this splice grows quite cool, tests are taken, and if they prove satisfactory,
we again resume our paying out, knowing that while the spot of light on the galvanometer remains
quietly in one position, the cable being laid is electrically sound, and we can proceed without
interruption.

As may be imagined everyone on the ship got to think in megohms, and scientific terms clung
to our conversation just as the tar from the cable tanks clung to our wearing apparel, while
few among us but had wild nightmares wherein the cable became a sentient thing, and made faces
at us as it leapt overboard in a continuous suicidal frenzy.

The cable-ship Burnside, as some may remember, was one of the first prizes captured in the
Spanish War. She had been a Spanish merchant ship, the Rita, trading between Spain and all
Spanish ports in the West Indies, and when captured by the Yale, early in April, 1898, was
on her way to Havana with a cargo of goods. There is little about her now, however, to suggest
a Spanish coaster, save the old bell marked "Rita" in front of the captain's cabin. The sight
of this bell always brings to mind the wild patriotism of those early days of our war with
Spain, when love of country was grown to an absorbing passion which made one eager to surrender
all for the nation's honour, and stifled dread of impending separation--a separation that might
be forever--despite the rebel heart's fierce protest. The Rita's bell reminds one also of a
country less fortunate than our own, and sometimes when looking at it, one can almost fancy
the terror and excitement of those aboard the Spanish coaster when the Yale swept down upon
her on that memorable April afternoon. But it is a far cry from that day to this, and the Burnside,
manned by American sailors, flying Old Glory where once waved the red and yellow of Spain's
insignia, and laying American cable in American waters, is a very different ship from the Rita,
fleeing before her pursuers in the West Indies.

When the Burnside left Manila on December 23, 1900, for the cable laying expedition in the
far South Seas, there were eight army officers aboard, six of whom belonged to the Signal Corps,
the seventh being a young doctor, and the eighth a major and quartermaster in charge of the
transport. Besides these there were civilian cable experts, Signal Corps soldiers, Hospital
Corps men, Signal Corps natives, and the ship's officers, crew, and servants. The only passengers
on the trip were women, two and a half of us, the fraction standing for a young person of nine
summers, the quartermaster's little daughter, whom we shall dub Half-a-Woman, letting eighteen
represent the unit of grown-up value.

Half-a-Woman was the queen of the ship, and held her court quite royally from the Powers-that-Be,
our commanding officer, down to the roughest old salt in the forecastle. Having a child aboard
gave the only real touch of Christmas to our tropical pretence of it. Everything else was lacking--the
snow, the tree, the holly and wreaths, the Christmas carol, the dear ones so far away--but
the little child was with us, and wherever children are there also will the Christmas spirit
come, even though the thermometer registers ninety in the shade, and at the close of that long
summer-hot day we all felt more than "richer by one mocking Christmas past."

Half-a-Woman was also obliging enough to have a birthday on the trip, which we celebrated by
a dinner in her honour, a very fine dinner which opened with clear turtle soup and ended with
her favourite ice and a birthday cake of gigantic proportions, decorated with ornate chocolate
roses and tiny incandescent lamps in place of the conventional age-enumerating candles, cable-ship
birthday cakes being eminently scientific and up-to-date. Other people may have had birthdays
en route, for we were away from Manila many weeks, but none were acknowledged; modesty doubtless
constraining those older than Half-a-Woman from making a too ostentatious display of tell-tale
incandescent lights.

It was a very busy trip, everyone on the ship being occupied, with the exception of the women
who spent most of their time under the cool blue awning of the quarter-deck, where many a letter
was written, and many a book read aloud and discussed, though more often we accomplished little,
preferring to lie back in our long steamer chairs and watch the wooded islands with cloud shadows
on their shaggy breasts drift slowly by and fade into the purple distance.

Now we would pass close to some luxuriantly overgrown shore where tall cocoanut-palms marched
in endless procession along the white beach; now past hills where groups of bamboos swung back
and forth in the warm breeze, and feathery palms and plantains, the sunlight flickering through
their leaves, showed myriad tints of green and gold and misty gray; these in turn giving place
to some volcanic mountain, bare and desolate. Then for hours there would be no land at all,
only the wonderful horizonless blue of water and sky, the sunlight on the waves so dazzlingly
bright as to hurt the eyes.

But nearly always in this thickly islanded sea there was land, either on one side or the other,
land bearing strange names redolent of tropic richness, over whose pronunciation we would lazily
disagree. Perhaps it would be but a cliff-bound coast or a group of barren islands in the distance,
bluer even than the skies above them; perhaps some lofty mountain on whose ridges the white
clouds lay like drifted snow; or perhaps a tier of forest-grown hills, rising one above the
other, those nearest the water clothed in countless shades of green, verging from deepest olive
to the tender tint of newly awakened buds in the springtime, those farthest away blue or violet
against the horizon.

Golden days these were when Time himself grew young again, and, resting on his scythe, dreamed
the sunlit hours away. Until eventide the summer skies above us slept, as did the summer seas
below us, when both awakened from their slumbers flushed and rosy. On some evenings the heavy
white clouds piled high in the west seemed to catch fire, the red blaze spreading over the
heavens, to be reflected later in the mirror-like water of the sea. Then the crimson light
would gradually change to amethyst and gold, with the sun hanging like a ball of flame between
heaven and earth, while every conceivable colour, or combination of colours, played riotously
over all in the kaleidoscopic shifting of the clouds. At last the sun would touch the horizon,
sinking lower and lower into the sea, while the heavens lost their glory, taking on pale tints
of purple and violet. A moment more and the swift darkness of the tropics would blot out every
vestige of colour, for there is no twilight in the Philippines, no half-tones between the dazzling
tropic sunset and the dusky tropic night.

Then there were other evenings when the colours lying in distinct strata looked not unlike
celestial pousse-cafés, or perhaps some delicately blended shades of pink and blue and mauve,
suggested to a feminine mind creations of millinery art; or yet again, when a sky that had
been gray and sober all day suddenly blazed out into crimson and gold at sunset, one was irresistibly
reminded of a "Quakeress grown worldly."

And then would come the night and the wonderful starlit heavens of the tropics--

                           "--unfathom'd, untrod,
    Save by even' and morn and the angels of God."

Every star sent a trail of light to the still water, seeming to fasten the sky to the sea with
long silver skewers; wonderful phosphorescence played about beneath us like wraiths of drowned
men luring one to destruction; while in the musical lap of the water against the ship's side
one almost fancied the sound of Lorelei's singing. And then there were starless nights with
only a red moon to shine through cloudy skies; and nights no less beautiful when all the world
seemed shrouded in black velvet, when the dusky sea parted silently to let the boat pass through,
and then closed behind it with no laugh or ripple of water to speed it onward, breathlessly
still nights of fathomless darkness. The ship's master, burdened with visions of coral reefs
on a chartless coast, failed to appreciate the æsthetic beauty of sailing unknown seas in limitless
darkness, and either anchored on such nights, or paced back and forth upon his bridge, longing
for electric lighted heavens that would not play him such scurvy tricks.

And there were gray days, too, which only served to make more golden the sun-kissed ones; days
when no observations could be taken with the sextant, to the huge disgust of the officer in
charge of such work; days when the distant mountains loomed spectre-like through the mist,
their sharp outlines vignetted into the sky. Occasionally the fog would lift a bit, just enough
to reveal the rain-drenched islands around us, and then suddenly wipe them out of existence
again, leaving the ship alone on a gray and shoreless sea.

As for amusements, these were not lacking, what with reading, writing, bag-punching, and playing
games with the small girl while under way; and when at anchor there was always shooting, hunting,
and fishing for the men, and for us all swimming off the ship's side. This last was often done
in shark-ridden waters, to the great disapproval of the ship's officers, some of whom would
stand on the well-deck, revolver in hand, while more than once a swift bullet was sent shrilling
over our heads at some great fin rising out of the sea beyond. On our trip to and from Bongao,
one of the Tawi Tawi Islands, on a wrecking expedition to save the launch Maud, stranded there
on a coral reef, all the Signal Corps officers were at liberty, too, which made life on the
ship even more agreeable, the delightful experience being again repeated on our return trip
to Manila from Pasacao, Luzon.

When one considers that the ship laid approximately five hundred knots of cable, and travelled
over three thousand knots on the trip, which does not include the Bongao wrecking expedition,
it will be seen how difficult the work was, in that in every instance, save from Zamboanga,
Mindanao, to Sulu, on the island of Sulu, we had to make a preliminary trip, sounding and taking
observations, before the cable could be laid, the Spanish charts being worse than unreliable.
Then, too, a government transport dragged our cable with her anchor at one place, a fierce
tropical storm wrecked it at another, while careless Moro trench diggers bruised it with stones
at a third, which meant many extra days of work for the Signal Corps at each of these places,
and for us idle ones a continuation of pleasant experiences, the whole trip taking in all three
and a half months.

Three and a half months of ideal summer weather from the last of December to the middle of
April, and real summer weather at that, not the sham midwinter summer of the tourist who has
his photograph taken attired in flannels and standing under a palm-tree in California, Florida,
or the Mediterranean, only to shiveringly resume his normal attire as soon as possible. The
Philippine winter climate is quite different, what some one has defined as the climate of heaven,
warmth without heat and coolness without cold, when men sport linen or khaki continuously,
and women wear lawns and organdies throughout the season, with a light wrap added thereto at
night--if it chances to be becoming.

In a few years it will be to these southern seas that the millionaire brings his yacht for
a winter cruise; it will be in these forests that he hunts for wild boar and deer, or shoots
woodcock, duck, snipe, pigeons, and pheasants; in these waters that he fishes for the iridescent
silver beauties that here abound. It will be on these sunlit shores invalids seeking health
will find it, and here that huge sanitariums should be built, for despite the tales of pessimistic
travellers, no lovelier climate exists than can be found in Philippine coast towns from the
middle of November until the last of March. After that it becomes unbearably hot, and then
one is in danger of all kinds of fevers or digestive troubles, and should, if possible, go
to Japan to get cooled off.

Of course, even during the Garden-of-Eden months, one must take the same care of himself that
he would in any country, and most of the travellers who write against the Philippine climate
have, according to their own statements, lived most unhealthfully as regarded diet, shelter,
exposure, and the like. During the hot season itself one can get along very comfortably in
the Philippines, if he makes it a rule to live just as he would at home, only at half speed,
if I may so express it.

But aside from its possibilities for the leisure class, what a world of interest the Philippines
has in store for us from a governmental and commercial standpoint! What a treasure-trove it
will prove to the historian, geographer, antiquarian, naturalist, geologist and ethnologist.
At every stopping-place my little note-book was filled with statistics as to trade in hemp,
cane-sugar, cocao, rice, copra, tobacco, and the like. I even had a hint here and there as
to the geology of the group, but ruthlessly blue-pencilled out such bits of useful information,
and while it may not be at all utilitarian, rejoice that I have been privileged to see these
islands in a state of nature, before the engineer has honeycombed the virgin forest with iron
rails; before the great heart of the hills is torn open for the gold, or coal, or iron to be
found there; before the primitive plough, buffalo, and half-dressed native give way to the
latest type of steam or electric apparatus for farming; before the picturesque girls pounding
rice in wooden mortars step aside for noisy mills; before the electric light frightens away
the tropic stars, and dims the lantern hanging from the gable of every nipa shack; before banking
houses do away with the cocoanut into which thrifty natives drop their money, coin by coin,
through a slit in the top; before the sunlit stillness of these coast towns is marred by the
jar and grind of factory machinery; before the child country is grown too old and too worldly-wise.

Chapter II

DUMAGUETE

Our first stopping place after a two days' trip from Manila was Dumaguete, on the southeast
corner of the island of Negros. We reached there at seven o'clock on Christmas morning, and
found it a tropically picturesque little town, surrounded by forest-grown hills, and built
mostly of nipa, with the exception of the church, convento, watch-tower, and tribunal, which
were of wood painted a dazzling white.

All day long men and boys, innocent of even an excuse for clothes, hovered about the ship in
bancas or dugouts, chattering volubly with each other in Visayan, or begging us in broken Spanish
to throw down coins that they might exhibit their natatorial accomplishments, and, when we
finally yielded, diving with yells of delight for the bits of silver, seeming quite as much
pleased, however, with chocolates wrapped in tin-foil as they had been with the money, and
uttering shrill cries that sounded profanely like "Dam'me--dam'me," to attract our attention.

When a coin was thrown overboard every one dived for it with becoming unanimity, and the water
being very clear, we could see their frog-like motions as they swam downward after the vanishing
prize, and the good-natured scuffle under water for its possession. Laughing, sputtering, coughing,
they would come to the surface, shaking the water out of their bright eyes like so many cocker
spaniels, the sun gleaming on their brown skins, their white teeth shining, as they pointed
out the complacent victor, who would hold the money up that we might see it, before they would
again begin their clamour of "Dam'me--dam'me," and go through a pantomime of how quickly each
personally would dive and bring it up, did we throw our donation in his direction.

When the supply of coins and candies had been exhausted, some one bethought him of throwing
chunks of ice overboard, and as none among the natives had ever seen ice before, their amazement
may well be imagined. The first boy to pick up a piece of the glittering whiteness let it drop
with a howl, and when he caught his breath again warned the others in shrill staccato tones
that he had been burned, that it was hot, muy caliente, wringing his hands as if, indeed, they
had been scorched. Presently, finding that the burn left no mark and had stopped hurting, he
shamefacedly picked up the ice again, shifting it from one hand to the other with the utmost
rapidity, and occasionally crossing himself in the interim.

Meanwhile more ice had been thrown overboard, and the rest of the natives, not at all deterred
by their comrade's warning, examined the strange substance for themselves. Very excited were
their comments, those in the far bancas scrambling over the intervening boats to see with their
own eyes the miracle of hard water so cold that it was hot. They smelled and tasted of it,
like so many monkeys, chattering excitedly the while, and they rubbed it on each other's bare
backs amid screams of genuine fright, while many tumbled overboard to escape the horrible sensation
of having it touch their flesh, the superstitious being reminded, no doubt, of all the tales
the padres had ever told them of hell or purgatory.

Some thrifty and unimaginative souls tied up their bits of ice in cloths or packed them in
small boxes, to take back to the village, while others, engrossed in their examination of the
strange substance, transferred it from one hand to the other until, miracle of miracles, it
had entirely disappeared. Others, emulating the laughing people on the big boat, put their
pieces of ice into their mouths, but not for long at a time, as the intense cold made their
teeth ache; while still others piously crossed themselves and refused to have aught to do with
so manifest an invention of the Evil One.

Meanwhile, despite the fact of its being Christmas, the Signal Corps officers, men, and natives
were hard at work establishing an office in the town, digging a trench for the shore end of
the cable, and setting up the cable hut, packed in sections for convenience in transportation.
Thirty Dumaguete natives were employed at twenty-five cents a day to help dig the trench and
put up the hut, and they seemed very willing in their work and thought the remuneration princely.

So heavy was the surf in the early morning that the officers and soldiers going ashore had
to be carried from the rowboats to the beach on the backs of natives, but it fortunately calmed
down enough before we women went over in the afternoon to allow of our entering Dumaguete in
a more conventional manner.

Being a fiesta, the town was full of natives from the provinces, all smartly dressed and all
beaming with good-natured curiosity at the advent of two and a half American women,--the only
Americanas most of them had ever seen,--and quite an escort gathered around us as, accompanied
by the officers of the post and those from the ship not otherwise engaged, we walked down the
dusty streets toward the cockpits, where in honour of the day there was to be a contest of
unusual interest. At every corner came new recruits to swell the ranks of our followers. "Merry
Christmas," cried everyone in Spanish or Visayan, and "Merry Christmas" we responded, though
June skies bending down toward tropical palms and soft winds just rustling the tops of tall
bamboos, so that they cast flickering fern-like shadows over thatched nipa roofs, but ill suggested
Christmas to an American mind.

The cockpit reached, we found it to be a rudely built circular shack of nipa, fairly crowded
with natives in gala attire, and a sprinkling of khaki-clad soldiers from the post. Native
policemen, in uniforms that strongly reminded one of the insurrecto insignia, showed us to
our seats, and a few moments after our arrival two fine cocks, matched as nearly as possible
in strength and weight, were brought into the ring by their respective owners, while the onlookers
discussed the birds' relative points. The two cocks, still held by their masters, were then
allowed to peck at each other's combs until fully angered, when they were put into the ring
a short distance apart, and while each owner held the tail feathers of his bird, the cocks
made futile efforts to reach each other, giving vent the while to derisive crowing.

The audience, after watching this performance a moment or two, began making their bets, both
individually and through the agency of the "farmer," who, standing in the centre of the ring,
cried out chaffingly in Visayan to faint-hearted gamesters. Then circles were drawn on the
earthen floor of the pit, and the money put up on each cock deposited in one or the other of
these rings. At the end of the fight some one appointed cried out the name of the victorious
bird, and the winners swarmed down into the pit where they collected their money and the original
stakes. There is never any cheating at such affairs, a sort of bolo morality existing among
the natives, and all is as methodical and well-behaved as the proverbial Sabbath school.

It was the first cock-fight most of us cable-ship people had ever seen, and it was hard to
understand the wild enthusiasm of the natives when, after unsheathing the steel gaffs on the
roosters' legs, the birds were allowed to make their preliminary dash at one another. For a
moment they walked around the ring with an excessively polite air, each keeping a wary lookout
on his antagonist, but frigidly impersonal and courteous. One might almost fancy them shaking
hands before the combat should begin, so ceremonious was their attitude. Then there would come
a simultaneous onslaught of feathered fury. Again and again they flew at one another, while
the volatile audience called out excitedly in Spanish, "The black wins--No, the speckled one's
ahead. Holy Virgin, give strength to the black!" In a very few moments one cock is either dead,
or perhaps turned coward before the cruel gaff of his opponent, and victor and vanquished leave
the arena to new combatants, while the clink of coin changing hands is heard throughout the
cockpit.

The first few fights we thought rather tame, and I, personally, had to assure myself over and
over as the bloody contestants were removed from the scene of action, that such a death was
no more painful and certainly far less ignominious than when chicken stewed or à la Maryland
was to be the ultimate result of the fowl's demise.

There was one little game-cock, however, who enthused even the most dispassionate among us.
He was small and wiry, and his well kept white feathers testified to a devoted master. How
impatient that absurd little rooster was for the fight to begin, and how he struggled to get
off his gaff and go into the fray unarmed, the weight on his legs seeming an impediment to
action, and how insolently he strutted and crowed before his antagonist, an equally well groomed
gentleman of exceptional manners, attired in a gorgeous suit of green and gold. But handsome
as the darker rooster was, the white one seemed to be the universal choice, and heavy were
the stakes in his favour, so heavy that when, after a few minutes' fighting, his wing was broken,
a general groan went up throughout the cockpit, a groan which merged into sullen silence when
the poor little chicken fell before the furious onslaught of his enemy.

Again and again the victorious green and gold rooster jumped upon his prostrate foe, pecking
now at his crop, now at his eyes, in a perfect frenzy of triumphant rage, the little white
fellow lying so still meanwhile that everyone thought him dead. But suddenly he struggled to
his feet, and, despite the grievously broken wing, whipped the big bully in a way to raise
a cheer even from the hitherto indifferent Americans.

As for the natives, they simply shouted themselves hoarse, and, contrary to all precedent,
jumped down into the pit, throwing their sombreros on high and yelling vigorously, "Muy valiente
gallo--muy valiente!" The little rascal had simply been sparring for wind, and he seemed to
wink an eye at us after having chased his vanquished enemy to a corner, for, like the coward
he was, the green and gold rooster turned tail and ran at the first opportunity.

It is to be hoped that the muy valiente gallo had his wing patched up and lived to tell his
tale of bravery to many a barn-yard chick--a war-scarred veteran whose honourable wound entitled
him to the respect of all domestic fowl. But knowing Filipino nature, I am rather inclined
to think that the white rooster made a very acceptable broth for his master on the following
day, the flesh of fighting-cocks being quite too tough for consumption in any other form.

On our return to the ship's boat we were accompanied to the water's edge by a juvenile contingent
of natives, some of them being our friends of the forenoon, who returned any notice of themselves
on our part by a rapturous gleam of teeth and eyes. One of them, a youngster of perhaps ten
or eleven, who gloried in the euphonious name of Gogo, was particularly assidious in his attentions,
and would come close up to us and say, "I-ese--i-ese--dam'me--i-ese!" going into paroxysms
of mirth the while, and wrinkling up his handsome little face at the mere remembrance of the
water so cold it was hard.

That night the shore officers took their Christmas dinner with us on the Burnside, and a very
jolly evening we made of it. The saloon was entirely covered, ceiling and all, by American
and ship's flags, interspersed with palms, while over the sideboard were suspended the American
flag and Union Jack intertwined, this last in honour of our two cable experts, both of them
being Britishers. We women donned our smartest frocks, the electric piano, slightly out of
tune, did rag-time to perfection, the menu included every conventional Christmas dish, and
yet--and yet it was not Christmas, and all the roast turkey and plum pudding in the world could
not make it so. It was a very jolly dinner, to be sure, well served and with charming company,
but it was not a Christmas dinner. Only Half-a-Woman's presence saved it and the day from utter
failure.

The next morning the presidente of the town, other officials, and some of the leading men and
women of Dumaguete made a visit to the ship, and were voluble in their surprise at what was
shown them,--the electric lights and fans, the steam galley and ice-machine; the cold-storage
room, where one could freeze to death in a few moments; the little buttons on the wall which
one had only to touch and a servant appeared to take one's orders; the wonderful piano that
"played itself,"--all were duly admired and exclaimed over.

But what seemed to please and astonish them most of all were the bath-rooms with their white
porcelain tubs, tiled floors, and shining silver knobs, which one had only to turn in order
to have hot or cold water, either salt or fresh, in the tub, the basin, or the shower. Even
the electric piano failed to impress them as did this aqueous marvel, and they crossed themselves
and called on the Virgin and all her angels to testify that verily the American nation was
a mighty one.

The men were of course greatly interested in our gallant armament of rapid-fire guns, and when
the quartermaster, who is a crack shot, hit an improvised target in the water several times
in succession with a one-pounder in the stern of the ship, the Filipinos were astounded, and
stared at him in even greater admiration than they had shown for the formidable little weapon.
Two shotguns of newest design were also brought on deck, and while the native women were frankly
bored at this display of ordnance and preferred to talk about the way our gowns were made,
the men were delighted, declaring they never imagined a gun could be broken in pieces and put
together again so easily.

Before our guests left, lemonade and cake were served on the quarter-deck, and it was really
amusing to watch their faces as they discussed the coldness of the drink, while the pieces
of ice in their glasses excited as much perturbation as the untutored savages had shown the
day before. One travelled lady, however, who had been to Iloilo once and tasted ice there,
drank her lemonade with ostentatious indifference to its temperature, as became one versed
in the ways of the world, explaining to me with condescension a few moments later that the
Iloilo ice had been much colder than ours,--an item of physical research which I accepted politely.

We women were asked innumerable questions as to our respective ages, the extent of our incomes,
our religious beliefs, and other inquiries of so personal a character as to be quite embarrassing.
They seemed, though, to be very genuine in their admiration of us, and evinced great interest
in our clothes, especially those of the quartermaster's wife, who, being a recent arrival in
the Philippines, had yet the enviable trail of the Parisian serpent upon her apparel. One heavy
cloth walking-skirt of hers, fitting smoothly over the hips and with no visible means by which
it could be got into, animated the same inquiry from these people as good King George is said
to have made anent the mystery of getting the apple into the dumpling, a problem of no little
difficulty, as any one will agree. At more than one stopping-place we were called upon to solve
the riddle of that skirt, and I verily believe that, being women, they were even more awed
at the thought of a garment fastening invisibly at one side of the front under a very deceptive
little pocket than at all the electrical marvels shown them on the ship.

While in Dumaguete we were driven around the town and far out into the country surrounding
it, finding everything much more tropical and luxuriant in growth than in Manila or its vicinity.
There were giant cocoanut-palms, looking not unlike the royal palm so often spoken of by travellers
on the Mediterranean, clusters of bamboo and groups of plantains, flowering shrubs and fields
of young rice, green as a well kept lawn at home.

Picturesque natives saluted us from the roadway, or from the windows of their nipa shacks;
naked brown children fled at our approach, and wakened their elders from afternoon siestas
that they might see two white women and a yellow-haired child drive by; carabao, wallowing
in the muddy water of a near-by stream, stared at us stolidly; fighting-cocks crowed lustily
as we passed; and hens barely escaped with their cackling lives from under our very wheels.

A native lazily pounding rice in a mortar rested from his appearance of labour and watched
the carriage until it became a mere speck in the distance. Two women beating clothes on the
rocks of a little stream stopped their gossip to peep at us shyly from under their brown hands.
Weavers of abaca left their looms and hung out of the windows to talk with their neighbours
about the great event. Heretofore they had thought the Americans were like Chinamen, who came
to the country, yes, and made money from it, but never settled down as did the Spaniards, never
brought their families with them and made the islands their home. But here were two American
women and a little girl--surely evidences of domesticity.

Everyone was friendly and peaceably disposed, everyone seemed glad to see us, if smiles and
hearty greetings carry weight, and there was apparently no race prejudice, no half-concealed
doubt or mistrust of us. Yet in a few days thereafter that very road became unsafe for an unarmed
American, while the people who had greeted us with such childlike confidence and delight were
preparing a warmer reception for the Americans under the able leadership of a Cebu villain,
who had incited them to insurrection by playing upon their so-called religious belief, this
in many instances being merely fetishism of the worst kind.

This instigator of anarchy boasted an anting-anting, a charm against bullets and a guarantee
of ultimate success in battle, which consisted of a white camisa, the native shirt, on which
was written in Latin a chapter from the Gospel of St. Luke. But notwithstanding his anting-anting,
and the more potent factor of several hundred natives in his ranks, he was easily defeated
by a mere handful of soldiers from the little fort, and when last heard of by our ship was
lying in the American hospital at Dumaguete awaiting transportation to Guam. His former army
was mucho amigo to the Americans, and once again the pretty drives around Dumaguete were quite
safe, and once again the native, when passing an American, touched his hat and smilingly said
good day in Visayan, a greeting which sounds uncommonly like "Give me a hairpin."

On the evening of our second day in Dumaguete, the natives of the town gave a ball in honour
of the cable-ship, at the house of one of the leading citizens. There, on a floor made smoother
than glass with banana leaves, we danced far into the night to the frightfully quick music
of the Filipino orchestra. One would hardly recognize the waltz or two-step as performed by
the Visayan. He seems to take his exercise perpendicularly rather than horizontally, and after
galloping through the air with my first native partner, I felt equal to hurdle jumping or a
dash through paper hoops on the back of a milk-white circus charger.

Their rigadon, a square dance not unlike our lanciers, the Filipinos take very seriously, stepping
through it with all the unsmiling dignity of our grandparents in the minuet. The sides not
engaged in dancing always sit down between every figure and critically discuss those on the
floor, but while going through the evolutions of the dance, it seems to be very bad form to
either laugh or talk much, a point of etiquette I am afraid we Americans violated more than
once. Another very graceful dance, the name of which I have forgotten, consists of four couples
posturing to waltz time, changing from one partner to another as the dance progresses, and
finally waltzing off with the original one, the motion of clinking castanets at different parts
of the dance suggesting for it a Spanish origin.

At midnight a very attractive supper was served, to which the presidente escorted us with great
formality. As is customary, the women all sat down first, the men talking together in another
room and eagerly watching their chance to fill the vacant places as the women, one by one,
straggled away from the table. The supper consisted for the most part of European edibles,
but there were several Visayan delicacies as well, all of which I was brave enough to essay,
to the great delight of the native women, who jabbered recipes for the different dishes into
my ear, and pressed me to take a second helping of everything. All of them ate with their knives
and wiped their mouths on the edge of the table-cloth, having Spanish precedent for such customs,
and all were heartily and unaffectedly hungry after their violent exercise in the waltz and
two step.

It was very late when we finally left the baille, amidst much hand-shaking and many regrets
that our stay in Dumaguete was so short, while great wonder was shown by all that we should
be able to sail at daylight on the morrow, it seeming well-nigh incredible to the native mind
that so much could have been accomplished in so short a time; for, despite the fact that we
had been in Dumaguete less than two days, everything was completed--a marvel, indeed, when
one considers the tremendous current which made the landing of the shore end a hazardous proceeding.

To one who has never witnessed the difficulties of propelling a rowboat through the heavy breakers
of some of these Philippine coast towns, it would be hard to appreciate the struggles of the
Signal Corps to land shore ends at the different cable stations. More than once men were almost
drowned in its accomplishment but fortunately on the whole trip, despite many narrow escapes,
not a man was seriously injured in the performance of his duty. Once landed on the beach, the
shore end was laid in the trench dug for it, one end of the cable entering the cable hut through
a small hole in its flooring, where after some adjustment and much shifting of plugs and coaxing
of galvanometers, the ship way out in the bay was in communication with the land, through that
tiny place, scarce larger than a sentry-box, in which a man has barely room enough to turn around.

Each telegraph office, when finally established, looks for all the world like a neat housekeeper's
storeroom, with its shelf after shelf of batteries, all neatly labelled like glass jars of
jellies and jams. It positively made one's mouth water to see them, and only the rows of wires
on the wall, converging into the switchboard, and from thence to the operator's desk, where
the little telegraph instruments were so soon to click messages back and forth, could convince
one that the jars contained only "juice," as operators always call the electric current.

When this work on shore was completed, the ship paid out a mile and a half of cable, cut, and
buoyed it, awaiting our return from the next station, where, because of the inaccurate charts
already mentioned, it would be necessary to first take soundings before we could proceed to
lay the cable. These buoys, so large that they were facetiously called "men" by the punster
of the ship, are painted a brilliant scarlet, which makes them a conspicuous feature of the
sea-scape. Sometimes a flagstaff and a flag are fastened to the buoy, and often it is converted
for the ship's benefit info an extemporaneous lighthouse by the addition of an oil lamp attached
to its summit.

That night at Dumaguete the swift current unfortunately swung our ship's anchor past the buoy
to which the cable was attached, so that at daylight the next morning, instead of sailing for
Oroquieta, Mindanao, as we bad expected, the buoy was picked up and a half mile of cable cut
out, a new mile being spliced on in its place. When this was completed we paid out the fresh
cable, buoyed it, and started for Oroquieta, which was to have been our next cable landing,
stopping every five knots for soundings and observations.

One of the officers with the sextant ascertained the angle between two points on the coast,
while other men, under the generalship of one of the cable experts, took deep-sea soundings,
not only that the depth of the water might be known, but also its temperature and the character
of the bottom, so one could judge of its effect upon the cable when laid, every idiosyncrasy
of that cable being already a study of some import to the testing department.

This deep-sea sounding is a very necessary feature of cable laying, as unexpected depths of
water or unlooked for changes in submarine geography, when not taken into account, might prove
disastrous to the cable being laid. The sounding apparatus is of great interest, being a compact
little affair consisting of a small engine that with a self-acting brake helps regulate the
wire sounding-line as it is lowered into the water, and after sounding heaves it up again.
When this weight touches bottom the drum ceases to revolve, due to the automatic brake, and
the depth can be read off on the scale to one side of the apparatus. A cleverly devised little
attachment to the sinker brings up in its grasp a specimen of sea bottom, so that one can ascertain
if it be sand or rock, and whether or not it is suitable for cable laying.

The next day lingers in my memory as a profusely illustrated story, uneventful as to incident,
and bound in the blue of sea and sky, with gilt edges of sunshine. Before our five o'clock
breakfast we saw the "Cross hung low to the dawn," and at night, anchored near our last sounding,
fell asleep under the same Cross. The morning of the next day was but a repetition of the morning
before, even to the early rising, for at our breakfast hour the moon had not yet turned out
her light, nor were the stars a whit less brilliant than when we went to bed. "It's too early
for the morning to be well aired," one of our cable experts was wont to whimsically complain
at these daybreak gatherings, but by the time we had finished breakfast the night would have
whitened into dawn, and before most people were astir an incredible amount of work had been
accomplished by that little band of men, seemingly inured to fatigue and the loss of sleep.

All that morning on the way to Oroquieta the shore end of the cable was paid out of the tank
and coiled in the hold ready for instant use when we should reach our destination. The music
of the cable on the drum, the voice of some one in authority calling "Cobra--cobra," to the
natives in the tank, and their monotonous "Sigi do--sigi do," half-sung, half-chanted, seemed
an integral part of the day's beauty. Even the natives themselves, guiding the heavy, unwieldy,
treacherous cable round and round in the water-soaked tank, that only one turn should be lifted
at a time, grinned affably and perspiringly at those of us peering over the railing at them--grimy
tar-stained figures that they were, the sunlight bringing their faces out in strong relief
against the dark backgound.

That afternoon we anchored off Oroquieta, but the surf was so heavy that it was felt unsafe
to send one of the small boats ashore, especially as no one knew the location of the landing.
Strangely enough, no boats of any kind came out to the ship, not even a native banca, so that
our intercourse with Oroquieta was purely telescopic. Through our good lens we saw many a soldier,
field-glass in hand, looking wistfully in our direction. Other soldiers walked up and down
the beach on sentry duty, still others seemed to be standing guard over a small drove of horses
in a palm grove a little to the right of the principal buildings, while many more lounged lazily
on the broad steps of the church, or, leaning out of the windows of the tribunal, evidently
used as a barracks, stared stolidly at the strange ship in the harbour. That every man wore
side-arms seemed an indication the rebels were still rampant on the northern coast of Mindanao,
and the fact of numberless native boats passing by with a pharisaical lack of interest in our
presence spoke insurrection even more plainly.

Through the glass we all took turns in watching retreat, the little handful of khaki-clad men
standing at attention as the stars and stripes fluttered down the flagstaff. Oroquieta was
a lonely looking place, built entirely of nipa, with the exception of the inevitable white
church and convento, so we were not sorry when the Powers-that-Be decided it was a poor cable
landing, and gave orders for the ship to proceed to Misamis, Mindanao, on the following day.
Early next morning we weighed anchor, and, still taking soundings, arrived off Misamis about
ten o'clock, after a sail which one never could forget, as the coast of Mindanao is rarely
beautiful and much more tropical than anything we had seen even on the island of Negros.

Chapter III

MISAMIS

Long before reaching Misamis the old gray fort at the entrance of the town was picked out by
some one looking through the telescope, and many were the theories concerning it. At so great
a distance, and with the hot sunlight shining full upon it, the fort might have been a strip
of white sand; later it was decided to be a tribunal of unusual proportions, and at last when
it loomed full upon us in all the picturesqueness of its gray, moss-grown walls, with weeds
trailing in luxurious profusion from every crevice, we decided that there lived the American
inhabitants of Misamis. Soldiers gathered under the roof of the nearest watch-tower to observe
our entrance into the harbour, while still others, unmindful of the blazing sun, perched on
the top of the wall and swung their feet over the side, doubtless making numerous wagers as
to the transport's name and its business in so out of the way a place as Misamis.

Owing to the unreliability of the Spanish charts, the Burnside anchored some distance out of
the harbour, and just before tiffin a boat-load of officers from the garrison came out to the
ship, accompanied by the titular captain of the port, a young chap who also acted in several
other official capacities, a sort of military "crew, and the captain, too, and the mate of
the Nancy Bell." After tiffin the ship sailed into anchorage in the harbour of Misamis, half-way
around the old fort, which seemed to grow more picturesque with every turn, till finally we
could see the village of Misamis, almost hidden in a bewildering mass of tropical vegetation.
Our numerous theories to the contrary, the old fort was uninhabited, save by the ghosts of
other days, remaining but a grim relic of the time when Moro pirates swept terror to the hearts
of all coast villages south of Luzon. It was within those historic walls that the Signal Corps
decided to set up the cable-hut, and early the next morning two parties were sent ashore, one
to establish an office in the town, the other to superintend the digging of a trench by native
prisoners, just outside the walls of the old fort.

Among these distinguished gentlemen was a so-called colonel of the insurrecto army who had
been captured a short time before. The colonel posed as an aristocrat, whose hands had never
been soiled by labour, and when his companions in confinement were turned out to assist in
making way for liberty by means of the cable trench, he protested vigorously at the indignity,
and averred that he was not seeking the opportunity of reimbursing the American government
with pick and shovel for his enforced subsistence. He reiterated so often he was an officer
and a gentleman, that finally the American major in command at Misamis mildly replied that
self-appointed colonels in self-appointed armies were not recognized by any government, and
as for his gentility, if it were the genuine article and not a veneer like his title, it would
certainly stand the strain of a little honest labour. The arguments were cogent, and the hand
of the law more irresistible still, so the high ranking officer took his turn in the trench
with the other prisoners.

In the late afternoon we women went ashore and created even more of a sensation than we had
on the island of Negros. We were literally mobbed by natives anxious for a glimpse of the first
American women ever seen in that part of Mindanao, and we walked up to the Headquarters Building
with a chattering, crowding, admiring horde at our heels. There the officers held an informal
reception in our honour, to which all the socially possible of Misamis were invited, and the
native band serenaded us with such choice selections as "A Hot Time," and "After the Ball,"
decidedly off the key, to be sure, but with the best intentions in the world.

The Misamis women were charmed with their white sisters, and could no more conceal their artless
delight than so many children. They laughed and giggled nervously. They gesticulated as they
talked, and shrugged their pretty shoulders with a grace taught them by our Spanish predecessors.
They patted imaginary stray hairs into place in their sleek black coiffures, and settled camisa
or panuela with indescribably quick and bird-like movements. Those of them who could speak
Spanish talked clothes and babies and servants, or smiled politely at our mistakes in the language,
laughing out-right at their own futile efforts to speak English. They were astonished that
the quartermaster's wife should have attained the remarkable height of five feet eight inches
so young! Was it possible there were other women in America as tall? Taller even? 'Susmariajoseph!
But surely that was a joke? One never could tell when these Americans were joking.

One of the officers presented the Burnside women with some native hats typical of the island,
and the Filipinos were overcome with surprise at our interest in such ordinary headgear. What
were we going to do with the hats? Wear them ourselves? Oh, no, we hastened to explain, they
were to decorate our walls in America, that all our friends might see what pretty hats the
Filipino people wear. Decorate the wall with hats? What a very curious idea! They chatted volubly
over this idiosyncrasy, and even laughed at it, but quite decorously so that our feelings might
be spared. Suddenly one of them, a most vivacious girl, and evidently the belle of the village,
leaned over and in persuasive tones suggested that we women leave our hats, each real creations
of millinery art, for their walls, at which witticism they all giggled explosively and shrugged
their shoulders in rapturous appreciation of our confusion; all but the presidente's wife,
who looked shocked at such presumption and spoke to the younger women warningly in Visayan.

She was a shy and rather fat old lady--the presidente's wife--and seemed greatly impressed
by any statistics translated into Visayan for her information. Speaking Spanish but indifferently,
she made up for her linguistic deficiencies by a pair of eyes which let nothing escape them;
and she stared at us continually throughout the afternoon, seeming to be studying this new
species of woman as intently as a naturalist might some strange butterfly under a microscope.
Whenever we caught her eye she looked away hastily as if detected in an impropriety, and then
furtively resumed her inspection, taking in every detail of our wearing-apparel, from the real
hats upon our heads to the stout soled walking boots on our feet, the shine of our patent leathers
seeming to inspire her with more respect than any other part of our costume.

The only other shoes in the room, excepting those worn by the Americans and some few of the
native men, were the proud possession of a tiny girl eight years old. This fashionable young
person boasted also a European hat of coarse white straw stiffly trimmed with blue ribbon and
blue ostrich tips. That the feathers had a wofully limp, depressed, and bedraggled appearance;
that the ribbon was obviously cotton; and the straw of the coarsest weave, in no wise detracted
from the glorious knowledge that it was a hat, a real hat such as the Americanas themselves
were wearing. Sustained by this fact the young lady, who, in addition to the shoes and millinery,
wore only a single other garment, comported herself with great dignity. Even in the trying
circumstance of passing between one and the light, she was quite unconscious of anything amiss,
the proud assurance of being dressed in the height of style as to her head and feet, precluding
all worry as to minor details.

Among others met that afternoon at the Headquarters Building was a Spanish gentleman of charming
manners. He invited our party from the ship, and the officers stationed in town, to stop at
his house on our return to the launch and have some refreshments, an invitation we gladly accepted.
So the courtly Castilian, beaming with hospitable intent, hurried ahead to prepare for our
coming, we following shortly after in his footsteps. But to the young Spaniard's ill concealed
chagrin and our own embarrassment, the whole Filipino contingent accompanied us to the house.
Fully as many more natives gathered at every available door and window, while outside the band,
which had brought up a tuneful and triumphant rear, played the "Star Spangled Banner." After
all had partaken of Señor Montenegro's enforced liberality, we repaired to the launch, accompanied
by almost the entire population of Misamis, and amidst a shrill chorus of "Hasta la vista,"
and "Adios," we steamed back to the Burnside, whose twinkling lights shone out dimly against
the evening sky.

The next morning a party of Signal Corps men, accompanied by a guard of fifteen soldiers from
the fort, sailed at peep o' day in the ship's launches, the two in tandem towing a native banca
loaded with cable, which was to be laid in the Lintogup River and upper Panguil Bay, a stretch
of water too shallow for the Burnside herself to attempt its navigation. This cable was in
turn to be connected at Lintogup with Tukuran, on the southern coast of Mindanao, by a land
line across a mountainous country.

When the party started there were guns and ammunition enough on the two launches to have quelled
a good sized insurrection, but as little was really known of the upper bay and river, and as
many rumours were rife among the natives of Misamis as to warlike Moros and Monteses living
on these shores, and more disquieting rumours still among the officers that it was a camping
place for insurrectos, it was thought best to amply provide against any emergency.

Unfortunately, no information could be obtained as to the rise and fall of the tides or the
strength of the current, a fact that delayed the expedition many days and necessitated the
return of one or other of the launches for a renewal of rations, fresh water, and coal, not
once but thrice. The first, second, and third relief expeditions, we called them, and teased
the officer in charge unmercifully over his hard luck.

But at last, despite adverse winds and tides; despite the fact that one of the Filipino guides
ran the launch aground, with malice aforethought, no doubt, as on his return to Misamis he
was arrested on indubitable evidence as a spy; despite the fact that the sailing banca, ran
on the bar, and while trying to pull her off she and her five miles of cable were swamped;
despite the fact that the ship's launch Grace, or the Disgrace, as she was afterward called,
distinguished herself by blowing up twice and almost scalding everyone on board; despite the
fact that all the odds were against the expedition's success, and that it took six days and
nights to accomplish what might have been done in a third of the time--despite all this, I
say, the cable was at last laid and the luckless workers returned.

But, oh, the bitterness of life in general and that of a cable man in particular! For after
all those heroic struggles the first test showed a fault, and, cruel fate, at the far end of
Panguil Bay at that! The silence which greeted the reception of this terrible news was as profane
as words, and the Powers-that-Be decided on the spot that enough work had been spent on that
calamitous cable for the time being, and decided to proceed with the laying of the main lines,
leaving the Lintogup stretch until a subsequent visit to Misamis.

Meanwhile there was much work accomplished in the town, a fine telegraph office being established
on the principal street; and a trench completed by the shore end party; while much overhauling
of the cable in the tanks, and daily drills given to the Signal Corps soldiers in cable telegraphy
and the care of the instruments kept those aboard ship busy. Tic--tack, clic--clack, went the
little telegraph instrument at one end of the quarter-deck, and clic--clack, tic--tack answered
an instrument at the other end, hour after hour through the long, warm mornings, and the longer,
warmer afternoons.

On New Year's eve, several officers from the fort saw the century in with those of us remaining
on the Burnside, but the time passed so pleasantly that no one remembered the auspicious occasion
until the sound of sharp firing from the shore broke in upon our conversation. The jangling
of church bells followed, and one of the shore officers, usually a very cool and self-contained
young fellow, sprang to his feet, exclaiming as he buckled on his revolver, "Great heavens!
An attack on the town and I not there. May I have a ship's boat at once?" But even as he spoke
the Burnside's whistle blew a great blast, and several shots from the ship answered those on
shore, every man with a revolver, shotgun, or rifle adding his quota of noise to the general
hubbub.

And so it was the new century came to Mindanao, some thirteen hours ahead of its advent in
New York or Washington. Before eight bells had ceased striking a search-light greeting was
sent to our friends at Lintogup, but they, being tired after a hard day's work, slept supinely
on, unaware of our good wishes or the fact that a fine young century had been born to the old,
old world.

I am sorry to relate that the next day a court-martial was held in Misamis to try the irrepressible
guard who, in a burst of enthusiasm due to their first taste of twentieth century air, had
fired off their rifles. The soldiers were sentenced rather heavily, rifle-shots in a Philippine
town at that time being productive of dire results. Indeed, the shrill warning of the church
bells and scattered shots in a Mindanao village meant one thing only, an uprising in the town
or an attack from the outside, the incoming of a new century being of far less importance than
the preservation of order and quiet in the garrison, and no cognizance could be taken of a
new year which must be ushered in with a clang of firearms or the jangle of church bells--shrill
heralds of disaster.

On New Year's morning the presidente and secretario of Misamis, accompanied by their respective
families and a young Moro slave, the property of the secretario, came aboard the Burnside to
return our call. It was the first time any of them had ever seen a modern steamship, and loud
and voluble were their exclamations of wonder at what we have come to regard as the every-day
conveniences of civilization. After seeing the electric light, electric fans, and the shower
baths turned on and off several times, the presidente craved permission to essay these miracles
himself, and, to his own great surprise, accomplished supernatural results. The old wife watched
him tremblingly. Surely, these were works of the Evil One, and, as such, to be left to heretics.
But still the man persisted in his madness, and with a turn of his wrist brought light out
of darkness or water and wind from the very walls.

Finally he turned around, and with a humourous twinkle in his eye, that belied the gravity
of the rest of his face, he said: "The Americanos are a great people--a wonderful people--and
how unlike the Filipinos! When a Filipino wants sunshine or rain or wind, he must wait until
the good Lord gives it to him. When an Americano wants sunshine or rain or wind, he turns it on!"

The whole party was intensely interested in the big telescope which drew Misamis within a stone's
throw of the ship, and they could not in the least understand how we cooked in the steam galley
without any fuel, while the ice-machine and cold storage rooms were quite beyond their comprehension,
none of them ever having seen ice before. Of course, on seeing the strange substance, it must
be tasted as well, so iced drinks were served on the quarter-deck, these being received with
much preliminary trepidation and ultimate gustatory gratification. As for the small Moro slave,
I only hope he did not die from his excessive libations, for he drank unnumbered glasses of
lemonade, making most violent faces the while, and rubbing his small round stomach continually,
as if the unaccustomed cold had penetrated to his very vitals.

On going ashore, each of the three children carried back a box of American candy, the order
of our guests' departure being somewhat delayed by Señora Presidente's intense fear of going
down the gangway. As I have said before, she was a fat old lady, and the way was steep; but
finally, after much persuasion, she slipped her bare feet out of their velvet chinelas, gathered
her voluminous skirts close about her, and, seating herself upon the top step of the ladder,
slid down! Surely a simple solution of the difficulty.

That evening a ball was given in our honour at the Headquarters Building, which for the time
being was transformed into a most attractive place with palms and flags and coloured lanterns,
while just outside the broad windows a wonderful tropic sky, hung with silver stars, added
its enchantment to the scene. No carriage being available in the town, we walked from the dingy
little wharf to the Headquarters Building, arrayed in our very best, and followed by a guard
of armed soldiers, our escorts themselves wearing revolvers.

At every corner a dark form would shoot out suddenly from the shadows and there would be the
swift click of a rifle as it came to position, while a voice cried, "Halt! Who's there?" "A
friend," some one would reply, or "Officer of the garrison," as the case might be. Then again
would come the sentinel's voice telling the person challenged to advance and be recognized,
at which one of the number would march forward, and, on being identified, the rest of us were
allowed to pass the sentinel, who, meanwhile, kept his rifle at a port, his keen eye watching
closely, that no enemy slip by under our protection.

It was a rarely beautiful night even for the tropics, that first of January, and as we women
wore no wraps of any description, the contrast between our satins and chiffons and the rough
khaki clothes of the soldiers was a strange one; and still stranger was the fact of our going
under guard to a ball, a ball that at any moment might be interrupted by the bugles blowing
a call to arms, whereupon our partners would have to desert us, perhaps to quell an uprising
in the town, perhaps to defend it against an attack from the outside.

But fortunately the occasion was not marred by any such sinister happening, and doubtless still
lives in the annals of Misamis as a very grand affair, for everyone of consequence in town
was invited to the baille, and everyone invited came, not to mention those not invited who
came also. When we arrived the rooms were quite crowded and the dancing had begun. Far down
the street we heard the music and the sound of the women's heelless slippers shuffling over
the polished floor to a breathlessly fast waltz. If possible the people of Misamis dance faster
and hop higher than the people of Dumaguete, and how the women manage to keep on their chinelas
during these wild gyrations is quite beyond me.

As the secretario of the town played a harp in the orchestra--surely an evidence of versatility--we
ventured to ask if he would play a two-step very, very slowly, and hummed it in ordinary time.
At its beginning the Filipinos who had started to dance, stopped aghast. "Faster, faster!"
they cried in Spanish. "No one could dance to such slow music. This is a ball, men, not a funeral!"
But the secretario held the orchestra back, and in a few moments the Americans had the floor
to themselves, the Filipinos stopping partly because they found it impossible to dance to such
slow music and partly because they wanted to watch us.

They were all astonished at the apparent lack of motion in American dancing and the fact that
we got over the ground without hopping. Many of them asked officers stationed in the town if
the women wore a special kind of shoe to balls, as they appeared to be standing still and yet
moving at the same time, while one old man was heard explaining to his cronies that we wore
little wheels attached to the soles of our slippers--he had seen them--so that we did not have
to move at all, the men doing all the dancing and merely pushing us back and forth on the floor.
So much for the glide step as contrasted with the hop, though it must be confessed that the
natives were quite frank in liking their own dancing better than ours, one of the reasons being
that it gave them so much more exercise.

During the evening the natives gave a Visayan dance, called in the native tongue "A Courtship."
As the name implies, a young man and woman dance it vis-à-vis, the man courting the woman rhythmically
and to music, she at first resisting, flashing her dark eyes scornfully as she trips by him,
holding her fan to her face until he looks the other way, then peeping over its top at him,
only to turn her back in disdain when, emboldened by her interest, he approaches. Finally his
attentions become more pronounced, at which the girl grows coy, dropping her eyes shyly as
they dance past one another, and covering her face again and again from his too ardent gaze;
now bending her supple waist from side to side in time with the passionate music; now closing
her eyes languorously; now opening them wide and smiling at him tenderly over the top of her
fan, a graceful accomplice to her pretty coquetry. At last she surrenders to the wooing, the
happy pair dancing away together while the music plays faster and faster until at last it stops
with a great crash, that, we trust, not being symbolical of infelicity in wedlock. The dance
was very well done, and the native audience enjoyed it thoroughly, calling out chaffingly in
Visayan to the couple on the floor, and occasionally beating time to the music with hand or foot.

It was at this ball we met for the first time a family of American mestizas--three sisters
there were, if I remember rightly,--all pretty girls, with regular features and soft brown
hair, this hair distinguishing them at once from the other women of the place with their more
conventional blue-black tresses. It seems that the grandfather of these girls had been an American
sailor, who for some reason or other was marooned at Cagayan, Mindanao. Making the most, or
as a pessimist might think, the worst of a disadvantageous situation, he married a native girl
and raised a large and presumably interesting family, his descendants being scattered all over
the island. The Misamis branch were extremely aristocratic, and so proud of their blue blood
that since the arrival of the American troops they have associated with no one else in the
village. It is said that the girls even refer to the United States as "home," and occasionally
wear European clothes in preference to the far more becoming and picturesque costume of saya,
camisa, and panuela.

While in Misamis I verily believe that family was pointed out to us twenty times at least,
and whenever a man lowered his voice and started in with, "You see those girls over there?
Well, their grandfather was an American--" I steeled myself for what was to follow, and expressed
surprise and interest as politely as possible, for it is hard to attain conventional incredulity
over a twice-told tale. After the genealogy of the family had been gone over, root and branch,
we would invariably be told the story of how the grandfather, grown rich and prosperous in
his island home, once went to Manila on a business trip. He had then lived in Mindanao over
thirty years, during which time he had spoken nothing but Visayan, varied occasionally with
bad Spanish.

His negotiations at the capital taking him to an English firm, he started to address them in
his long unused mother tongue, when to his extreme mortification he found he could not speak
a word of English. Again and again he tried, the harsh gutturals choking in his throat, until
at last, flushed and angry, he was forced to transact his business in Spanish, all of which
amused the Britishers to the chaffing point. Leaving the office, the American flung himself
into the street, muttering savagely under his breath, a torrent of old memories surging through
his brain, those harsh English words in his throat clamouring for utterance. On and on he went,
until at a far corner he suddenly pulled himself up sharply, turned on his heel, and with all
speed walked back to the English firm, a shrewd smile playing about his hard old mouth. Throwing
open the door of the office, he walked abruptly in, saying as he did so, in an unmistakable
Yankee drawl, "Blankety blank blank it! I knew I could speak English. All I needed was a few
good cuss words to start me off!"

On the afternoon of January 3d, a party of Monteses visited the Burnside. Gaily turbaned and
skirted were these Moro men, their jackets fitting so tightly that some one suggested they
must have grown on them, that they were "quite natural and spontaneous, like the leaves of
trees or the plumage of birds." One's olfactory nerves also bore evidence that frequent ablutions
or change of garments were not customary among our guests, and the fact that when shown over
the ship they evinced but little interest in the bath spoke volumes.

Strange to say, what the Moros most admired were the brass railings around the walls of the
saloon, and the brass rods down the different stairways, in fact all the brass fittings on
the ship, a thing that puzzled us not a little until the interpreter explained that the Moros
thought the brass was solid gold, and were naturally much impressed thereat. Firearms they
also enthused over, and looked with envious eyes at the shotguns, rifles, and revolvers exhibited,
evincing great delight at the six and the one pounder guns on the quarter-deck. With the greatest
equanimity they accepted several little presents made them, nor deigned thanks of any sort
for benefits received, stuffing the different articles into their wide girdles with a stolid
indifference which was enlivened by a smile once only. This was at a case of needles given
to the leading Datto or chief, which, through the interpreter, we told him were for the wives
of his bosom; whereupon they all smiled broadly, the interpreter explaining it was because
we had sent the needles to women, as among Mindanao Moros men do all the sewing.

Being Mohammedans, they were very careful not to eat anything while on board ship for fear
of unconsciously transgressing the Holy Law, even refusing chocolate candy because it might
contain pork. They were shown ice, but took little interest in it, nor did they seem surprised
at the cold storage rooms or the electric lighting. It is possible they thought Americans had
attained the one really great thing in having white skins, after which all else followed as
a matter of course.

The next day we went to call on the presidente and his wife. They lived in a bare, forlorn
old house, with nothing attractive about it save the floor of the sala, which was of beautiful
hard wood polished with banana leaves until it would have served for a mirror. Everything was
scrupulously clean, but bespoke poverty, from the inadequate furniture of the sala to the patches
and darns on the old wife's stiffly starched skirt of abaca. This poverty was all the result
of the war, we were told, as much of their out of town property had been confiscated or ruthlessly
destroyed by the insurgents because of the presidente's unswerving loyalty to the American
government.

Both the presidente and his señora were delighted to see us, and while he discoursed on politics
and what the coming of the cable meant to the people of Mindanao, the good housewife bustled
about and brought forth the greatest delicacies her larder afforded, laying them out with proud
humility on the marble topped table of the sala. There were peaches and pears, canned in Japan,
and served right from the tin; there were little pink frosted cakes made in times prehistoric,
to judge from their mustiness, and carefully packed away in glass jars for just such great
occasions; there was good guava jelly and a Muscatelle that breathed of sunny vineyards in
Spain--indubitable evidence of better days.

The house was so bare and shabby that this gastronomic outlay seemed an unwarrantable expense,
yet what could one do but accept their hospitality in the same generous spirit in which it
was offered? So at ten o'clock of a steaming hot morning we cheerfully stuffed ourselves on
badly preserved fruits, elderly small cakes with enamelled complexions, and tiny sips of liquid
fragrance, our reward of merit being the little señora's beaming face.

Indeed, she even stopped apologizing after a bit, and while the presidente was toasting everybody
from the "Chief Magistrate of America" down to our very humble selves, she sent a muchacho
out to borrow the hand-organ belonging to a neighbour, this musical instrument being highly
venerated in Misamis. On its arrival the presidente himself turned the crank, and with such
vigour that I feared a stroke of apoplexy on his part.

A little later, as we were leaving, the señora took us into what would have been the stable
had they possessed horses, a large open space under the house, to the right of which a room
had been partitioned off with bamboo. Inside this partition a Filipina servant worked the señora's
loom. Back and forth went the shuttle under the little maid's deft fingers, and up and down
went her slender bare foot on the treadle, so that even as we watched the striped red and cream
abaca grew under our very eyes.

Unfortunately I became enthusiastic, and nothing would do but that the old lady must present
me with several yards of the pretty stuff. I felt as if I should be tried for larceny, what
with those indigestible fruits, the pink cheeked cakes, the Muscatelle, and finally the abaca.
I protested vigorously, I even pleaded, but in vain.

"You are my daughter," laughed the señora, happily, "my white daughter. The abaca is yours--coarse
stuff that it is," and she reached up timidly and kissed me, first on one cheek and then on
the other, the joy of giving in her dear old eyes.

The next day dawned so clear and beautiful that three of us decided, there being little work
on hand until the Lintogup party's return, to take a long drive around Misamis, and if we had
time to even go so far as its four outposts. On the previous day the presidente had unearthed
a queer little carriage out of a junk heap, and put this conveyance and a wise looking piebald
pony at our disposal. The carriage was an odd affair between a calesa and carromata in shape,
or like a high surrey with a small seat for the driver in front. It was beautifully clean,
with a new bit of carpet at our feet, and cushioned in sky-blue tapestry. As there was but
a single seat at the back, in addition to the driver's seat in front, one of the two men of
our party offered to relieve the Filipino in charge of the trap, and do the driving himself,
but the native shook his head, declaring we would find the pony unmanageable. We thought not,
but the driver was firm, and although the back seat was not very wide, we piled in upon the
sky-blue cushions, trying to look as pleasant as possible in the circumstances.

After some persuasion on the part of the Filipino, the piebald pony started and proved to be
a fine little animal with an unusually clean and even gait. The air was fresh and invigorating,
and as we passed other Burnside friends trudging through the sand of the beach or toiling laboriously
along the dusty road of the town, we congratulated ourselves on securing the only available
trap in the place, and marvelled at the way our pony covered ground.

"Why, any one could drive him," remarked one of the trio. "He's a fine little beast." "To be
sure," assented the others. But just then a treacherous feminine hat blew off, and we had to
stop and pick it up. That was but the work of an instant--the stopping--but when it came to
starting again--well, you just ought to have seen how that piebald acted! He simply laughed
at the idea, his laugh extending in ecstatic chuckles all the way down his spinal column till
the very carriage shook with his mirth. Then he planted his two fore feet down hard as much
as to say, "I challenge you to budge me one inch from this spot," and though the Filipino threatened,
entreated, implored, and finally beat him unmercifully with the handle of the whip, the piebald
stood his ground.

At last the two men clambered out of the high vehicle, and after tugging for some minutes at
the rope bridle, succeeded in starting the stubborn animal along, but at so furious a gait
that they had all they could do to get up over the wheels and into their seat again. All went
well for about a quarter of a mile, when to our surprise the driver started to turn around.
"Here, hombre," called one of the men, in what he was pleased to consider Spanish, "we don't
want to go home yet. We want to go to the outposts--way out, sabe?" Yes, he "sabed," grinning
broadly the while, but this, señor, was the outpost.

We were dumbfounded, and stared stupidly at the white tent among the trees. "Why don't they
call 'em inposts?" growled one of the men, and then to the driver, "Very well, hombre, take
us to the other three. We want to see 'em all." But this was easier said than done. Again our
wise-looking piebald balked, and balked most awfully. Again the two men, at imminent danger
to life and limb, jerked at the rope bridle, and again barely escaped with their lives as they
performed the perilous acrobatic feat of falling headlong into the carriage while it was going
at full speed.

After the sixth performance of this kind, one being at a street crossing where some raw cocoa
beans were drying on a petate in the sun, and the three others at the different outposts, we
decided among ourselves that we had best dismiss our cochero and return to the ship, since
it had taken us more than two hours to drive where we might have walked in thirty minutes.

It was here a most embarrassing situation arose, for just as we were debating what to pay our
Jehu, something in my boot heels suggested that perhaps the native was not a coachman at all,
but a Filipino gentleman taking us to drive at the request of the presidente. There was the
sign manual of Misamis's four hundred about him. He wore shoes. Moreover, he sported a very
large and very yellow twenty dollar gold piece on his watch-chain. But stronger even than these
evidences of native gentility was the freedom from restraint in the very frequent remarks he
had tentatively thrown over his shoulder during the drive, and the fact that he had not weakened
when, on first coming ashore, we had tried to browbeat him out of driving the horse.

"But if he is a cochero, and we don't pay him, he'll think we're cheating him," wailed one of us.

"And if he isn't a cochero, and we do pay him, he'll be indignant," affirmed another.

My boot heels gave me another suggestion. Being a woman, I suppose I have intuitions, but I
trust my boot heels every time. They are more reliable. "How would it do," I suggested, with
a consciousness of superiority which I trust did not sound in my voice, "How would it do to
stop a sentinel and ask whether our friend is a coachman or the mayor of the town?" and even
as I spoke a sentinel hove in sight and was promptly interrogated by the men.

"Him?" returned the soldier in answer to our questions, "Him? Why, he's the richest man in
these parts, I reckon, and holds some big job under the government. I forget what just now,
but provost marshal, chief of police, or somethin' like that." We gasped at our narrow escape,
and after getting that villainous automobile horse in motion again, pressed some cigars upon
our distinguished host, and on reaching the dock thanked him heartily for our charming morning,
impressing upon him that the Burnside was at his disposition at any and all times, an invitation
of which he later availed himself.

On the afternoon of January 9th the fault which we had been seeking so long in the cable tank
was located, and two and a half miles of cable were taken out before the fault could be removed.
We then weighed anchor and buoyed six miles out, talked with Misamis over the wire, and then
attached the end to a buoy and dropped it overboard, preferring to wait until morning to make
our splice and proceed on our return trip to Dumaguete. At daylight we picked up the buoy,
drew the end of the cable on board, spliced it, and at eight o'clock were proceeding toward
the island of Negros, laying cable as we went.

Then for the first time did we hoist the cable-ship insignia on the foremast head, three balls,
which at a little distance looked not unlike the sign of a pawnshop, though our three balls
were hung vertically from the masthead, two red ones with a white octahedron shape between
them. After dark two red lights with a white centre light were substituted for these signals,
each serving as a warning to other vessels that we were either laying or picking up cable and
could not be expected to observe the etiquette of the high seas. In other words, we were to
have the right of way. As I understand it, disabled steamers also carry three balls by day,
all of them being red in that case, and by night three red lights, our centre white ball by
day and centre white light after dark protecting us from well-meant efforts at rescue by other
vessels, which would of course foul our cable and cause no end of mischief.

We sailed very slowly to Dumaguete, not over five knots an hour, with the cable paying out
perhaps six knots, this speed limitation being necessary in order to stop the ship quickly
in case of accident. It seemed a sentient thing, that cable creeping slowly along the paying
out machinery, winding itself over the drum, and then stretching out to full length and disappearing
down the covered wooden cable troughs on the main and quarter decks, and so into the sea at
the stern of the ship; the hose meanwhile playing a stream of water over the drum, brakes,
and jockey pulley, where the friction is always greatest. This water ran off in a dirty yellow
stream, flooding the forward deck, while the tar from the cable decorated the ship from stem
to stern, thus transforming our Burnside from a pretty, trig looking yacht into a veritable
work-a-day old scow.

Everyone on board was in the best possible spirits all morning because we were really under
way and accomplishing work that showed. Even the natives in the tank, swiftly passing the cable
from hand to hand, were singing in barbaric monotone to themselves, while we idle ones on the
quarter-deck read a marvellous tale of love and bloodshed to the monotonous accompaniment of
the cable shuffling through the wooden troughs beside us.

At about four in the afternoon, however, just as we were lazily deciding to ring for tea, there
came a rush of feet from the forward part of the ship and a jangle of the engine-room's bell
meaning "Full speed astern!" But quick as the ship was in coming to a standstill, and quick
as were the Signal Corps men in stopping the machinery, the cable itself was quicker, and in
less time than it takes to tell it, a tangle of cable in the tanks blocked the drum, causing
so tremendous a strain that the cable broke, the end going overboard.

We were all sick at heart, none more so than the poor Filipino who had been knocked flat by
the cable on its erratic departure from the tank. Fortunately, the native was more frightened
than hurt, and not many moments later joined in a game of monte with his friends not on duty
at the time. The cable laying machinery was then transformed into a grappling machine, and
by half past seven that evening the strain on the dynamometer showed we had in all probability
hooked something. An hour later the end was on board, and by midnight a satisfactory splice
had been made by a sergeant of the Signal Corps, in charge of such work, and his band of native
cable splicers. Then sufficient tests were made to ascertain if the joint were perfect, that
is, if the insulation of the new piece of cable, when added to that already laid, gave the
right answer.

Meanwhile some one ascertained our position with a sextant, these observations being marked
on the cable map and entered in the log to facilitate the work of locating and repairing the
splice in case of accident at that particular point, though it must be confessed that these
splices often proved more sound than the original cable. After this data had been duly registered,
the bight was lowered over the side of the ship and we were again under way, "dragging our
tail behind us" like the poetical sheep of the nursery rhyme.

Everything worked perfectly after this, and we arrived off the Dumaguete buoy the following
afternoon. On sighting it, a boat was lowered, in which our "able cable seaman," as we called
him, with his crew of native "buoy jumpers," set forth to fasten the cable attached there to
a stout rope from the ship. Then the buoy was cut away and taken into the little boat, the
cable being heaved aboard by means of the drum, where, after detaching the mushroom anchor,
tests were made and final telegraphic instructions sent to Misamis about connecting the office
there. Then the final splice was made, and the two women of the Burnside were given the privilege
of cutting the slip-ropes that held the cable on the ship. It had already been lowered over
the bows, and only these ropes held it in place.

"If anything goes wrong now, you are to blame," said the Powers-that-Be severely, and I, personally,
felt the responsibility of so momentous an event, and awaited with no little nervousness the
signal which would tell us to sever the ropes, for it was important that the two fastenings
should be cut at exactly the same moment to avoid a strain on the cable. "Now!" called the
cable expert. It was a thrilling moment. My little kris dagger seemed scarcely to make an impression
on the stout Manila rope. "Faster! Harder!" called some one, and we sawed with all our strength.
A moment more and the green waters of the bay had opened and closed over the cable--the first
stretch of it laid on the trip--and we women had helped do it.

Everyone on board was excited over the great event, the very natives, tired as they were, sending
up a faint viva, and at dinner that evening it was easy to see a strain had been lifted from
all the officers. Not a man but was freshly shaved and attired in immaculate white linen in
contradistinction to the inevitable khaki. Later, however, the young officer who had been sent
ashore to make the final adjustments in the Dumaguete office, came aboard with the disheartening
information that Misamis could not be raised, and the ensuing depression on the Burnside was
appalling.

The next morning a wire was run ashore connecting the cable hut with the ship, and by what
is called a capacity test, the trouble was located at Misamis. So late that night, instead
of going to Iligan, as we had expected, we sailed for Misamis again, arriving there a little
after one on the following day. The fault was found in a lightning arrester which one of the
operators had neglected in the cable hut. This was remedied, and the cable connection between
Misamis and Dumaguete completed.

Immediately the natives poured into the cable office with numberless messages for friends or
business acquaintances, and knots of men gathered about the building and congratulated each
other on the great event. At last the much talked-of communication with the outer world was
at hand, a marvel no less astounding to the minds of these people than would be the realization
of those stories of Harun-al-Rashid's days to our more complex civilization, those dear, delightful
days of genie and fairy, when two and two didn't always make four, and when nothing was too
impossible to happen.

That afternoon a schooner was hired, and five miles of cable for the Misamis shore end of Iligan's
line of communication was put aboard her. At daybreak on Monday, January 14th, the schooner
started out to lay the cable, while a second party dug the trench and prepared for the landing
of the shore end. This was all completed by ten o'clock, and we were under way for Iligan,
towing the schooner at our stern. We sailed very slowly, as bearings and soundings were being
taken all day, anchoring off our destination late that afternoon.

Chapter IV

ILIGAN

Our first glimpse of Iligan was not assuring, as only the Headquarters Building could be seen
from the harbour, and in front of it, reaching to the left for some distance, stood a long,
single row of cocoanut-palms, so tall that the green foliage was far above the top of the house,
making the trees look like stiff bouquets in absurdly long wooden holders. At the foot of these
trees water, blue as indigo on wash day, lashed itself into a white fury against the stonework
of the pier.

Before daybreak on the following morning the Signal Corps had its breakfast, and aside from
the not always obvious compensation which undeviating good conduct is said to bring, we had
a very evident reward for our early rising in seeing Jupiter and Venus in a brilliant stellar
flirtation, the Southern Cross as chaperone giving sanction to the affair.

Before the night had really paled into a gray dawn, three life-boats from the ship, each loaded
with some six hundred feet of cable, were fastened in tandem and drawn to the shore by a stout
rope, which had already been run to the beach, and the two shore ends, one for Misamis and
one for Cagayan, Mindanao, were laid with but little trouble. As Iligan's insurrectionary population
was too aristocratic to demean itself by manual labour for any monetary consideration, the
soldiers of the infantry company stationed at Iligan were detailed to dig the trench. But,
being Americans, they worked with a right good will, completing the trench late that afternoon.
The office was also established by this time, after which the two shore ends were laid and
buoyed, thus accomplishing a tremendous day's work.

In the early afternoon we women went ashore sight-seeing, and found Iligan chiefly interesting
for what it was not. On paper--Spanish paper, that is--the town is represented as a city of
some magnitude, boasting handsome barracks for the soldiers, two beautiful churches, many well-built
houses and shops, a railway running from the outskirts of the town to Lake Lanao, a handsome
station for Iligan's terminal of the line, and many other modern improvements, including fine
waterworks.

In reality, Iligan is a little nipa-shack settlement, some of the nipa buildings being very
pretty, to be sure, but hardly pretentious enough for city dwellings. As for the railway to
Lake Lanao, all that is left of it are two old engines and some dilapidated cars in a discouraged,
broken down shed on the outskirts of the village, the shed doubtless representing the handsome
station aforementioned. Even the rails of the road have been carried away by the Moros to be
made into bolos and krises.

As for the barracks, the natives say that the Spaniards burnt them down on evacuating in favour
of their American foe, while the churches probably never existed save in imagination, though
one place of worship was in process of construction at the time of our visit, the skeleton
of its framework being covered by a well finished roof, which, by the way, is a peculiarity
of carpentering in these islands. The woodwork of the structure had a weather-beaten air, which
told only too plainly how long a time had elapsed since its foundation-stone was laid, and
on all sides the houses were deserted and dropping into decay. Board fences rotted under a
pitiless sun, and gardens, overgrown with weeds and rank vegetation, encroached on the highway,
which seemed to hold the glare of noon in its stifling dust. Degraded, wretched looking pigs
wallowed about under one's very feet, and thin babies scowled at us fiercely from behind the
skirts of their unsmiling mothers.

With the exception of two or three very good little shops, run of course by the ubiquitous
Chinaman, at which one could purchase Moro turbans, sarongs--the long skirt-like garments in
which Moro men and women wrap themselves--petates, or sleeping mats of split bamboo, and other
like curios, Iligan is a most unattractive and desolate place, by God forsaken and by man forgot.

Picturesque it could not help being. All Philippine coast towns accomplish that, built as they
are of caña and nipa in the midst of luxuriant foliage, and surrounded by palms and bamboos,
beyond which spread verdant plains or lofty forest hills on one side, and on the other stretches
of sunlit sea and an unobstructed view of the blue and cloudless sky. Lovely beyond description,
to be sure, but a loveliness of which one would tire all too quickly, its very beauty becoming
monotonous, like the pretty face of an insipid woman; its sunshine and balmy airs but an aggravation
to the soul, combining to make one long for rugged outlines, rough east winds, and climatic
hardships and privations, anything rather than the enervation of that unending tropic softness.

Market-day, which comes every Saturday at Iligan, made a break in the dull uniformity of our
several visits there. It was full of interest to everyone, for it is then the Moros come to
town, like the beggars in the old nursery rhyme, "some in rags and some in tags," but none
in velvet gowns, no doubt because of climatic exigencies. It was a glorious day of dazzling
sunshine, and the market-place fairly swarmed in colour, which blinded the eyes and warmed
the heart. There were to be seen in sarong, or coat, or turban the faded reds and subdued blues
that artists love, with here and there a dash of vivid green, scarlet, and purple, barbarously
tropical.

The Moros were represented mostly by men and boys, lithe, graceful creatures, their legs encased
in skin-tight trousers, or else concealed entirely by a sarong wrapped closely about them,
the long end tucked into a belt at the front. Their jackets, in the gayest of colours, fitted
them not wisely for so hot a climate, but too well; their long, lank hair, done up in a knot
at the back of the head, was usually surmounted by a resplendent turban, whose colours shrieked
and stuck out their tongues at each other, being on even worse terms with the rest of the costume;
and in their belts would be stuck a barong or kris, often both, and a square or semicircular
box of brass, sometimes inlaid with copper, sometimes handsomely carved, and sometimes plain.
These boxes were divided into three compartments on the inside, one for betel-nut, one for
the lime to be smeared on the betel, and one for the leaves of the pepper-tree, in which the
combination of lime and betel is wrapped before being chewed. Dattos of rank were followed
by a slave carrying these boxes, the receptacle in their case being large and much more beautiful
in design.

It was hard to differentiate the few women in the crowd from the men, for they also wore a
sarong wrapped closely about them, which, if it slipped aside for a moment, showed a tight
fitting jacket of gay cotton worn over a camisa, short at the waist line, where a band of brown
flesh showed frankly between it and the top of the wide, bloomer-like garment on the nether
limbs. They also wore their hair in a knot at the back of the head, with a long, straight wisp
hanging out of the coil, and in most instances were much less attractive than the men, being
quite as unprepossessing in appearance, and lacking the redeeming strength and symmetry which
gave beauty to the masculine figure.

Several of the Moro men, presumably chiefs by the goodly number of slaves following in their
train, protected their august heads by means of a gaily coloured parasol; others had the parasol
held over them by one of their retainers, while at their sides gambolled small Moro boys, either
entirely naked or decorously clothed in a very abbreviated shirt. Some of the youngsters sported
old sarongs, which could be discarded or put on at their discretion, and only one boy seen
throughout the morning was fully clothed.

A delightful figure was that of a Moro dressed in a faded sarong drawn closely about him from
waist to knee. Above this he sported a flannel blouse on which he had fastened with safety-pins
two very dilapidated infantry shoulder-straps of a second lieutenant's grade. He also wore
on his right breast some crossed cannon of American artillery and a huge Spanish medal. On
his head was a plaid turban, as parti-coloured as the proverbial coat of the over-dressed Joseph.
Between the straining buttons of his blue flannel blouse dark flesh gushed forth, and from
beneath the variegated headgear fell some straight, straggling locks, too short to be confined
neatly in the coil of hair at the back of his head. He was not at all averse to having his
charms of person and dress perpetuated in a photograph, and from the way the Moros and natives
gathered around him it was evident that he was a personage of no little importance in the community.

Scattered around the market-place were various groups of Iligan natives and Moros from the
hills, all squatting on the ground, and haggling over the price of fish and eggs. There were
Moro chiefs, looking world-wearied and indifferent, followed by their attendant slaves; there
were thrifty Moros willing to sell one anything from a kris or a barong to the very clothes
on their backs; there were handsome young Moro blades, who stared shyly at the strange white
faces and chatted volubly the while in their soft Malay tongue; there were Philippine market
women in camisa and panuela, some of them carrying large, flat baskets of vegetables or fruits
on their heads, the green of ripe oranges and bananas making an effective splash of colour
above their dusky hair; there were a few, a very few, Moro women, as I have said before, and
they wrapped themselves more closely in their sarongs as we approached, smiling at us broadly
with the utmost friendliness, their blackened teeth behind red, betel-stained lips reminding
one irresistibly of watermelon seeds in the fruit.

Of course the Moros asked us exorbitant prices for their arms, Americans being made of money,
and transient Americans, in particular, having the added reputation of being utterly bereft
of reasoning faculties, but we had been warned as to their business methods by officers of
the post, so were as adamant. At first the Moros seemed indifferent whether we purchased or
not, and only when we had really embarked in one of the life-boats for the ship did they let
us have the knives for one-half of what they had originally demanded.

One gentleman who boasted a coat, sarong, and wide sash of brilliant green, the material being
of Moro manufacture, and hence of great interest to the Burnside people, was possessed that
one of us should buy the outfit, and only with great difficulty and the utmost tact was he
persuaded from denuding himself then and there, so anxious was he to make a sale; and long
after the life-boat was under way did some belated Moro rush to the beach, wildly gesticulating
and calling, evidently willing to exchange some treasured knife, buyo box, or brightly coloured
turban for American gold at our own valuation, although he had perhaps scorned a very high
price for these same things earlier in the day.

The second morning after our arrival at Iligan, on the occasion of our first visit there, all
on board were shocked to hear that one of the buoys attached to a cable anchored in the bay
was missing. It was the buoy to which the Cagayan shore end had been fastened, and there was
not a little mystery as to how it could have got away from its mushroom anchor. So, instead
of starting to lay the cable to Misamis, we used the machinery as a fishing tackle, and, after
some little trouble, hooked the Cagayan cable in a hundred and twenty-five fathoms of water.
Later in the day the buoy was picked up, a most disreputable looking object, banged and battered
almost beyond recognition, which showed it had undoubtedly been struck during the night by
the ship's propeller, owing to the tremendously swift current in the harbour.

All that afternoon the cable sang its song of the drum, in preparation for the morrow's trip,
and a little after daylight the next morning the Misamis buoy was picked up and its cable spliced
to that in the main tank, after which we left Iligan, paying out the cable so slowly that it
was five o'clock before we anchored off the Misamis buoy, just in time for a splice to be made
ere the swift darkness of the tropics was upon us.

The signal sergeant in charge of such work had a large audience that evening watching his skilful
joining together of the two ends of cable. How deft he was in unwinding the sheathing wire,
how exact in cutting off just the right amount of core from each end of the cable, how careful
in stripping the insulation from the cores' end with a sharp knife not to nick the wires, which
would have produced untold trouble. Then the seven wires stranded together in each end were
unwound, carefully cleaned and scraped, that they might solder readily, after which they were
again twisted together with pliers, and the joint completed. When this was done the rubber
tape was wound round and round the copper wires, after which the whole was put into a vulcanizing
bath of hot paraffine. Upon soaking half an hour, it was removed from the paraffine and the
jute serving was bound back again; then the armour--a steel wire spiral jacket--was replaced,
the spirals winding back into their original position with the greatest ease. Wire was then
wound at intervals over this steel jacket to keep the spirals in place, after which the whole,
for ten or fifteen feet in length, was served with a neat finish of spun yarn.

At sunrise the next morning we went into the harbour of Misamis for the third time, staying
just long enough to ascertain that the cable was working satisfactorily, after which we sailed
once again for Iligan, leaving there the following day for Cagayan, taking soundings every
half hour in preparation for the laying of the cable between those two places. The morning
was so rainy and disagreeable that no bearings could be had, but just as we were nearing the
harbour of Cagayan, at about four in the afternoon, the mist cleared away, the sun came out
wetly from behind a mass of clouds, and over the harbour to the southeast stretched a bow of
promise, with the town of Cagayan standing at one end of the arc like the proverbial pot of
gold for which we hunted in childhood.

Chapter V

CAGAYAN

After Dumaguete, Misamis, and Iligan, the harbour of Cagayan presented a truly metropolitan
appearance, what with a transport, a coasting vessel, and a navy gunboat, all in at the same
time. From the Burnside we could see nothing of the town save a very dingy wharf, a few white
tents pitched near the water's edge for the convenience of soldiers guarding the unloading
of vessels, and a settlement of nipa shacks, in front of which were gaily coloured washings
hung out to dry in the hot sun. For miles in every direction hills, with but little vegetation
on their volcanic sides, rose tier above tier as far as the eye could reach, and the bay reflected
on its placid surface every cloud in the heavens, every tree on the shore.

The long two and a half mile drive from the wharf of Cagayan to the town proper is lined on
either side with well-built nipa dwellings, a schoolhouse, and some native shops, at that time
all empty. The windows stared back at one like wide-open sightless eyes; the doors swung to
and fro in the warm breeze, and occasionally gave a passing glimpse of a shrine to the Virgin
or some saint, the faded flowers still in the vases, the candles burned out, and the placid
face looking straight into one's own, pathetic in its neglect.

Deserted Village was writ large on this entrance to Cagayan, but the town itself looked prosperous;
the little shops were flourishing; and the natives, with ill-concealed interest, peered out
furtively from under their jalousie blinds as the great swinging Dougherty wagon, with its
four strapping mules, tore down the broad streets, taking us to or from the ship.

This Dougherty wagon was at our disposal all the time we were there, thanks to the courtesy
of the colonel commanding, though sometimes, when there was an unusually large party from the
ship, we women were put into a two-seated barouche of great antiquity, as dingy and faded as
its own cerulean lining, but the only carriage in town. The officers called this delightful
equipage "the extreme unction," as it was owned by the padres before the government bought
it, and was by them used in last visits to the dying. The natives crossed themselves on passing
this conveyance, and would no more have ridden in it than in a hearse, but we found "the extreme
unction" very comfortable and heard no groans or death-bed confessions in its rusty creak,
neither saw aught in its moth-eaten tapestry but that it had once been very handsome. To our
frivolous minds the old carriage resembled nothing so much as Cinderella's coach just as the
clock was striking twelve, and we were constantly expecting it to turn into a pumpkin under
our very eyes. But it refrained from doing anything so unconventional, and took us on many
pleasant excursions around the quaint old town.

There was much to be seen in Cagayan, as for instance, the Door of the Bloody Hand, a most
gruesome memento of a night attack on the place some time before, when several insurgents,
fleeing from avenging Americans, tried to force their way into one of the native houses and
seek protection from its inhabitants. Then there was the Amazon colonel of a native regiment,
who, on the day we saw her, was spreading out washing to dry on a grass plot near her home,
a truly feminine occupation, considering her martial proclivities, and one that disappointed
us sadly, as we should have preferred seeing her at dress parade; and lastly, there was the
old cathedral, which in its way was decidedly unique.

This cathedral was far more pretentious than any we had seen outside of Manila, and its altars,
for it boasted several, were unspeakable combinations of cheap gaudiness and some little beauty.
Common tinsel was cheek by jowl with handsome silver, and while a few of the many mural decorations
and paintings were good, most of them were atrocious--glorified chromos of simpering saints
with preternaturally large eyes, more nearly resembling advertisements for a hair dye or complexion
bleach than ecclesiastical subjects. Around the main altar stood armoured soldiers of Biblical
antiquity, squat, inelegant figures that had first been painted on canvas and were afterward
cut out like gigantic paper dolls, being put into wooden grooves to ensure their perpendicularity.

At one side of the church was a glass case containing a coffin of regulation size, the wax
figure within being covered with a black shroud so that a bare arm only was visible. Across
the soft white flesh, for it was a woman's arm, ran a hideously realistic burn, suggesting
that the figure might have been that of some Christian martyr, the probable patron saint of
Cagayan. Before the principal altar stood quaint prayer stools of ebony carved to resemble
kneeling human figures, and in the loft was a very good organ, though somewhat high-pitched
and reedy in tone.

The native women of Cagayan were rather more progressive than those in the towns we had just
visited. Some of them even wore hats, and straightway copied, or rather, tried to copy, those
worn by the cable-ship contingent. They also rode bicycles, looking most incongruous awheel,
the long, spade shaped train to their skirts tucked out of the way, their wide camisa sleeves
standing out like stiff sails on either side, their demure and modest little kerchiefs swelling
with the quick throbbing of their adventurous hearts. We were told that one of these women,
after seeing the quartermaster's wife riding a bicycle in her very short and modish skirt,
straightway took two deep tucks in her own long saya, train and all. Verily, the spirit of
that Filipina in an American would have emboldened her to wear--bloomers? Perish the thought--knickerbockers!

At the time of our first visit to Cagayan, the principal occupation of the American troops
there seemed to be chasing two bands of insurrectos under the respective leadership of one
Capistrano and one Vajez, most wily game, that led them many a weary tramp over the mountainous
hills surrounding the town. Shortly after our arrival Vajez was captured, and a milder-mannered
man never laid traps of spears and forked bamboo in the pathway of an enemy. He was the personification
of gentleness and confided to the American officer in command that he would long since have
taken the oath of allegiance had not circumstances, over which he had no control, prevented.
The general, greatly impressed by the cogency of these remarks from a man brought in by force,
sent him to Manila by the first available transport, that he might spread the light to his
brethren there, after which he was doubtless given opportunity for more proselyting work in Guam.

Capistrano was made of sterner stuff, and on our numerous visits to Cagayan still roamed the
mountains with his picturesque robber band. One day, under a flag of truce, he came to town
and discussed the military situation with the authorities. He made one very astonishing claim,
namely, that he had no animosity against the Americans, and was not seeking a fight, meaning,
doubtless, he would rather run than fight, any day, but that he felt remaining in permanent
armed protest, passive though it was, sufficed to show the world his attitude toward our military
occupation of the Philippines. The spectacle of a large number of well armed men who would
not fight in any circumstances has the merit of novelty. It sounds like a Gilbert and Sullivan
opera. But Capistrano evidently had no sense of humour, and until surrendering, he and his
followers kept well out of the way of the American army, lest they be disturbed in pursuing
the gentle art of peace.

Socially, we enjoyed Cagayan to the utmost, and if fault could be found with our numerous visits
there, it was that we had too good a time, so good that the undoubted local interest of the
place quite faded into insignificance beside its purely social side. There were luncheons and
dinners given us on shore; and dinners and luncheons given by us on the ship; there was a delightful
tea on the gunboat, and a concert by the infantry band in our honour; there were horseback
rides for those who cared for them, though all went well armed, as the roads around Cagayan
were then in hostile territory; while the shooting for the men was exceptionally good, though
this was not discovered until our last visit to Cagayan, when the quartermaster, after a half
day's outing, returned with a prodigious string of ducks.

But while we aristocrats of the Burnside idled away the sunlit hours, the workers had landed
the cable, put up an office in the town, and run a line on iron poles from the wharf to the
cable station; the testing department, meanwhile, turning over cable on the ship, faults having
developed which were not located for several days. But on the morning of January 3d all was
considered ready for the return trip to Iligan.

Before leaving, two buoys were swung overboard with a block and tackle arrangement, one five
miles north and the other ten or fifteen miles in the same direction, small lamps being placed
on each, thus converting them into temporary lighthouses should we return to Cagayan after
dark, or in the event of our return by daylight, the buoys themselves, looming up big and red,
would serve as guides, observations having been made with the sextant upon them and adjacent land.

By half past one that afternoon we weighed anchor and sailed out of the harbour, our friends
on the different ships waving us good-bye, and that night lay off Iligan in a very rough sea.
At daybreak we drew alongside the buoy, got it and the shore end aboard, and before splicing,
"spoke" Iligan, making several tests which showed that end working satisfactorily. Then the
splice was completed, and by evening we were under way for Cagayan, laying cable as we went.

In less than an hour after we started there was great excitement on board, even the loungers
on the quarter-deck hurrying forward to hear the details of what might have been a very serious
accident, due to the cable slipping on the drum. Had the officer on watch not been very prompt
and efficient the cable would have become unmanageable, "taken charge," as it is called, resulting
in great inconvenience, delay, and possible loss of life to those in the tank.

As it was, we had a delightfully uneventful sail, anchoring off Cagayan that evening a little
after six o'clock. Not caring to make so important a splice after dark, the cable was cut and
buoyed overnight. This was necessary, as that particular splice had to be made from a small
boat, which of course precluded the use of electric lights. But by nine o'clock on the following
morning our splice was completed, and communication established between Misamis, Iligan, and
Cagayan, the line being most satisfactory in every respect. So it was with light hearts that
we sailed for Cebu, on the island of Cebu, where we were to coal, picking up our giant buoys
as we went.

Chapter VI

CEBU

Early the next morning we sailed into Cebu harbour, and found it alive with ships of all sorts
and conditions. From the sea there is nothing picturesque about the town. It is a grimy, dirty
place that might be located anywhere in the world, with huge warehouses and rows of squat,
ugly buildings near the shore, and in the distance, over the gray walls of the inevitable fort,
church spires and green tree tops intermingle under a burning sky.

Before we were really at anchor small boats filled with boys and girls clustered around our
ship, the children yelling in English--English, mark you!--for coins to be thrown overboard
that they might plunge into the swift current after them. There was a veritable pandemonium
of noise, for while some of the occupants of the bancas dove for the pennies, amid wild shrieks
of laughter, others, most of them quite young boys, went through the manual of arms very acceptably,
with little sticks in lieu of rifles; still others danced and acted a Spanish fandango; while
the more mature among our entertainers sang a song so swinging in measure that it appealed
to me instantly as one that would be immensely taking were it sung in an American music-hall.
It had an indescribable roof garden cadence, and I found myself humming it delightedly. At
the end of the second verse I was so carried away by its possibilities that, turning to a group
of people talking near the rail, I remarked that with rag-time words, it would be vastly popular
in American vaudeville. At which everyone stared incredulously for a moment, until one of the
number, realizing the situation, managed to explain, between gasps of laughter, that "Hello,
my Baby, Hello, my Honey" was in its dotage in the United States. Then the laughter became
general, for all were more recent arrivals from America than I, and it was hard for them to
understand how so elderly and decrepit a ditty could be unfamiliar to any one.

When the classic words of "Hello, my Baby, Hello, my Honey," were repeated for my benefit,
and I realized that not only had these Cebu natives picked up the air of the song, but the
component parts of its speech as well, my disgust was complete, for it showed that Cebu, dirty
and disagreeable as it was, also lacked local colour, liberal applications of which we had
found so necessary in the Philippines.

Despite our several visits to Cebu, few of us found cause to change our first opinion as to
its unpleasantness. Indeed, it would be hard to imagine a more uninteresting, bedraggled, down-at-the-heel
place than this. Aside from the old churches and conventos, a few pretty drives, and a wonderful
view from the top of the fort, we found nothing to like about it, for the natives were sullen
and unfriendly, while the town itself was not wild or barbaric enough to be interesting, nor
yet civilized enough for comfort.

Of course the officers stationed in Cebu, and their respective families, were delightful people,
who varied the monotony of their existence with tennis, drives, little dinners, and once, I
believe, even a ball was indulged in. There was an excellent club and reading-room for the
men, and every week, on ladies' day, the women donned their prettiest frocks, and chatted over
their teacups on the club veranda, quite as if they were not hundreds of miles away from everything
that makes life bearable.

Cebu is a town with a past, like the Ibsen woman; it also has a future; but at present it is
in the transmigratory period between the two, and is in consequence odious. The place is chiefly
interesting because it is the oldest town in the archipelago settled by Europeans, and one
revels in its queer, moss-grown churches and conventos, each of them said to be the most ancient
edifice in the Islands. This occasions much amicable dispute among the different religious
orders of Cebu, and it is really edifying to hear them mildly slander one another, as they
give conclusive evidence why their particular building is far older than some other for which
is claimed that not always enviable distinction.

Not far from the shore stands an octagonal chapel or oratory, said to be built on the very
spot where the first mass was celebrated after the landing of Magellan. Even the old stone
fort is claimed by some earnest prevaricators as a relic of those early Spanish days, but as
the architecture is clearly that of the eighteenth century we took the liberty of doubting
the veracity of these statements.

As to Cebu's future, it is assured, for the harbour is excellent, and, although not large,
is well sheltered from both monsoons and has good anchorage, so the place is growing quite
rapidly and should in time rank next in importance to Manila. A number of "godowns," as large
warehouses are called in the Philippines, were in the process of construction at the time of
our visit, and so many industrial and commercial improvements were being inaugurated that my
little note-book reads like a leaf from a geography--"manufactures--imports--exports--chief
industries," and the like. As for climate, it was hot, is hot, and will be hot on into infinity.

Had it not been for the Santo Niño, I fear our memories of the place would have been purely
statistical, a perfect orgy of useful information. But the Santo Niño saved the day, though
it was not until our last visit to Cebu that most of us saw this image so famous among the
island group. Calling upon the Philippine fathers in charge of the Santo Niño convent, and
stating our interest in the Santo Niño itself, we were received with the utmost cordiality.
Were we Catholics? No? Ah, that was too bad. But, yes, of course we could see the Santo Niño.
People often came all the way from Manila just for that. And then we were taken into the clean,
barely furnished drawing-room of the convento, where an anticipatory refreshment was served,
the while we were regaled with a history of Cebu's famous image. This refection consisted of
a wee glass of delicious Muscatelle apiece and some crisp, very rich cakes made by the sisters
of a neighbouring convent, and as we ate and drank, a fat, jolly old padre, who thought he
could speak English, tried to tell us about the Santo Niño in that language. As his enthusiasm
and interest increased, he often forgot to use his newly acquired tongue and lapsed into Spanish,
which was far more comprehensible to us than was his sublime disregard of syntax when attempting
Anglo-Saxon, notwithstanding the fact that he tried to better his linguistic efforts by shouting
out each English sentence like a phonograph gone mad. It was from him we first heard the legend
of the Santo Niño--how it was an idol in the old days, worshipped by savage Visayans, and how,
after the advent of the Spaniards with Magellan, there was a great fire in the town, everything
in one populous section being burned, save a little nipa shack in which stood the wooden idol.
On every side buildings crashed down, sending showers of sparks over the inflammable thatched
roof of the nipa house. A monsoon was blowing at the time, which fanned the flames into so
fierce a blaze that finally all attempts were abandoned to save property in that section of
the town, and people fled to the woods with the few belongings they could gather together,
there to watch the cruel flames spreading in every direction.

It is probable that Cebu would have gone up in smoke had it not been that the monsoon brought
on its wings a fierce tropical rain that beat down upon the burning city and quenched the fire.
But in that section where it had raged hottest, nothing was left standing save the little nipa
shack already mentioned. Around it were the ruins of pretentious Spanish houses, across its
threshold lay a smouldering, blackened piece of wood, which alone should have converted it
into cinders. But there it stood unharmed, not even scorched by the fierce heat to which it
had been subjected, and within its walls the Visayan idol smiled down on the curious crowd,
with a superhuman intelligence. Recognizing at once its miraculous powers, the Spanish priests
obtained it from the savages for a mere bagatelle, and enshrined it in their Catholic chapel
as the Santo Niño of Cebu. Blessed by the presence of so holy a thing, the little chapel grew
and prospered until a handsome stone church and convento were built, the church being the very
one where the image now stands.

Other stories have it that some time during the sixteenth century, a Spanish sailor found the
Santo Niño cast up on the eastern coast of Cebu after a terrific storm. On picking it up, he
was rejoiced to find that the use of his left arm, long withered by palsy, was miraculously
restored, whereupon he carried the image into Cebu with him. There numberless wonderful things
were accomplished by the Santo Niño, till at last the sailor, half frightened at possessing
so sacred an object, turned it over to the priests, who promptly enshrined it in the one Catholic
church of the place. Some fifty or sixty years later, the church was burned to the ground--for
both stones agree as to a destructive fire--and all was lost save the Santo Niño itself, which
escaped by a miracle only.

Whatever may have been its origin, many wonderful things are attributed to the Santo Niño of
Cebu. It is to him that childless women pray for offspring; to him that mothers bring their
little ones, and beg a thousand blessings upon them; from him that distracted parents beseech
renewed health and strength for their children, ill unto death with diseases that baffle the
doctors, for the Santo Niño, being but a child himself, is especially tender toward the little
ones.

It is said that once an attempt was made to send the Santo Niño to Rome, as the Pope had expressed
a wish to see the much talked of Philippine image. Very tenderly was it packed away in soft
wrappings, after which it was placed in a wooden box, fitted with an intricate lock, the key
of which was carried by the old bishop who was to accompany the Santo Niño on its travels.
To ensure the safety of so valuable a thing, the wooden box was put into a metal casket, which
in turn was fastened securely. Then the ship sailed for Italy, and the little niche in the
wall of the cathedral which had been the Santo Niño's shrine was boarded up, and the natives
came to the church but seldom, so bitter were they that the Holy Child had been taken from them.

Hard times followed; crops failed; there was an epidemic of sickness; and Cebu was shrouded
in gloom, a gloom which deepened when word came from Rome that the image was either lost or
stolen, for although the bishop had never let the sacred box out of his sight, yet when he
came to unlock it before a hushed throng at the Vatican, there was no Santo Niño within. It
was thought that in some mysterious way the bishop had been robbed and that the Holy Child
was forever lost. Great was the grief and terror and excitement in Cebu. Masses were said,
and individual prayers offered up, novenas were held, and vows taken, all to the effect that
the Santo Nino should be restored to the island.

One day, months later, while the church was being repaired, the partition of wood over the
Holy Child's shrine was accidentally knocked out of place by a workman, and what should he
discover there but the Santo Niño himself, gravely smiling, his little hands outstretched in
benediction. He had not wanted to go abroad, and so had left the carefully locked boxes and
returned to his old home. What more natural? Of course there was a great fiesta, and the miracles
performed in that week of rejoicing will never be forgotten.

But even to this day the Santo Niño gives numerous evidences of his supernatural power, and
any native will tell you how he walks abroad of a night, and visits the homes where his image
is enshrined, a tremendous undertaking, as hardly a nipa shack on the island but boasts its
picture or statue of Cebu's patron saint. On returning from these nocturnal tramps, the Holy
Child is wont to bring back with him food and drink for his own consumption, the evidence of
these midnight feasts being found on many a morning in the shape of crumbs scattered over the
altar, a touch of nature which makes him indeed kin to the natives, who, we were told, invariably
save a bit from their scanty suppers, putting it where the Santo Niño will be sure to find
it does he honour them with a visit.

But at last we were to see the Santo Niño for ourselves, and as we left the reception-room
and passed down a long corridor, hung with atrocious native paintings of Christian martyrs
in every degree of discomfort and uneasiness, through a wide refectory with three great dining
tables, the top of each being a solid piece of wood, and finally into the chapel itself, I
plead guilty to a distinct thrill of interest in every Protestant pulse.

The chapel was a large, rather bare room, with an altar to the Virgin on one side, and directly
opposite it a small shrine painted white and picked out with gold. This shrine was locked,
and as one of the little altar boys unfastened the double doors, we noticed the pictures on
either side. To the left was Saint Joseph with the child Jesus in his arms; on the right, Mary,
sweet and sad-eyed, the premonition of Gethsemane in her tender smile.

When the white doors had been unlocked and lifted off their hinges, a door of silver was discovered.
On being opened, it revealed an interior so rich as to surprise a simultaneous exclamation
of delight from us all. Gold and silver predominated in the decorations, and in the midst of
this splendour stood a little figure about twelve or fourteen inches high, its back turned
toward us as it faced the dark interior of the church so far below. A pale blue curtain was
drawn over the front of the shrine, but we fortunate ones in the little chapel were looking
at the Holy Child more intimately; from the back, to be sure, but so close that we could have
touched him with our hands.

On the day of our visit the little figure was attired in a flowing coronation robe of crimson
velvet, richly encrusted with elaborate gold embroidery, and while we were admiring this work
of art, the priest slowly and very reverently turned the Holy Child around on his pedestal
until he faced us squarely.

He is not beautiful--the Santo Niño--nor does he even faintly resemble our conception of the
Christ-child. His face is flat and lifeless, carved very roughly out of some dark wood, which,
when contrasted with his rich vestments and ornamentation, seems strangely incongruous. From
out of this brown face, eyes painted a vivid blue stare straight into one's own. Around his
cheeks fall golden curls. This is not a figure of speech, but a reality, for the curls are
of solid metal, the locks of hair being pressed into it like the china hair on the dolls of
our childhood.

These golden locks were surmounted by a golden crown. In one wooden hand he held a golden globe
with the cross of Catholicism above it, and in the other a golden staff, both of his hands
being covered by long golden gauntlets. Right under his feet, which I have no doubt were booted
in that precious metal, although they were hidden by the coronation robe, was a gold encrusted
medallion containing the tiny bone relics of eight Christian martyrs. Never have I seen anything
so barbarically splendid as that little Santo Niño, with his brown wooden face and bright blue
eyes, for all the shining metal surrounding him was real, and not a specious tinsel masquerading
as something of value.

Legend has it that originally, when the Santo Niño was a Visayan idol, it, too, was made of
gold, and not of wood as it is to-day. It seems that after its conversion to Catholicism, on
Magellan's arrival in Cebu, it was sent to Spain at the request of that pious king, Charles
the Fifth, where many extraordinary performances were accredited to it, perhaps the most miraculous
and unaccountable thing of all being that on its return to Cebu, the people found it had changed
itself en route from gold to wood, a reversal of alchemy strangely defective in wisdom on the
part of the Santo Niño. Though, indeed, the transmutation may have been entirely without his
volition, in which case it is small wonder that the Holy Child objected so strongly to a subsequent
visit on the Continent.

At one side of this very elaborate shrine of gold and silver stood a small tin box in which
one was expected to place his contribution to the Santo Niño. We paid handsomely for our glimpse
of it, saw the little figure turned slowly around on its pedestal so that it again faced the
church below, saw the silver door locked and the two white removable outside doors placed in
position, and then somewhat reluctantly left.

Once down the broad stairway of the convento, whose massive hand-rail of carved ebony would
make the heart of a collector leap for joy, we stepped into the church where many natives knelt
in prayer, glancing up reverently now and then at the tiny shrine so far above their heads.
In front of it the blue silk curtains were fast drawn, for except on holy days, it takes at
least a peso to see the Santo Niño face to face.

On the following morning two of the padres from the convento returned our call, and evinced
the most satisfying interest in all that was shown them aboard ship. Everything delighted them,
and they even gathered up the long skirts of their cassocks, and grasped their birettas firmly
in one hand, preparatory to descending into the noisome cable-tanks, should it be demanded
of them. When the ship had been inspected, we all returned to the quarter-deck, where refreshments
were served, the while we showed our guests some photographs of America.

As Manila had heretofore represented to these native priests the apotheosis of urban magnitude,
it may well be imagined how delighted they were with their first glimpse of our larger cities.
How excitedly they talked and gesticulated over the elevated railways and cable-cars; the height
of the buildings; the suspension bridges; the magnificent private residences, which at first
it was hard to convince them were not in reality hotels; the theatres, parks, and churches,
though they shook their heads sadly at so many of Protestant denomination. When, however, they
were told how many Catholic churches were in New York alone, they regained their lost interest,
and grew more enthusiastic than ever, while the English-speaking padre, in his excitement,
fairly screamed his uncertain vocabulary in our direction, though when he addressed his confrères
in Spanish his voice was of normal register.

A few days later, as an evidence of their enjoyment aboard ship, the padres sent each of us
a silver medal of the Santo Niño and a history of the image written in Spanish, con superior
permiso; a lithographic picture of the Holy Child in its shrine, giving but a faint idea of
its appearance; and a queer stone jar, the shape, if not the size of those in which the forty
thieves were hidden. These jars were full of those delicious pastry cakes already mentioned,
ojaldres, they are called, made by the sisters of the Convento Maria Natividad de Albero. Rich
the cookies were, and crisp, fairly melting on the tongue, but each one, wrapped in its protecting
bit of tissue-paper, was "a gastronomic delusion and a dyspeptic snare," to be treated as were
the forty thieves themselves by the implacable Ali Baba.

It is not at all impossible that some of our distaste for Cebu arose from the fact that, on
the several occasions of our visits there, we were coaling, a circumstance which would detract
from the Pearly City itself. No sooner were we at anchor than huge cascos came alongside and
the coaling would begin.

Inky black shapes flitted back and forth through great clouds of dust, each carrying a basket
on its head. Hoarse commands were shouted, demoniacal voices answered somewhere from the pit,
and then would come a period of comparative quiet, followed by what seemed to be a burst of
frenzied rage from the different lighters, though in reality I believe the natives were on
the best of terms, and were just inviting each other to dinner. This state of affairs continued
without intermission for eight days on each of our several visits there. For eight days the
soot fell alike on the quarter-deck and the forecastle. The ship became a black abomination.
The very towels in our staterooms left grimy, unpremeditated streaks on face and hands.

During this period I do protest that we suffered those torments usually reserved for the unregenerate,
and as the furnace over which the town is built was several degrees hotter each trip than on
the previous visit, we were thus precluded from going ashore to either of the badly managed
hotels for which the place is infamous.

So dangerous was the country around Cebu in those days that one afternoon on a little drive
to an encampment about four miles from the town, we were escorted there and back by a guard
of armed soldiers on horseback, some of them heading the cavalcade, the others bringing up
the rear. It was a most unusual day for Cebu, as the slightly overcast sky made the temperature
quite endurable. The country passed on our drive was unusually fine, with its groves of palms
and plantains; its tall cottonwood-trees by the road-side, the ripe pods on the bare branches
bursting and showing the soft, white fluff within; its giant mango-trees with bonfires built
beneath them, as a quick method of ripening the fruit for market. Then there were acres of
corn and fields of rice ready for harvesting, proving conclusively, as some one suggested,
that the natives of Cebu could raise something besides h---, though he had never believed it
before.

At our destination we were cordially welcomed by the officers of the infantry company stationed
there, a native band shrilled its salute, and the big American soldiers stopped their preparations
for an approaching march against the enemy to stare at us long and undisguisedly. There were
several women among us, a rare departure in those days, one of them being the wife of the young
captain who was to command the detachment going into the field that night. She had arrived
from America but a few days before, bringing with her a splendid boy nearly three years old,
whom up to that time the young father had never seen. Even after so long a separation the husband
and wife were together but seldom, as she was obliged to live in town because of insurrectionary
troubles, nor did she ever know from day to day what the next tidings might be from the little
camp of San Nicolas.

Before our return to Cebu the officers took us to see the fortifications made by the Spaniards
after Admiral Dewey's victory in Manila Bay, fortifications they expected to use as a last
defence against invading Americans. Not far from these earthworks was an old nipa church, most
picturesque in its decay. It was nipa within as well as without, the floor and ceiling being
of braided bamboo and the walls of the nipa-palm. Its high altar was innocent of any attempt
at decoration save for some faded paper flowers stuck into empty beer bottles, while the niche
above was unfilled by patron saint of any description. At the very door grazed a lean carabao,
completing a picture of the desolation and ruin in the wake of an army.

And now as to cable work, for even here, where we had expected only to coal, the Signal Corps
was kept busy, as it was found on investigation that an old cable landing two miles up the
beach at Mabola was in such bad condition and the line so insecure that the cable must be put
directly into the Cebu office, thus avoiding the defect of a shaky land terminal. So prisoners
were engaged to dig a trench from the office to the beach, where the cable was landed, after
which it was placed in the trench and so laid up to the very door of the telegraph station,
the lead covered wire being inserted there into an iron tube lashed to an upright pole, and
thence into the window where the operator had his desk. Surely a novel way to lay a shore end!
It reminded one of that nice old lady's suggestion to the London Times in 1858, just after
the Atlantic cable failure, that in future it should be laid above the ocean instead of in
it, mentioning that in her opinion the rock of Gibraltar, peak of Teneriffe, and the Andes
should be used as points of suspension.

This work, coupled with the entire refitting of the office, took several days, and meanwhile
on board ship the cable was being turned over from one tank to the other in search of faults,
and numerous experiments were made in splicing, so that much learned conversation might be
heard anent the necessity of homogeneity in core joints and the like.

On February 3d we left Cebu for Liloan, island of Cebu, where a cable put in eleven months
before needed repairing. After a two hours' run we anchored off our destination, which proved
to be a most deserted little hole, rich in vegetation only. There were but a few men, commanded
by a non-commissioned officer at Liloan, and as our stay there was to be very brief, only the
Signal Corps detachment went ashore. By one o'clock the defective splice in the trench had
been cut out, a new one made, and the office overhauled, after which, as the tests showed the
cable working satisfactorily at its Cebu end, but unsatisfactorily at the other, we sailed
for Ormoc, Leyte, arriving there about seven o'clock that evening.

On the following morning the Signal Corps men went ashore in a small boat, and while some of
the party rehabilitated the office, others underran the cable, cut in near the shore end, and
after finding communication satisfactory with Cebu and Liloan, located the fault, the ship's
volt-meter indicating when the small boat underrunning the cable came to the break. It proved
to be a defective factory joint, which was cut out and repaired, so that by three o'clock communication
was established between Cebu and Liloan.

Ormoc did not prove interesting enough for a trip ashore in the hot sun, so my only recollection
of the place is a white tribunal and a great preponderance of green foliage, toned down by
the dull gray-brown of nipa buildings and the dull gray-blue of sky and sea.

Then, too, it will always bring to mind the sad experience of a very delightful officer we
met there. At the time of our visit he was en route to Northern Leyte, a hostile part of the
island where several hundred insurgents were strongly entrenched. With him were fifty soldiers,
all of them eager for a scrap, while the young fellow himself was "insatiable of glory." We
were everyone of us enthused by his prospects, the officers perhaps a bit envious of the stirring
times ahead for him, the women fearful of the outcome with such tremendous odds in favour of
the well entrenched Filipinos.

On a subsequent visit to Cebu we heard the last deplorable chapter of his little story, the
beginning of which had so interested us, for while there had been no loss of life in his command,
the whole expedition had been a complete failure. It seems he was vanquished, disarmed, and
routed by the enemy at every turn, notwithstanding the fact that he had studied strategy so
that his plans of employing and combining his resources would have filled any general officer
with admiration. Nor did his overthrow have the merit of dignity. It was irresistibly droll,
and no one laughed more heartily at the preposterous ending of the expedition than did the
victim himself.

For according to his own story at every town and village in the enemy's country, he and his
brave followers, all of them thirsting for gore, were met by a brass band, and, accompanied
by the leading citizens of the place, were marched down the principal street with great pomp
and ceremony to where a fiesta in honour of the great American captain was in progress. There
the people, in gala-attire, clapped their hands and called "Viva, viva," at their discomfited
enemy, and later in the day a great banquet would be given, at which the leading citizens threw
oral bouquets at their disgusted prisoner, while the soldiers walked disconsolately around
the little village they had expected to conquer. Had fate not willed it otherwise the captain
might have rendered such distinguished service as would have merited at least recognition from
Congress, perhaps a medal of honour, or even the star of a brigadier; while now all he can
expect from a grateful country is some slight acknowledgment of his undoubted heroism in partaking
of the food at the natives banquets, surely an intrepid performance!

After an eight hours' run from Ormoc we reached Cebu, remaining there just long enough to put
ashore some iron poles for the construction of a cross-country line to Oslob, Cebu, where it
was intended to land the cable from Dumaguete; then sailed for Misamis, where we completed
the ill-fated Lintogup line, finding that the break in the cable was caused by the Disgrace's
propeller on that memorable trip in January.

The day was wet, and raw, and gray, and we could see the beach strewn with trees and timber,
the thatched roof of a bamboo house, and all the aftermath of a terrible storm that had swept
over the islands five days before, and of which we, in the safe shelter of Cebu's harbour,
were ignorant. It was here we were told by cable that the line from Iligan to Cagayan had not
been working since the storm had torn up the wharf and beach at the former place a week before,
so the next morning we sailed for Iligan again, feeling as blue as the day itself.

Arriving off our destination some three hours later, a party, shivering in the misty rain,
was sent ashore to ascertain the trouble. After careful tests it was found to have been caused
by a submarine landslide which had crushed a part of the cable, laid by necessity on a steep
hill under water.

So for a whole day we grappled there near Iligan, "fishing for bights," as the punster on board
called it, and surely even Izaak Walton's piscatorial patience would have been tried on this
fishing trip. Once after having successfully hooked the cable, it broke as we were drawing
it in, and only one end came on board. It was the shore end, and through it we spoke Iligan,
finding the cable satisfactory in that direction. So we buoyed the shore end and continued
our fishing with the heavy tackle. For hours we unsuccessfully lowered the massive grapnel
iron, where our charts indicated the cable should be, but without success until late in the
afternoon, when the strain on the dynamometer indicated another "bight."

Then it was pulled up very slowly, for we could not afford to have it break a second time,
when suddenly it slipped the grapnel and was again lost at the sea-bottom. As it was getting
dark we put lights on our two buoys, one placed where the cable had slipped the grapnel, the
other, as I said before, attached to the captured end. Now it is by no means easy to jump from
a small boat to a buoy in such rough water as that in Iligan harbour, and we watchers on the
ship felt some little uneasiness until the lights from both buoys proclaimed that it had been
accomplished by the young native who always did that work.

In the morning our scientific fishermen were rewarded for their patience. They had a bite,
and everyone on board watched with interest the heavy machinery as it slowly and steadily pulled
the sea end of the cable out of the water. It was hooked at half after eight, and not until
an hour later was it landed, the dynamometer showing a strain at times of from one to two tons.

Immediately after getting the cable on board, Cagayan was called over and over again without
response, which would have indicated that the trouble was farther out at sea, had not tests
shown the resistances were what they should have been, from which it was easily inferred that
the operator at Cagayan was not attending strictly to business. "Gone to Sunday school, probably!"
ironically observed the Powers-that-Be, chewing the end of an unlighted cigar, as he always
did when worried, and, Sunday though it was, we felt the sarcasm to be a just one, Sunday schools
not being a chief industry of Cagayan.

Reasoning on the premise that all was right at that end of the line, the splice was made, and
we paid out the cable until reaching the buoyed shore end, which in turn was spliced to the
deep-sea cable, and the bight dropped overboard. Then a Signal Corps man returning from shore
reported all communicating lines in good order, at which there was great rejoicing on board
the Burnside, and, our Cagayan friend having condescended meanwhile to communicate with us,
we were soon under way for Zamboanga, Mindanao.

The next day was a perfect one for sailing, and eventful, in that while turning over cable
the long objurgated fault in the tanks came to light, proving to be the result of carelessness
on the part of the manufacturer, a carelessness which had caused much agony of mind to the
Signal Corps, and many groans and imprecations from all concerned. But at last the fault was
cut out, and a nice healthy splice substituted by the reparative surgery which has been so
often mentioned.

It seemed such a small thing, the fault, only a little break in the armour wire, and yet it
had induced the most severe nerve paralysis in that sentient thread of copper in the cable's
centre. "Words and words of men" could not "flicker and flutter and beat" until the wound had
been healed, which was promptly done, accompanied by vigorous language concerning the aforesaid
careless manufacturer.

Chapter VII

ZAMBOANGA

Zamboanga! The very name brings back our first daylight glimpse of Mindanao's principal town--an
adorable water-colour sketch, what with the soft, deep blue of sky and sea, the tropical freshness
of green foliage, amidst which nestled picturesque white houses with overhanging balconies,
the red and blue sails on the sunlit water, and to the right of the picture an old Spanish
fort, gray and stern and forbidding.

This old fort, aside from its undoubted pictorial charm, is historically interesting, in that
it is a relic of the seventeenth century and of those first Spanish governors, martially ambitious,
who stirred up wars with the Moros for their own personal aggrandizement, wars which have been
protracted through two bloody centuries.

Zamboanga seems so peaceful at present that it is hard to believe it was ever otherwise. All
around the town stretch fine lands, much better cultivated than any we had seen on the trip,
with here and there beautiful groves, now of cocoanut-palms, now of mangoes, interspersed by
well ploughed paddy fields and acres of corn or sugar-cane. The town natives were extremely
friendly and when passing always saluted us deferentially, while in the country the children,
and sometimes the grown people as well, yelled cheerily after our carriage, "Hellojohn, hellojohn,"
evidently under the impression that Hello, John, was one word, and a salutation of great respect
as well as a sociable greeting.

No one wore arms around Zamboanga, in fact it was forbidden so to do; and the smiling, well-disposed
natives testified highly to the efficiency of the American officer in command, the sight of
whose jolly face brought ecstatic yells of recognition from the very babies, bare and dirty,
tumbling around in the streets, greetings which the colonel always answered in kind, his eyes
twinkling with amusement the while.

Most of our success with these southern Moros may be traced to religious tolerance, and the
fact that we interfere with them only in their disturbance of non-Mohammedan neighbours. Slave
raids are a thing of the past, and leading dattos have been notified that any piratical or
fanatical incursions into American territory will be punished swiftly and surely.

It has also behooved us to respect their race prejudice, to be considerate of their religious
idiosyncrasies, and to dispense justice untempered with mercy, the latter virtue being considered
a weakness in the eyes of our Mohammedan brothers, and as such to be taken advantage of. The
border troubles in India, the mutiny of '57, the Turkish atrocities in '95, the Pathan rising
under Mad Mullah in '97, the French-Algerian difficulties, and the ever present reminder of
Spain's three hundred years of struggle for supremacy in the Philippines, all serve as mile-posts
on the road to good government.

Although thus far we have made no little progress in the right direction, the path has not
been strewn with roses, for Mohammedan customs, prohibitions, and theories of living are so
strange to a North American intellect that mistakes are liable to occur at any moment. For
example, it is a deadly insult for a man to even touch a Mohammedan woman not belonging to
his harem, or to pay her the most conventional or trivial compliment. Then, too, as everyone
knows, their dietetic observances are of the greatest import, and a good Mohammedan will not
only refrain from eating pork, but will not hunt the wild boar or help carry it home for fear
the contact might defile him. Wine is of course forbidden, though I have heard that in the
Philippines food over which the shadow of an unbeliever has passed need not be thrown away,
the Moros there being more thrifty and perhaps less fanatically devout than their brothers
in India.

For some strange reason these people have taken most kindly to the Americans, though I am pained
to confess that much of their liking is due to the fact that they think we are not Christians,
our brand of religion being unlike that of Catholic Spain. This, coupled with the fact that
in several instances we have been forced, by a lack of quarters, to shelter our soldiers in
church or cathedral, has so strengthened them in their belief that Juramentados, or Mohammedans
sworn to kill Christians, are without employment, it being obviously unwise to run amuck and
kill, when the Holy Writ promises reward only to those dying while destroying followers of
Christianity.

Many American customs that do not entrench on the Holy Law have been adopted with no little
avidity by the Moros, and the Stars and Stripes float over the home of every native fortunate
enough to possess a flag. This is particularly noticeable in and around Zamboanga, but an officer
belonging to the regiment stationed there told us a tale illustrating the Moro's love for things
American, that reads like a romance.

It seems that the post assigned to this officer's battalion was at Davao, in the southeastern
part of the island, a wild and seldom visited country, whose inhabitants consist of a curious
mixture of Christians, Mohammedans, and Pagans. In the mountains surrounding the town live
numerous Pagan tribes, all speaking different dialects, and wild as the country itself. Having
occasion to make a reconnoissance trip in this territory, the officer and his escort stopped
overnight in a little village of Bogobos, whose chief did the honours with a savage dignity.

The town was dirty beyond belief, the natives were lazy even in their curiosity, and everything
pertaining to the place was in a shocking state of disrepair. Among other items of interest,
proudly pointed out to the American officer by his host, was a gruesome collection of human
skulls, which decorated the dwelling both indoors and out. "Trophies of war," he explained
nonchalantly to his astonished guest, merely the skulls of his enemies. The American, with
involuntary loathing, simulated a polite interest in these ghastly evidences of raids on the
lower villages, and that night slept none too soundly in consequence. The following morning,
on leaving, he thanked the chief for his hospitality, and asked him to some day return the visit.

Nothing loath, the savage accepted the invitation, and a short time later arrived in Davao,
accompanied not by a paltry half-dozen as escort, but by the major part of his tribe. He was
evidently not going to be outdone in ceremonial observances, and he and his followers remained
long enough in Davao to cause the official larder sadly to need replenishment. During this
visit the Bogobos were one and all delighted with the military life of the post; with the drills
and parades where the soldiers marched as one man; the evolutions wherein they were deployed,
moved in echelon, or wheeled into position; and their sureness and quickness in the manual
of arms. Then, too, the cleanliness of the barracks impressed them, and the personal neatness
of the khaki-clad men, not to mention the very desirable things to eat evolved by the company cook.

But perhaps nothing so filled them with awe and admiration as the ceremonial raising and lowering
of the garrison flag. They never missed the opportunity of seeing it, especially at evening,
when the improvised band played the "Star Spangled Banner" and the flag fluttered slowly down
the staff, while the troops stood at attention with bared heads. It was so solemn an occasion
that the very heavens darkened before it, and night was upon them always ere they half suspected
it.

So impressed was the chief with this ceremony that on leaving Davao he asked the officer commanding
the battalion if he would give him an American flag, that he might take the beautiful custom
into his own village. This request was granted, and the presentation of the Stars and Stripes
was made the occasion for a little sermon, in which the head of the Bogobos was informed that
he and his people were under the protection of that flag, which represented the great American
government, and that he, as chief of the tribe, stood for American authority in his village,
so that it would become him to set an example to his people of humanity, liberality, and all
civilized observances.

Then, with great tact and diplomacy, he was further informed that in the United States the
custom of decorating houses with human skulls no longer prevailed; it had fallen into disfavour
with the more enlightened "Natives" of the country and, in fact, they seriously objected to
such practices. Consequently, as a representative of the American government, he must keep
abreast of the times in this regard. The chief listened very gravely and with never a word
to the little disquisition, while it was hard to tell from his expression if his silence meant
only savage taciturnity, or if he were really deeply moved.

On a subsequent visit to the Bogobos, however, the officer was greatly surprised to see what
weight his words had carried and to note the effect of the Star Spangled Banner upon a savage
mountain people. Soldiers were drilling under the green trees; modern sanitation had been adopted;
sweeping, heretofore unknown, was a custom of the village; the highly objectionable skulls
had been removed from the executive mansion; while every evening the chief and his standing
army failed not to face the splendid Stars and Stripes as they were reverently lowered from
a bamboo flagstaff, where during the day they floated over a village redeemed by them from
seemingly hopeless savagery.

On our first visit to Zamboanga we remained a day only, for by evening our shore end was laid
and the office established, so that at daybreak the next morning we sailed for Tukuran, Mindanao,
thus deferring our intercourse with Zamboanga, though not terminating it. After laying a hundred-knot
stretch of cable between there and Point Flecha, we began to take soundings, and for four days
sailed back and forth between Tukuran and the Point, seeking water not too deep for cable laying,
though in places the sea swallowed up our sounding wire for twelve hundred fathoms. Think of
it--a mile and a quarter! And once the iron marker came up on a sun-baked deck icy-cold from
its abysmal plunge.

But at last a suitable course was chosen, and on the afternoon of February 16th we anchored
off Tukuran. A prettier bit of country it would be hard to find. Hills on every side--forest
hills--as far as the eye could reach, while a road, looking from the ship like a narrow white
ribbon, trailed from the shore straight up the green hills to a stone wall, behind which was
stationed a company of American soldiers.

The next morning early most of us went ashore, despite the winding ribbon of a road which from
the ship looked even more formidable than it really was. As we neared the land in the ship's
launch two Moro boats anchored near the beach attracted our attention, the most absurdly picturesque
crafts one could well imagine, with curving prows of rudely carved wood, outriggers of bamboo,
and a thatched roof or awning at one end. A gaily coloured hat hung from one of the boats,
and over each floated a red flag shaped like an isosceles triangle. These flags were finished
by a white border ruffled on all around, such ruffles as we put on window-curtains in America,
and over one of the crafts floated the striped red and white flag of the Mindanao Moro.

On reaching the post we found that the boats belonged to two prominent dattos visiting there.
One of these dignitaries was an old, toothless man, with a mighty following, two or three of
his army even carrying rifles and the others gigantic spears. The second datto was much younger,
and repaired to the officers' quarters to wait until the old chap had departed, evidently recognizing
his own social inferiority, for he boasted half a dozen warriors only, and not a gun or spear
among them, though they carried barongs of great beauty, with damascened blades and handles
of handsomely carved wood, some of them being inlaid with pearl or ivory.

Each of the chiefs and all their followers were dressed in the picturesque Moro costume, which
we had seen first in Misamis and Iligan, and all of them were frankly curious over the American
women. They discussed us freely to our very faces, and kept changing their positions to get
a better view of us, staring with amazement when the old datto was brought up and introduced.
How curious of the Americans not to know that a woman should be taken to a datto, not a datto
to a woman. And then, too, how odd that they should shake hands just like men, and not cover
their faces at all, and what remarkable hair the child had, just the colour of hemp, and how
very, very tall she was, though the interpreter insisted she was but nine years old.

Nor was this curiosity confined to the natives by any manner of means, for officers and soldiers
alike crowded around us, and one non-commissioned officer took a snapshot of the group, explaining
later to his captain, who took him to task for his boldness, that he had meant no harm, but
just wanted the picture as a reminder of what American women really looked like, not having
seen one before in two years. Needless to say he was forgiven, his interest being subjective
rather than objective.

We were told in Tukuran that when the troops first went there deer were so plentiful that the
pretty, shy animals could be seen at any time of day around the garrison, while at night they
would come so close to the barracks as to annoy the men, barking not unlike dogs, and stumbling
over kettles and pots by the door of the company kitchen. I do not know that they ever became
so annoying that the men had to resort to the cat-discouraging bootjack or soda bottle, but
I do know that those Tukuran soldiers had so much venison that they would eat canned corned
beef or bacon in preference. Good hunting stories were of course numerous, and some of these
so fired the Nimrod of the trip--our major-quartermaster--that he set off at daybreak one morning,
gun in hand, accompanied by the crack shot among the soldiers of Tukuran, each prepared to
slay his tens of thousands. But although the two men tramped the hills from sunrise until dark
they saw no deer, and all because the search-light from the ship on the previous night had
frightened them away from their accustomed haunts. At least so said the officers on shore,
an explanation at which we Burnside people sniffed, though feasting on venison at the time.
But before we reached Zamboanga, a Signal Corps man, whom we left behind at Tukuran to complete
the establishment of the lines there, sent a message to the major over the cable we were then
laying, to the effect that he had seen a herd of deer from the window of his telegraph office
that very morning, and, being a cable-ship man, and so not in league with the Ananiases of
Tukuran, the major must fain believe him, whereupon he made some remarks not worthy of record.

Before leaving Tukuran one of the officers belonging to the Signal Corps well-nigh lost his
reputation for veracity, or sobriety, by coming back to the ship one day with a most amazing
tale as to some fish he had seen promenading--promenading, forsooth!--on the beach. Everyone
was hilariously skeptical. Some shook their heads with mock commiseration and hinted darkly
that much learning had made him mad, while still others wondered audibly how any man, no matter
how vinaceous his tendencies, could have seen fish walk so early in the day. Only one among
us all believed him, and she was obliged to--legally.

"Were they exercising for their health?" queried a scoffer, with what he was pleased to consider
fine irony. "Undoubtedly," responded the hitherto veracious one, with unabated good humour,
"though perhaps one might more truthfully say they were walking less to gain an appetite than
to find the means wherewith to satisfy it." He then described these piscatorial pedestrians
as small, dark fish with little bead-like eyes in the top of their heads, and a blunt nose--he
called it a nose, I am not guilty. Moreover, their ventral fins were largely developed, and
by this means the fish hopped, or rather, hitched along the sand, after the manner of seals.

It was a preposterous tale, and nothing would do but that the cable-ship Munchausen should
take a party ashore where all might witness the fish of Tukuran taking a constitutional on
the beach, after the manner of the oysters in "The Walrus and the Carpenter." Nothing daunted,
the officer agreed to the proposition, and so confident was he that even Mrs. Munchausen became
less apologetically sure of his infallibility. But on our arrival at the beach, not a fish
was to be seen, and loud was the laughter at both Munchausens, and numerous the jokes at their
expense.

However, the tide going out a little later discovered on the wet sand a multitude of small
walking-fish, and thus spared a reputation, and at the same time saved to science a story that
else might have been laughed out of existence. Text-books tell of India's walking-fish, but
I have been able to find nothing as to the walking-fish of the Philippines. In Luzon, during
the rainy season, it is no uncommon sight to see natives casting their nets in the overflowed
rice-fields, though perhaps but a few days before the ground there had been caked hard and
dry from the sun. In this latter instance, it is more than probable that the fish do not walk
back and forth, but bury themselves in the ground at the beginning of the hot season, remaining
there until the first rains call them out in great numbers.

The Signal Corps found the trench at Tukuran a difficult problem in that it had to be dug down
a very steep hill leading from the stone-enclosed fort to the beach, but by evening of the
first day this was accomplished, and the shore end laid and buoyed. The next morning we left
Tukuran, seeking better soundings than we had at first obtained, but finding the water nearly
as deep in one place as another, it was decided to leave at sunrise on the following day and
lay the cable as best we could.

All went well until late in the afternoon, when communication with Tukuran was suddenly interrupted,
whereupon we hauled in several miles of cable, and coming upon the fault, cut it out and "spoke"
Tukuran. By this time it was so late that the Signal Corps realized it would be impossible
to sight the buoy at Flecha Point that night, though it was then but fifteen knots away, and
so we lay to until morning.

As it was out of the question for the heavy cable to hang pendent from the stern of the ship
all night at the mercy of the propeller; and as the three buoys were in use, there was one
thing only to be done, and that was to fasten the cable to a small boat, with enough men to
keep the craft bailed of water. It was a more hazardous proceeding than it sounds, for had
a heavy squall come up, the boat, with nearly a ton of cable fastened to it, would surely have
sunk. But notwithstanding this, one of the civilian cable experts, the able cable seaman, and
three natives spent a most uncomfortable night afloat.

Before leaving the ship, the Americans joked about their possible fate, as Americans will,
while the natives, on going down the gangway, crossed themselves and commended their souls
to the Virgin, each race brave and stout-hearted in its own fashion. To be sure, they carried
with them life-preservers and signals in case of accident, while the ship stayed as near the
little twinkling lights on the small boat as possible, like some big mother hen hovering over
her only chick.

The next morning the buoy at Flecha Point was picked up, the splice made, and the journey to
Zamboanga continued. On the afternoon of February 21st, after making the final splice twelve
miles out, we sailed into the harbour, to learn that the cable was working successfully in
every detail, and that the natives of the town were overjoyed to be in communication with the
world. The great event was celebrated on board by a jolly dinner, to which many officers from
shore were bidden, after which we sat up on the quarter-deck until very late, exchanging home
news and gossip some six or seven weeks old, while a round and red tropic moon hung in the
heavens like a Japanese lantern, and the torchlights of innumerable fishing smacks bobbed up
and down, as the natives speared for fish in the dark waters of the bay.

The next morning was Washington's Birthday, in honour of which the ship was dressed, and, more
wonderful still, a holiday declared for all hands aboard, the first one since leaving Manila,
This was principally due to the fact that at this particular juncture a day more or less made
no appreciable difference in the outcome, while at Christmas and New Year's every moment was
of import.

Even before sunrise the natives were astir in preparation for the great event. All of them
discarded their tarred clothing, appearing in natty white "Americanos" and dinky straw hats,
while some even sported swagger sticks. In the Philippines any white suit which consists of
well fitting trousers and a coat buttoning up to the throat, as contradistinguished from baggy
pantaloons with a camisa worn on the outside, is called by the natives an "Americano," and
is by them greatly admired from a sartorial standpoint.

Nearly all the Signal Corps employees, being men of social standing because of their really
princely salaries, fifteen gold dollars a month, sported such suits, which with the addition
of stockings and neat tan shoes, instead of bare feet thrust carelessly into chinelas, gave
them the appearance of belonging to the native four hundred, any one of them looking eligible
for the high office of presidente or secretario. There must have been many a flutter under
modest panuelas when the sixty young swells struck Zamboanga that day, with money sufficient
to buy unlimited sorbetas and the little rice potas so dear to the heart of Philippine maidens.

The jackies having shore leave were most picturesque, and, alas, hot as well, in their blue
flannel suits, with the round sailor cap set at a jaunty angle on their heads; while the Signal
Corps soldiers and hospital men in fresh khaki, the officers in crisp duck, and the women freshly
starched and ironed, gave a holiday aspect even beyond that of the fluttering flags aloft,
as the ship had been dressed both on Chrismas Day and New Year's, although the work had gone
on with unabated energy.

Indeed, some of the Irish sailors in the forecastle were overheard talking together that morning,
one of them saying, as he rammed his tobacco down hard in his pipe with anticipatory joy in
the smoke to come:

"Sure, not that I am complainin' at the same, but will anny of yez tell me why the ship's a-flutter
with flags, and the lads all given a holiday, and that old coffee-mill of a cable machine stopped
grinding for the once?"

"Because," answered a comrade with an expressive wink, "it's Garge's birthday, Garge Washington,
you know, the daddy of his counthry!"

"Oh, to be sure!" responded the other, meditatively, taking a whiff or two at his pipe to see
that it was really lighted before he threw the match overboard. "To be sure! And it's a great
mon that same Garge must have bin, a great mon, Dinnis. Sure, St. Pathrick himself couldn't
touch him with a shillaly."

"And for why?" demanded several Irishmen, truculently, their ire aroused at the invidiousness
of the allusion.

"Because St. Pathrick, God love him, aint never been counted as ranking alongside of Christ,
and this here Garge Washington seems to be of more importance than ayther of thim. Why, on
Christmas we didn't have no holiday--divil a bit of it--just a bite more to ate for dinner,
with no shore leave, and the haythens working us and working thimsilves all day as if it had
been an ordinary Chuesday 'stead of Christmas, which is Christ's birthday, while on Garge's
birthday the whole ship cilibrates. Ah, he certainly must have bin a great mon, that same Garge."

But notwithstanding our philosopher's grumble, he enjoyed his shore leave to the utmost, and
he and Dennis came back on the evening boat hilarious as could be and reciprocally dependent
upon one another for support.

That morning Datto Mandi, the Rajah Muda or heir to the Sultanate of Mindanao, came on board
to pay his respects to the Powers-that-Be. The datto was accompanied by his wife, for notwithstanding
he is a Mohammedan, he has but one, and the wife of his Philippine foster-brother, besides
a large retinue of followers and slaves. He also brought with him a band, and as a rival orchestra
had come out earlier, we stationed the first one in the bow of the ship, and the datto's musicians
in the stern.

All would have been well had not a spirit of emulation caused the bands to play different selections
at one and the same time, resulting in a discordant war of notes and the death of harmony.
Peace was restored by some native rushing valiantly to the front and forcibly stopping the
band on the forward deck, after which each set of musicians waited, with no little impatience,
its turn to play, and after once getting the floor, or in this case the deck, held it longer
than was quite parliamentary.

The datto proved himself a most delightful man, with an earnest, sensitive face and a manner
indicative of such innate refinement that we found ourselves most favourably contrasting him
with some of the Tagalog and Visayan dignitaries already met.

It is said that after Spain's evacuation, and before the arrival of American troops in the
southern islands, several insurgent leaders proposed to resist the landing of Americans in
Zamboanga. Datto Mandi and the Philippine presidente of the town, knowing that the American
government was unlike that of Spain, and realizing what an overwhelming defeat such a project
would ultimately receive, although the first enterprise might meet with success, did all in
their power to quell these martial aspirations.

Failing in this, war was declared, and the presidente, surrounded by a loyal few, and Datto
Mandi with his numerous Moro followers, drove the insurgents from town. Meanwhile the wives
and children of these belligerents would have starved had it not been for the datto, who, notwithstanding
the difference in their faith, looked after them all, until the discomfited warriors returned
to more peaceful pursuits.

On the first anniversary of the Americans' arrival in Zamboanga, a great fiesta was held. It
began, as all feast-days should begin, with high mass in the cathedral, after which the Mohammedans
joined their Christian friends in games and cock-fights. Verily, Datto Mandi and the presidente
had been right, Americans were unlike the Spaniards, and Zamboanga had never experienced so
peaceful a year in all her history. Small wonder the fiesta was a success, and that the "Viva
America's" were uttered from full hearts. But it is primarily to Datto Mandi and the presidente
that the people of Zamboanga should be grateful. Citizens of the world these men are, and statesmen,
too, although their sphere is comparatively circumscribed.

The presidente was ill while we were in Zamboanga, his condition being so critical that none
of us saw him, but one day while we were driving around the outskirts of the town, our coachman
drew up his horses with a great flourish before a pretty vine-embowered house.

"Why are you stopping here?" I demanded, a trifle sharply, for heads had appeared at various
windows and the situation was becoming embarrassing. The coachman turned with a dignified gesture,
if one can look dignified in a shirt thin as mosquito-netting.

"It is the house of the presidente," he said, in an injured tone. "Every American who comes
to Zamboanga wishes to be driven here. He is a very great man, the presidente."

I agreed with him heartily, if somewhat hastily, and then prevailed upon him to drive on, which
he did with melancholy resignation, disapproval expressed in every line of his body, which,
from his box, was outlined strongly against the sky through the thin white camisa, embroidered
as daintily as a girl's ball gown.

But to return to the datto. On the morning of his visit to the Burnside he wore a white "Americano"
suit and white shoes, as, indeed, did most of his followers, one of the men topping off this
very conventional attire with a magnificent red, green, and purple turban which he did not
once remove while aboard ship. The headgear of the Moros consists entirely of turbans, fezes,
or soft tam-o'-shanters, the latter a compromise, I fancy, between the hats of civilization
and the head-covering demanded by the Moslem religion.

The datto's wife was a shy little woman, with an unusually sweet voice and big, startled brown
eyes, which gave her an indescribably pathetic look. She wore her hair straight back from a
high, round forehead, and coiled it neatly at the top of her head. Her features were smaller
and more regular than those of the average native, and her pearl earrings seemed an integral
part of herself. Her frock, made after a European model--and very far after, I am obliged to
admit--fitted badly, and she eyed our summer gowns with polite interest, evidently taking notes
for a readjustment of her own wardrobe at home.

Unlike other Moro women, her teeth were white, the Zamboanga officers telling us she had the
black enamelling removed after American occupation of the town; and the only thing about her
that would have attracted attention at an American gathering was the fact that several finger-nails
on her very small hands were long, almost as long again as from the first knuckle of the finger
to the finger-tip, indicating that she was a Moro of high caste and did no manual labour of
any kind. Her clumsy Spanish slippers covered feet small as a child's, and her manner, while
shy, was quite calm and dignified.

Of course the party was taken around the ship, and all expressed a polite interest and appreciation
of what was shown them, although there was far less enthusiasm than when the more volatile
Tagalog or Visayan had seen the wonders of electricity for the first time. To be sure, the
datto himself had been to Spain, but we were told his wife had never been away from Mindanao,
nor had many of his followers travelled more extensively than to Manila and back again; notwithstanding
which they refused to be impressed or render indiscriminate approbation, however astounding,
admirable, or strange the marvels might appear.

Only the Philippine sister-in-law lacked self-control and talked volubly, grabbing the datto's
wife by the hand, and expressing herself excitedly in unintelligible Spanish or Zamboanganese,
which is a mixture of Castilian, Visayan, and Malay, Once, in an excess of emotion, she almost
hugged me. I think it was on first seeing the wonders of a bathroom, and several times she
came near enthusing the passive little "dattoess."

But this princess of the blood always controlled herself just in time, and managed to look
as indifferent as possible. Her dispassionate attitude launched me into wild tales of Farthest
America, wherein thirty-storied buildings, elevated and underground railways, beautiful theatres
and parks, cars which ran without horses or steam, and millions of inhabitants produced no
impression whatsoever, my most improbable tale being received with a diffident condescension,
equalled only by the metrical repose that stamps the caste of Vere de Vere. Given a few months
in New York or Paris, and Mindanao's future Sultana would bloom like a rose in manners and
millinery, for, despite her reserve, she is adaptable and what the Spaniards call simpática.

Datto Mandi was frankly pleased with what he saw, though unenthusiastic, and he compared Spanish
methods of government with American administration much to our advantage, saying tersely and
epigrammatically that the Spaniards promised much and accomplished little, while the Americans
promised little and accomplished much. In speaking of the cable, one of the Signal Corps officers
told the Rajah Muda that it was a gift of half a million pesos from the United States to the
Philippine Islands, at which the datto was obviously impressed. He translated this bit of information
into Malay for the benefit of his followers, the monetary item seeming to have a profound effect
upon them all, even the little wife showing a decided interest at the thought of that slimy
rubber garden hose costing such a lot of silver dollars.

Just at noon we stood on the bridge while a national salute was fired from the forward gun.
Twenty-one times the hills around Zamboanga reverberated to the warlike sound, and twenty-one
times the excitable little sister-in-law squealed with a pleasurable terror. "Madame Mandi"
lost none of her serenity, but she did not like the cannonading, and covered both ears to shut
out the sound. Moreover, she turned her back upon the guns, explaining that she feared their
flash might make her blind. Meanwhile the datto and his followers stood calmly and unflinchingly
erect with uncovered heads, to show their respect for that great American, George Washington,
who little thought that in the first year of the twentieth century his birthday would be celebrated
on American territory ten thousand miles away from the United States.

That night we dined on shore with the commanding officer, and though the mess china, silver,
and napery were not of the best, the dinner was one to remember in one's prayers. Moreover,
it was extremely well served by swift and noiseless Chinese servants, who poured the wine at
the psychologic moment, and needed no premonitory lift of the eyebrows to remind them when
a course should be taken out or brought in. Throughout the repast the regimental band played
patriotic airs, and only the consciousness of being at a formal dinner in our best clothes
restrained us from humming the music or beating time to it with fork or spoon.

The table was decorated with an ornate floral design in the centre, from which trailed wreaths
of green to every plate. It was extremely effective, and I spoke of it to one of the hosts,
who told me in a whisper that he had been rather astonished earlier in the evening by the gorgeousness
of these decorations, especially as there were no florists in Zamboanga, and on asking one
of the Chinamen where he had obtained the flowers, was not a little startled to hear that they
had been stolen from a neighbouring cemetery. I looked with admiration upon this resourceful
Celestial, and then felt mildly irritated at the completeness of the whole ménage. Dinners
by men always exasperate me. They show so clearly how unnecessary women really are in the scheme
of domestic existence.

After our black coffee and liqueur, we sat out on the broad cahida, or covered veranda running
around three sides of the house, and watched the rockets from the shore and ship replying to
each other in the clear, starlit night, while a theatrical-looking moon came up slowly out
of the bay, leaving a trail of red light on the rippling water.

The next morning we planned to call on Datto Mandi and his wife, having promised ourselves
that pleasure the afternoon before, but the day dawned so fiercely hot that I, for one, rather
wilted in my resolutions, until business called my especial Signal Corps officer to town, whereupon
I yielded to his persuasion and accompanied him, the other members of the party having left
the ship some hours before.

On disembarking, we turned directly into the Mohammedan quarter. This is just beyond the bay
to the south, and the several streets teemed with Moro inhabitants, the men and women in their
gaily coloured clothes making the place more like a water-colour sketch than ever. On the banks
of one of the many streams that intersect the town, bathers clad in a single garment held stone
jars of water above their heads and let the contents slowly trickle down over the entire body.
On the steps beside them coloured stuffs were spread to dry in the sun, giving an added splash
of green and red to the already variegated landscape.

Reaching the datto's house, we found it decorated gaily in the Moro colours for our reception,
while at the top of the stairs stood the future Sultana, petite and self-possessed, but with
more animation than on the previous day. She was genuinely glad to see us, and from the sala
we could hear the voices of our friends who had preceded us.

"So sorry we are late," I said with sudden compunction, for the decorations told their tale,
and then, as airily as I could in Spanish, "Did you think we were not coming?" The future Sultana
smiled her sweet, grave smile. "No, indeed," she said; "you promised you would come, and Americans
never break their word." The Rajah Muda came out just then and spared my guilty blushes.

He, too, was delighted to see us, and the little sister-in-law bobbed about like a distracted
butterfly, while the prospective Sultana grew almost effusive in her gracious hospitality,
and as we sat down in the sala, reached over and gave my hand a little shy caress. She was
so very pleased that we had come.

This sala, or drawing-room, was a spacious apartment, and had evidently been arranged by the
Philippine sister-in-law, as it was an exact counterpart of those in all native houses. There
was little in the room save chairs and tables, and these were all of black bamboo arranged
in two long sociable rows from every window. Between the chairs stood an occasional table,
suggestive of something eatable or drinkable to come, and on every table and nearly every chair
were sepulchral looking antimacassars of macreme cord.

Swarms of servants and slaves hung around in every available door, all of them in Moro costume,
with the exception of the small children, and they were legion, who revelled in the luxury
of bare brown skins, and, strange to say, did not look at all undressed, as would Caucasian
children under similar conditions, the dark skins rather suggesting a spontaneous covering.

These retainers of Datto Mandi seemed eminently happy, and from all we could learn, slavery
among the Moros is a sort of feudal state, the slaves having many privileges and considering
themselves always as members of the family to which they belong. They live their own lives
to a great degree, marry, and bring up their children, seeming to be considered more as followers
than servants. This probably is less true of slaves by conquest, but the hereditary bondsman
likes his fetters and would doubtless feel ill-used were he forced to work for his sustenance
rather than receive it at the hands of a liberal master.

Before we left, the little hostess, quite forgetting her shyness, showed us women many of her
native costumes, several of them being wonderfully beautiful in their rich, barbaric colours.
There were jabuls or sarongs of gaily striped cotton stuff woven by the Moros; there were European
silks and satins embroidered by natives of Zamboanga; there were brocaded stuffs from Paris,
and roughly woven fabrics of home manufacture, comprising in one garment all the colours of
the spectrum.

Two or three of the long, skirt-like sarongs the little woman tried on then and there, that
we might get the effect of them when worn; and with her creamy skin and big, dark eyes, she
looked so attractive in the barbaric colours that we could not resist telling her the Moro
dress was even more becoming than the European.

She shook her head deprecatingly at this, that she might not appear critical of our wearing-apparel,
but she stroked each native garment wistfully as if she loved it, and smiled at our approval
of the picture she made standing there in the big, sunlit room, the gaily coloured jabuls scattered
about her on the polished floor, and one more gorgeous than the rest wrapped loosely around
her, yet not quite hiding the European cut of her sleeve and collar. On every side stood women
slaves watching their mistress and her guests with amused wonder, while the little sister-in-law
became more voluble than ever and told us there were no jabuls in all Mindanao so handsome
as these.

About this time the young daughter of the house was brought in and introduced to the American
visitors. She was an attractive girl of eleven, the oldest of four children, and her dark eyes
shone with suppressed excitement as she shook everybody's hand with a gracious little manner,
and answered our many questions in her pretty, hesitating Spanish. She was a dear little thing,
and comely even from an American standpoint, with her dark eyes, thick, dark hair hanging in
a braid far below her slender waist, and a faint rose tint in her dusky cheeks. She and Half-a-Woman
were of a size, although the little Moro was full two years the older, and a very pretty picture
the children made, struggling through the medium of their imperfect Spanish to arrive at a
starting-point of mutual interest--dusky daughter of the East and fair little maid of the West.

Despite the datto's wine-forbidden code of ethics, whiskey and soda were passed to the men,
as well as fine cigars and cigarettes; and when we finally left it was to be followed to the
launch in real Arabian Nights style by two picturesque slaves carrying gifts for us all from
the future Sultan and Sultana of Mindanao--jabuls magnificently embroidered, hand-woven turbans,
and knives with silver handles--truly right royal gifts and charming mementos of a very charming
visit.

The next day, February 24th, we left Zamboanga for Sulu, laying cable as we went, instead of
having to take soundings first, the charts in this one instance being reliable. As it was the
dark of the moon, however, we made the journey very slowly, having to anchor each night and
cut and buoy the cable to prevent its fouling. By eight o'clock every morning the buoy was
picked up, the splice made, and we were under way for another uninterrupted run of ten hours,
which brought us into the harbour of Sulu on the afternoon of Tuesday, February 26th.

Chapter VIII

SULU

That popular opera "The Sultan of Sulu" has made the island of Sulu one of the most-talked-of
places on the map of our new possessions, but in the Philippines it is rarely called Sulu,
being better known by its Moro name of Jolo, this being pronounced with the accent on the last
syllable, so that it sounds not unlike that vulgar salutation of our Western World, "Hello!"

As first seen from our quarter-deck the village of Sulu was a thing of beauty, with its vivid
tints of green and gold and amethyst, its red-sailed boats on the sunlit bay, and over all
the strongly blue sky. Nor was this enchantment due entirely to distance, for on going ashore
in the late afternoon, we found the town even more attractive than we had thought it from the sea.

On drawing up to the pier in the ship's launch, all were surprised to find it built solidly
of brick and stone, a rare departure in these waters, while at one side rose a round watch-tower,
the architectural evidence of Spain's ultimate victory, after numerous and heart-breaking failures,
in establishing a fort at Sulu. Above this watch-tower, which might have been taken bodily
from the stage-setting for a melodrama, floated Old Glory against the sunset sky; Moro fishing-boats,
the breeze in their crimson sails, dotted the flushed bay; and to the north and east small,
detached islands, tinged with a translucent purple like the skin of a grape, faded into the
horizon.

Within the town's mediæval loopholed walls everything adds to this picturesque effect, for
the streets are laid out in broad boulevards, with here and there a park or plaza, riotous
with bloom; the houses are large and well built, there being no nipa shacks within the four
walls, and the only church of the place is refreshingly simple in design.

During our first morning ashore we visited the market, and found it a most interesting sight.
The Moros, in their parti-coloured raiment, were squatted on the ground in a great circle,
buying or selling fruits and vegetables, while under a covered shed at one end of the plaza
stood those dealing in fish and crustaceans of all kinds.

These marketmen were eminently good to look upon from an artistic standpoint, and as they lounged
around in groups or singly, one longed to imprison them on canvas in all the gorgeousness of
their tropical colouring. One fishmonger, whom I especially remember, sported a ravishing costume,
consisting of bright green trousers, skin-tight of course, a purple coat, and a high peaked
hat of silver, gilt, and crimson. He might better have been in comic opera than in the humble
occupation of selling crabs and lobsters.

The Moro women were particularly interested in the Burnside feminine contingent, but not to
the extent of dogging our footsteps as did the natives elsewhere, several American women in
town having helped satiate their curiosity. But they stared at us, nevertheless, with a deep
and absorbing interest, the quartermaster's wife, as usual, being the cynosure of all eyes,
because of her exceptional height and slenderness, not to mention that astounding walking-skirt,
which had apparently grown upon her, there being no visible means by which it could be put
on and off.

It was that morning most of us saw for the first time the durian, of malodorous fame, whose
taste is said to be as delicious as its smell is overpowering. The fruit was for sale in the
market at a few pennies apiece, and had banishment from Sulu not been threatened as a punishment,
I should certainly have tasted one, that I might more accurately describe it.

"If you're bound to eat one of those nasty durians," said a friend living in the town, "please
take it on the ship and have the captain anchor out farther at sea. If you attempt to open
one here, you'll have the Sanitation Committee after you hotfoot!"

So I desisted, but looked at the durians so wistfully that the Moros put them down in price
to a penny apiece, evidently thinking that monetary considerations prohibited the purchase.

In appearance the durian is green and prickly, about the size of a small melon, and even through
the tough outside rind one can notice a faint nauseating odour. It is said that when one is
opened in the market it takes but a few moments to clear the vicinity of Americans, while if
a man be courageous enough to brave the strong smell and take a bite of the fruit, his presence
will be unwelcome in polite society for some time thereafter; yet the durian is delightful
to the palate, and would doubtless be oftener eaten did not one become so steeped in its anything
but Sabean odour.

That first morning in Sulu, after a jolly breakfast with some of our army friends, a post officer
took me into the Moro village of Tuli, just south of the walled town. There we visited many
native house, climbing up steps made of circular logs, which were hard to navigate in shoes,
and in every instance the natives greeted us with the utmost cordiality.

In one of the tumble-down shacks near the sea we found the Sultana, Inchy Jamela, mother of
the present Sultan, who had preceded her son to Sulu on a little visit. She was a most repulsive
old hag, blear-eyed and skinny with blackened teeth, from which the thin lips curled away in
a chronic snarl, but she rose on her elbow from the couch where she was reclining, and shook
hands in good American fashion. Then she threw us each a pillow, indicating that we, too, should
lie down and take it easy, but we preferred our perpendicularity, and sat upright on the edge
of her couch, this being the only article of furniture in the room.

As the old lady could not speak Spanish, she leered at us pleasantly from where she lay, occasionally
muttering something in her native tongue, that might have been a tribute to our charms of mind
or person, but which sounded more like an incantation. I felt she was a veritable witch, and
at any moment expected to find myself changed into some animal or other under the baleful light
of her eyes. If she had said, "Rumpelstilzchen, rumpelstilzchen," or any other cabalistic thing
the witches in our fairy tales used to say, I should not have been surprised; and I tried to
smile as pleasantly as I knew how, for fear she would think me bad tempered, and so change
my every word into frogs and toads, instead of diamonds and rubies.

After a particularly scintillating burst of silence the Sultana offered me some buyo, or betel-nut,
to chew, and on my refusing it, placidly put a large hunk into her own mouth, and chewed it
until the red juice stained her lips as if she were suffering from a hemorrhage.

The dais on which she lounged was as large as a small room, and was raised about three feet
from the ground, it being covered with pillows and hand-woven mats of straw and bamboo. Around
this thronelike couch were grouped her slaves and attendants, all armed with barongs and krises
stuck into their wide sash belts, and attired in many-coloured garments that gave one the impression,
both from fit and odour, of being on terms of long and close acquaintance with their wearers.
The inevitable naked, brown babies staggered around the room, their little stomachs, in many
instances, being swelled frightfully from a diet of too much rice and fish.

When the Sultana wanted privacy a drapery of red and white stuff, hung from the ceiling, could
be let down, but otherwise she was constantly in the presence of her slaves and retainers,
having the alternative of being smothered to death in privacy or bored to death in plenty of
fresh air. We were told the Sultana was a power in the State and a diplomatist of no mean order,
but it was hard to believe this in the royal presence, unwashed and unlovely as it was. Still,
I remember seeing in a Philadelphia paper that some American living in Sulu had described the
Sultana as being "an agreeable, refined, and charming Oriental diplomat." Her personality was
quoted as most attractive, "uniting a rare combination of Oriental elegance and modern grace."
She would be, it was said, in bearing and appearance, a credit to an American drawing-room.
Heaven forbid! Unless the writer possibly meant that after due training she would grace the
drawing-room in cap and apron, wielding a duster in lieu of her inherited rod of empire.

On the day of our visit, Her Majesty was attired in garments of decided dinginess, soiled and
faded, with here and there an ill-made patch, or perhaps a fresh hole, like a gaping wound,
in the cloth. But it is said that on the grand occasions when she honours the post with her
presence, she is attired in a splendour before which the lilies of the field wilt with envy.
Rainbow effects predominate, and much gilt and silver embroidery, the ravishing impression
being further enhanced by a pair of white cotton mitts drawn over her bird-claw hands. On these
occasions of state the Sultana rides into town on the back of a slave, with another slave holding
a parasol over her august head, and accompanied by several outriders, or rather outwalkers,
attired in few clothes of many colours.

The Sultan, too, rides pickaback when he comes to town, and as it is considered a great privilege
for a Moslem to have kissed the Sultan's hand or foot, he is often gracious enough to sit astride
a slave's shoulders in some public place, the palms of his hands and the soles of his bare
feet obligingly outstretched, so that the thronging people can come by fours and do homage
to his state as expeditiously as possible.

One of the officers stationed in Sulu told us of a hunting trip which he and several other
men had taken with the Sultan and a high-ranking datto, a royal hunt through royal preserves.
To the intense amusement of the Americans, the Moros insisted on taking their respective harems
with them on the chase, and at night all slept in one large room, the three factions being
separated only by curtains around raised platforms.

For some time the harems and their respective lords called back and forth to each other quite
audibly, until the officers, worn out with their day's shooting, fell asleep. About midnight
the Americans were awakened by such frightful shrieks and blood-curdling yells that each instinctively
felt for his revolver or rifle, fearing an attack from the fanatical Moslems. It transpired,
however, that it was only a slave girl singing the Sultan to sleep! The officer described this
musical effort as a most hideous uproar, saying that a note would be held almost to the bursting
point, the breath being regained by an agonized, strangled sob, or else a bar would be yelled
explosively between hissing, indrawn breaths, the effect not conforming to the laws of harmony
as understood by Europeans.

On other hunting trips, when the Americans had been accompanied by Moro guides, great difficulty
was found in procuring food suited to Mohammedan restrictions, the Moros even refusing bread
because there might be lard in it, or because they had seen the soldier cooks grease the pans
with that abomination; sardines were also prohibited for fear they had been soaked in animal
fat; and bacon was of course accursed.

The officers were in despair until one old Moro came across some cans of baked beans among
the rations. Beans! Assuredly a clean vegetable, and as such to be partaken of freely. So there
they sat, good Moslems all, regaling themselves out of cans marked plainly on their gaudy labels,
"Pork and Beans." Moreover, they averred that the American article had an exceptionally fine
Bavour, not in the least like the Philippine variety!

So strong is the Moros' aversion to even touching pork, that while they will guide Americans
where boar may be found, they themselves will take no part in the sport nor help carry the
game home, and even when offered American prices a pound for the meat, that representing fabulous
wealth to a Moro, he will not defile himself by so much as selling it.

Mr. Dean C. Worcester, in his delightful book, "The Philippine Islands," gives a most interesting
legend in explanation of the Moros' aversion to pork. He says he made numerous attempts in
Mindanao, Basilan, and Sulu to find out the origin of this curious distaste, but without avail,
until one day the minister of justice, under "his Excellency Paduca Majasari Malauna Amiril
Mauinin Sultan Harun Narrasid," committed a bibulous indiscretion, and when the vivifying spirits
were well amalgamated with his own he contributed the following narrative:

"Jesus Christ, called by the Moros Isa, was a man like ourselves, but great, and good, and
very powerful. He was not a son of God. The Moros hate and kill the Christians because they
teach that men could punish and kill a son of God.

"Mohamoud had a grandson and a grand-daughter, of whom he was very fond. As he was king of
the world, Christ came to his house to visit him. Mohamoud, jealous of him, told him to prove
his power by 'divining' what he had in a certain room, where, in fact, were his grandchildren.
Christ replied that he had no wish to prove his power, and would not 'divine' (divinar). Mohamoud
then vowed that if he did not answer correctly, he should pay for it with his life. Christ
responded, 'You have two animals in there, different from anything else in the world.' Mohamoud
replied, 'No, you are wrong, and I will now kill you.' Christ said, 'Look first, and see for
yourself.' Mohamoud opened the door, and out rushed two hogs, into which Christ had changed
his grandchildren.

"Moros are forbidden to tell this story to infidels, because it shows that Christ outwitted
the great prophet. When my informant sobered up and realized what he had done, he hung around
day after day, beseeching me not to let any one know what he had done, from which fact I inferred
that he thought he had told me the truth, and not a fable invented for the occasion."

That first morning in Sulu, after having paid our respects to the Sultana, we called upon the
next greatest personage in town, a Hadji but lately returned from his pilgrimage to Mecca.
He was a most intelligent man, with regular features, fine eyes, and a flowing beard, impressively
patriarchal. He was a priest as well as a Hadji, and, we were told, had a mighty following
among the faithful. Both he and his wife were most hospitable in their manner and courteous
in their speech, she beaming toothlessly upon us throughout the call, and as we left they pressed
upon me a handful of rather rare shells as a memento of the visit.

The small boy of the family, a youngster of seven or eight, stared at us continually from the
moment of our entrance into the house until our exit, seeming especially taken with the young
officer; so much so, in fact, that on our leaving, he followed us to the door, and there climbed
upon a high seat, from which point of vantage he seized the young man's hand, kissed it very
reverently, and then laid it against his forehead. This was all done so solemnly and with such
a calm dignity that even the youngster's entire lack of raiment could not detract from its
impressiveness or the significance of the action. It was evident that he imagined the big,
blond lieutenant was a Serif, a direct descendant of Mohammed, or perhaps even a Habi, which
means a Serif who has been to Mecca, or a Hadji and Serif in one, than whom none but the Sultan
is so great, so good, so omnipotent. I dared not laugh at the child's earnestness, though I
had some trouble in controlling my risibles, the aforesaid young officer not having a reputation
for excessive holiness.

Long before reaching the Moro school for boys, which we next visited, we could hear the voices
of the pupils in a treble uproar, for they all and individually studied aloud, rocking back
and forth in their seats, so that at first the sound was an unintelligible jumble, which finally
resolved itself into bits of the multiplication table, detached letters of the alphabet, and
pages from geography or history.

As we entered the door, the scholars looked up expectantly from their work, glad of an interruption,
and at a sign from one of the Mohammedan teachers, they sprang to their feet with the uniformity
of a machine, fairly yelling their "Good morning" at us. Fine little lads they were, all being
of Moro, Chinese, or Filipino stock, with here and there a fascinating combination of the three
nationalities in one.

Of course the children were put through their paces for us, and, as each recited in turn, he
would preface his remarks by a profound bow and a little speech, the words of these formal
introductions being exactly alike, as if ground out by a phonograph, and beginning "Ladies
and Gentlemen," till I wondered if perhaps the children saw us double. They were not in the
least abashed, these little savages, and in their quaint English recited selections from Eugene
Field and James Whitcomb Riley, some of these efforts being in dialect, which must have been
a trifle puzzling to one not acquainted with the vagaries of the language.

Finally an arithmetical problem on the board caught my eye, and was surreptitiously transferred
to my note-book for future reference. It ran something like this: "A poor old lady owns one
thousand cents. She loses 189 of the cents. How many left has she?" The master, observing my
interest in the financial difficulties of the aged and destitute lady, had the little slates
brought up that I might see there were still 811 pennies to her credit. I inquired of some
of the boys how much 811 pennies put into dollars and cents would amount to, but all were so
visibly embarrassed that I, remembering my own mathematically tortured childhood, desisted
before the schoolmaster could hear. On leaving, the boys again jumped up as one, and shouted
their unanimous "Good-bye," and long after we were out of sight, we could hear their high young
voices studying aloud, each for himself, and apparently undisturbed by the scholastic outburst
of his neighbour.

Half a mile outside the walled garrison of Sulu, to the west, is a strong outpost built of
stone, and still farther out yet another. These outposts are always occupied by American soldiers,
not originally because of any expected trouble with the Moros, but because if our men did not
occupy them the Moros would, thus giving them an almost invincible stronghold against us in
case of some sudden fanatical uprising. Among the Moros, as in Granada, "Love laughs with a
grip on the knife," and preparedness is as essential as good government.

Near these outposts may be seen some very fine kitchen gardens, kept by the frugal Celestial,
the Chinaman of Sulu being much more energetic commercially than the Moro. It is from the "Chino"
the American housewife buys her fresh fruits and vegetables, while the Moros bring in fish
and the Filipinos chicken and game, thus ensuring a well-stocked larder independent of the
supply-ships from Manila. In fact, so delightful a place is Sulu, that if fever were not prevalent
there at some seasons of the year, it would be a veritable Paradise; but even the sanitary
measures taken by the great Spanish General Arolas have not quite stamped out that scourge
to white men, which long made Sulu the most undesirable military station in the islands.

Everybody in the Philippines knows the story of General Arolas, and of how, at the close of
a brief republican administration in Spain, he was practically banished to Sulu, there to die
by fever or be killed by the Moros. But Arolas, instead of settling down into an inactive life
awaiting what seemed the inevitable, occupied himself in building up the town, fortifying it
strongly, and at the same time making it more beautiful by laying it out in broad streets and
avenues, interspersed at regular intervals with flowering squares and plazas. By draining these
streets well, building water-works, and establishing a fine new market, he changed its reputation
as a fever hole and made Sulu one of the most desirable stations in the south. By his relentless
attitude he gained the respect and fear of the Moros, and only once during his administration
did a fanatical Juramentado gain access to the town.

But Arolas was probably less popular with the Mohammedans than was the American officer in
command at the time of our visit. Indeed, he had been legally adopted by the royal family,
the fierce old Sultana calling him "Brother," and the Sultan referring to him as "Papa," while
a greater proof of their affection may be found in this extract of a letter written to General
MacArthur on the Moros being told that they were soon to lose their first American governor.

" ... I hereby bring to your notice that I have heard that our father, Major Sweet, Governor
of Jolo, will be taken away from us. This is the reason of my writing to you, because you are
the parent of the Moro people, and it is known to us that you will always do your best for
us, as you have done hitherto. Therefore, I beg to you anyhow for the present not to remove
Major Sweet from here, as he has been very good to us, and he is very well known to everybody.
He is like a parent to us Moro people. It will be just like a child who is left by his parents;
he will fret and be longing for the one he loves; the Moro people are the same way. Even if
somebody else would come, it would not be the same, as he would be unknown; he will be another
man for that reason. To tell the truth, our father, Major Sweet, has opened our eyes; he has
been the man to show us the right way to come up to the white man's ideas, and there are many
cases where he has shown us his good-will. Therefore, I, the Sultan of the Jolo Archipelago,
am seeking that whatever is good for my people. It is my sincerest wish that my country should
go ahead.

"Since Major Sweet, our father, has been in command of Jolo Archipelago, no disturbance of
any description has occurred; the reason is, that he has taken great interest in our country
and its people. He was the man who saw our poverty, our incapability of paying customs duties,
as more than one calamity has befallen our islands; therefore, we thank him and we trust him,
although not knowing what he will do in the future, if it will change or not. Therefore, I
and my people ask you to consider the removal of Major Sweet, we ask you to leave him here;
we would like him to teach us the customs of the white people."

This, signed by the Sultan himself, is surely documentary evidence of successful American administration
with the Mohammedans, who were counted by the Spaniards as quite ungovernable.

Socially, we found Sulu delightful, and in our few days there had many pleasant dinners both
on and off the ship, a little dance at the club-house, and a tennis tea. The women all wore
pretty frocks, their houses were charming, and their servants as well trained as if they were
living anywhere but on a dot of an island in the Sulu Sea. All of which goes to show what American
women can do in all circumstances, especially army women. It was often hard to realize, while
in Sulu, that just outside the house which encompassed our little civilization, barbarism lurked,
but through the open windows one could see the Moros in their picturesque colours, the more
soberly dressed Filipinos, and the thrifty Chinamen, with their long queues twisted up under
their flat straw hats, while bits of conversation in all three tongues drifted in and mingled
with our talk, as foreign to the American ear as was the tropical foliage to the American eye.

Of course we bought all sorts of curios before sailing, embroidered turbans, sarongs, jabuls,
handsome krises, chow-covers of beautifully coloured straw, and hats of every variety, while
one day, as an experiment in shopping, I bargained for a Moro slave, a handsome, black-eyed
boy, but as he could not be purchased for less than ten dollars gold, I informed his owner
that he was too expensive. This transaction was carried on with great seriousness by the elderly
Mohammedan, while the youngster himself showed great interest in the proceedings, and looked
a little disappointed when he found he was not to belong to the Americana after all.

Slave-raiding has of course been forbidden since American occupation, but the authorities have
not yet been able to entirely do away with slave-trading, polygamy, nor other like peccadilloes,
religious toleration being the password to the ultimate civilization of our new citizens.

Meanwhile the Signal Corps had entrenched the cable, and connected it by a short land line
with the telegraph office, which was established in short order, everything being in perfect
condition for the return trip to Zamboanga by the afternoon of the 28th. At daybreak on the
following morning, we sailed for Zamboanga, only to find orders awaiting us there to proceed
at once on a wrecking expedition to Bongao, on Bongao Island of the Tawi Tawi group, a small
launch, the Maud, being foundered there on a coral reef. Thus were we hoist by our own petard,
for over the cable just laid came the order postponing our return to Manila; but as it meant
yet another chapter in a delightful experience, few of us were averse to that.

So, between nine and ten o'clock that night, we sailed for Tawi Tawi, passing east of Basilan
and Sulu. The ship, relieved of nearly all its cable, rolled a great deal, both on our way
up from Sulu and that first night out from Zamboanga, but on the two succeeding days the weather
was calm, the air cool, and the "Sultan's Sea" a gigantic mirror reflecting every cloud in
the sky on its glassy surface. All on board were idle then, and every steamer chair on the
quarter-deck was occupied.

On the first day out we saw no land at all, but the second day many coral groups appeared to
the east and south of Bongao. Among others were Manuk Manuk, surely a name to conjure with!
Then there was also Balambing, which on our ship chart was marked PIRATES! Think of sailing
piratical seas in this prosaic twentieth century! We watched eagerly along the coast of Balambing,
to which we passed very close, for possible crafts bearing black flags, and were rather disappointed
at not seeing even one bearded highwayman of the sea, a gleaming knife between his teeth, his
red shirt open at the throat, for, if I remember rightly, it was so that pirates were always
drawn in the yellow-covered interdicted literature of childhood.

These southern waters were bluer than any we had seen on the trip, excepting over coral reefs,
where the blue changed suddenly to a glittering iridescent green, sparkling and treacherous.
This coral is eminently American in its habit of expansion, and has spread itself well over
the southwest portion of the Celebes Sea.

Finally Tawi Tawi itself appeared on the horizon, and we recalled that deep in its heart, surrounded
by vast forests and jungles, the faintly discernible ruins of Dungon exist, the ruins themselves
covered by tremendous growths of trees. This was the ancient capital of the Moros, and there
lie the remains of the first Arab Sultan, that fierce old missionary who brought the Koran
in one hand and a kris in the other to spread the light of Islam. That his converts were many
and their faith was strong and sure is attested by the universality of Mohammedanism in these
southern islands, and the exclusive use of the Arabic characters in the writing of the people.

On the afternoon of March 3d, we anchored off Bongao. On our port side, and well forward, lay
the wrecked Maud nearly filled with water. Altogether she was in a deplorable condition, but
in a few days was raised by the combined efforts of our first officer, his crew, and the soldiers
of the fort. Meanwhile, we were all idlers on the Burnside, and in consequence enjoyed our
visit there to the utmost.

Chapter IX

BONGAO

Despite the fact of its remoteness from civilization, or perhaps because of it, we found Bongao
most attractive. Situated on a dot of an island belonging to the Tawi Tawi group, it is the
southernmost part of our new possessions to be garrisoned. West of it Borneo looms up on the
horizon, and to the south is Sibutu, for which Spain was paid a good round sum because certain
gentlemen on the Paris Commission lacked geographic accuracy; while to the east and north are
coral islands belonging to the same group as Bongao. The garrison is situated on a mountainous
spur of land running down steeply to the water. It is laid out like a park, the soldiers' quarters,
hospital, library, and storehouses being of bamboo and nipa, over which the men have trained
vines and creeping plants, while before each door bloom beds of bright flowers.

The officers' quarters are built higher up on a wind-swept slope overlooking the bay, where
it curves around the point of the island, and while these houses are picturesque from the outside,
they are roughly finished within, the "banquet-hall," as they dignified the mess, being especially
al fresco. Over the extemporized sideboard, consisting of some rude shelves, on which were
piled a heterogeneous collection of tinned fruits and vegetables, hung a motto which read "God
Bless our Home. If you don't like it, get out!" On the reverse side of this somewhat suggestive
placard was the pleasing gastronomic intelligence, "Chicken to-day," chicken forming the staple
of diet at Bongao, as of course fresh meat is to be had only at the rarest intervals.

For six months at a stretch the monsoon blows across the coral peninsula in one direction,
and then changes and blows six months in the opposite quarter, so that, as an officer stationed
there remarked, one could take his choice and be blown off to the crocodiles in the bay or
to the sharks in the sea outside. This high wind moderates the climate perceptibly, however,
and notwithstanding the fact that Bongao is situated within five degrees of the equator, we
found it exceptionally cool, and the officers and men in splendid physical condition.

There was but one company of infantry stationed at Bongao when we were there, comprising perhaps
fifty men and three officers. Because of the two hundred miles of treacherous ocean between
him and higher authority, the young captain acting as military governor was, so to speak, a
small Czar, and he ruled an unique kingdom, untouched by civilization, and peopled entirely
by ex-pirates or the descendants of pirates.

The official letter-book of this functionary, at which he allowed us to peep, read like a story
of adventure, while some of his own personal experiences, and those of the former commanding
officer, seem almost incredible when away from the glamour of the place. In the post records,
sandwiched between such mundane things as requisitions for water-buckets or commissary supplies,
one would read of atrocious murders committed by the Moros; piratical expeditions headed off,
and their instigators punished; or attempted slave-raids against some neighbouring island.

Under the date of February 21, 1900, a thrilling story was told, it being the official and
unvarnished account of a disastrous hunting trip taken by five of the post soldiers, the dispassionate
routine language but giving it verisimilitude; while the subsequent happenings serve to show
what kind of government seems most to appeal to these people.

The story, as nearly as I can remember it, reads that five of the garrison soldiers were given
permission to go to a neighbouring island of the Tawi Tawi group on a hunting expedition after
wild boar. Relations with the Moros on that island having been, at least, nominally friendly,
there was not the slightest hesitation in granting the soldiers' request, particularly as there
had been no fresh meat in the garrison for some time.

The men left in a rowboat and spent the first few hours in Balambing, an ex-pirate community,
where they were entertained in the best Moro fashion, leaving amidst mutual expressions of
regret and good-will. The Moros' love for firearms is well known, and about ten of them were
so taken with the soldiers' rifles that they accompanied the party, ostensibly to act as guides,
but in reality to witness the sport. Delayed by a strong tide running to windward, they camped
that night on a lonely beach, both Americans and Moros in the best possible humour.

After a supper cooked over the camp-fire, all the soldiers, with the exception of one man who
was preparing for bed, indulged in a game of cards, the Moros watching the proceeding with
apparent interest, but talking a great deal among themselves. Each soldier had his Krag on
the ground beside him in case of danger, the rifle of the man who was undressing being in a
far corner of the room.

Suddenly, at a word from their leader, the Moros seized their wicked barongs and simultaneously
attacked the men playing cards, beheading one poor fellow at a single blow, and fearfully cutting
the three others. One died almost immediately, and the second fell unconscious, while the third,
who was cut across the side of the head and neck, feigned death and so escaped with his life.

The soldier who was partly undressed, seeing that he could not reach his rifle, felt it was
only a matter of seconds before his turn should come. But the Moros, having obtained all the
firearms, escaped into the forest, leaving him unharmed. As hastily as possible, he lifted
the still unconscious man into the boat, which had been hidden in the bushes against just such
an emergency, the wounded soldier who had feigned death helping with all his little strength,
though he was so grievously hurt that he had literally to hold on his head with his hands,
the cords on one side of his neck being severed. Fortunately, the jugular vein escaped the
keen knife's edge, else he would not have been alive; but it was with no little difficulty
he helped the unwounded man push off from shore.

All night they rowed, the wounded man working with one hand, despite his fearful suffering,
and all the next day, the blazing tropic sun shining down on their unprotected heads. Once
they were beached on a coral reef, and it was all they could do to get the boat off again into
deep water. Meanwhile the third soldier died, but at last the survivors of the massacre, in
a pitiable condition, reached the post, carrying between them the already putrefying corpse
of their comrade.

Scarce waiting to hear their gruesome story, the commanding officer and most of his company
put off in bancas for Balambing, the unwounded man accompanying them for the purpose of identification.
Arriving late in the afternoon, the soldiers quickly surrounded the town before any Moro could
escape in his prau, and the rapidity with which the Philippine Mohammedan can drop from his
house, built on poles over the water, and paddle away is little less than miraculous.

The head men of the village were then summoned by the American captain and ordered to hand
over the murderers and the stolen rifles, or lead the way to the hiding-place of the criminals
before eight o'clock of the following morning, the penalty for their disobedience being the
burning of the town.

That night numerous lights and the sound of voices in the village testified to the earnest
discussion that was proceeding, and at daybreak six of the offenders were delivered into American
hands, the survivor of the outrage testifying to their identity; but the captain was not satisfied
and consulted his watch so impatiently as eight o'clock approached that the head men, after
much consultation among themselves, finally led the way to where the others were concealed
along with the captured rifles.

Here the ten prisoners were rounded up and preparations made for the return to Bongao, when
suddenly a simultaneous break for liberty was attempted, and the Moros had a lesson in the
deadly aim of the American soldier, for a fearful fusilade was opened on them at short range,
and not a prisoner escaped.

To one unacquainted with the Moros, this swift and sure vengeance would seem sufficient to
cause the relatives of the dead men to hate Americans and plan blood feuds in retaliation;
but it was not so, for they recognized perfectly the wrong that had been done, and accepted
the death of their kinsmen as well merited, while any regret they may have felt was at the
unlucky turn of fate which put them into the hands of justice. Being captured, it was inconceivable
to a Moro that the offenders should be spared, and the break for liberty was doubtless induced
by the belief that at the worst they merely advanced the day of execution. For had they not
killed, and what is quite as bad in the Moro code of ethics, stolen? No punishment following
this outrage, the Moros would have looked on the Americans as white-livered, cowardly, pusillanimous,
and that first crime would doubtless have been succeeded by raids on the town, and massacres,
and feuds, which only a bloody war could have ended.

As a result of his prompt action, this very efficient young officer had the satisfaction of
knowing that the cordial relations with the citizens of Balambing rested on a new and more
secure foundation than ever before. That no ill-will is harboured against the Americans may
be seen by the large crowd of Balambing natives who weekly market their wares at Bongao, and
the invariable respect shown by them to the uniform. Americans go freely without arms all over
the island. In truth, it is asserted by different head men that the first attack would never
have been made on the soldiery had it not been for the rifles they carried. Human life is cheap
among the Moros, and the inconvenience of that life standing between them and what they want
is soon remedied by a barong, unless fear of punishment, prompt and pitiless, stares them in
the face.

From Balambing of bloody memory comes a Moro love story of some interest and no little humour.
It appears that a rich woman there fell in love with a handsome young slave belonging to a
man in a neighbouring town. After some difficulty she effected his purchase and married him,
despite the fact of his being so far beneath her in the social scale. Not long after this the
happy couple went to Bongao on a market-day. The lady, being an inveterate gambler, repaired
at once to the cockpit, where she lost so heavily that her remaining funds were inadequate
for the return trip to Balambing. Then a happy idea struck her. Why not pawn her husband, awaiting
her next visit to Bongao, for although she was married to him, he was still a slave in the
eyes of the law, and she could redeem him at her pleasure.

Acting on this happy inspiration, she sought an audience with the Governor, explaining through
the interpreter her predicament, and offering her husband as a security for the loan of two
hundred and fifty dollars, gold. The Governor, being a bachelor, was skeptical as to this marital
transaction, especially as the couple had been wedded beyond the traditional honeymoon. He
was afraid that he might have the bridegroom permanently upon his hands did he advance so great
a sum. This was made plain to the bride, who protested that life would be quite unendurable
without her liege lord, or more properly speaking, in this case, liege subject; but the Governor
was unrelenting.

How the lady finally managed to reach Balambing is not told. Perhaps some trusting Moro accepted
the risk of the marital loan. Perhaps she induced the owner of a prau to row her across. However
the distance was accomplished, it is to be hoped she was less reckless in her subsequent gambling,
a husband having proved so bad a hostage.

Another love story of different import comes from a village on the island of Siminor, just
south of Bongao. There, it is said, lives an old Moro who so loved his wife, and strange to
say, in this polygamous community, his only wife, that when she died he watched her grave long
beyond the appointed time, after which he had his house built over her burial-place, and there
lives to this day, still faithful to the mouldering bones beneath him. Surely a proof that
great love sometimes stirs even savage breasts. Considering the environment, for this man lives
in a country where polygamy is not only recognized but encouraged, and where women are bought
and sold by the pound, like so much meat, his love is on a par with the idyllic attachments
of history and fiction.

Speaking of buying and selling women among the Moros, reminds me of an old Maharajah in Bongao
who had never seen an American woman until the arrival of the Burnside. Of course all white
women are considered very beautiful by these dusky savages, an evidence of how much they admire
Europeans being found in the fact that they firmly believe in the Sultan's Seventh Heaven all
the wives of his harem will have white skins. Noticing the Maharajah's absorbed interest in
our appearance, the Governor, to our intense disgust, insisted upon asking the old fellow what
he thought the quartermaster's wife should be worth in dollars and cents. The toothless Maharajah
took it all quite seriously, looked at the lady in question with much discrimination, pulled
at his wisp of a billy-goat beard in contemplative silence, and after some minutes of deep
thought replied that she should be worth about a hundred dollars, Mexican, an abnormally large
amount, as Moro women seldom average over forty dollars, Mexican, apiece.

Then the irrepressible young man turned to me, asking at what the Maharajah thought I should
be valued. Without a moment's hesitation, the old sinner, to my chagrin and the uproarious
delight of the whole party, appraised me at only eighty dollars, Mexican, and this despite
the fact that I had smiled my pleasantest, in the hope that he would rate me at least as high
as the quartermaster's wife.

Datto Sakilon, whom we met next day, proved more diplomatic, for when asked what he thought
we women should be worth in the Mohammedan market, replied that it was impossible to tell,
because if Moro women could be bought for forty dollars apiece, an American woman should be
worth at least a thousand. Not bad repartee for a barbarian! In return for his consideration,
I must admit that he was the best dressed Moro we saw in Bongao. On the day in question he
wore a suit of gray drill, made with the conventional tight trousers and vest-like coat, broken
out at regular intervals in an eruptive fever of gorgeously coloured embroidery. A fez topped
off this costume and added to its picturesqueness, while clumsy tan shoes of undeniable American
make well-nigh ruined the whole effect.

Balbriggan undershirts, hideously utilitarian, are much worn by these Moros of Bongao in lieu
of the skin-tight gaily coloured jacket, which combines so effectively with the snug trousers
buttoned up the side with gold or silver buttons, and the bright turban or scarlet fez. But
fancy the shock to one's æstheticism at seeing coarse balbriggan allied to barbaric splendour.
The Moros really looked more undressed so attired than if they had appeared without any coat
at all, but they thought these shirts very elegant, and would buy them of the soldiers at every
opportunity.

The women's dress in Bongao, unlike that of northern Moros, is more typical than the men's,
and shows an even greater variety of colour, but because of their blackened teeth, which are
often filed to an arch in front, these women, as a rule, are anything but pretty. Their hair
is nearly always fringed over the forehead and temples, while at the back it is drawn into
a knot, from which one end invariably straggles, giving a most untidy effect. The wealthier
women wear their finger nails very long, in some instances almost as long as the finger itself,
and often this nail is protected by an artificial shield of silver. All the women have their
ears pierced, and many of them wear a round bone or stick, resembling a cigarette in shape
and size, thrust through the aperture. Altogether they are as unlike European women as one
could well imagine, and I do not blame the Sultan for looking forward to white wives in the
hereafter, though I hope the celestial harem won't have to blacken its teeth!

There was one beauty in Bongao, however, a slave girl of eighteen, so graceful and lithe that
her every attitude suggested a bird just alighted for an instant from a flight through space.
Her dark eyes were fringed by the longest of black lashes, and even her stained teeth could
not detract from the curves of her pretty mouth. She had a self-satisfied consciousness of
her own attractions, and was as imperious and overbearing as any American beauty, stamping
her tiny foot in rage at our photographer's lack of haste in taking her picture, and once walking
away from the camera with a disdainful toss of her head. When, after much persuasion, she was
finally induced to return, it was only to scowl sullenly at everybody with the most bewitching
ill temper, poised so lightly that the very wind seemed to sway her slender figure back and
forth like a flower on its stalk.

We called her the Belle of Bongao, and said all manner of nice things about her, which she
repaid with a bold stare from under those wonderful lashes, and a contemptuous manner which
said as plainly as words that American women were not much to look at, what with their ugly
clothes and still uglier faces. She was glad she wasn't so large and clumsy, and that her teeth
weren't white, nor her throat all screwed up in high bandages, and she smiled a little as she
thought of her own attractions, for the Belle of Bongao had not learned she was a beauty for
nought; and then, too, had she not cost eighty dollars, Mexican, the highest price ever paid
in Tawi Tawi for a slave? Small wonder the little beauty rated her charms high.

It was in Bongao we first made the acquaintance of Toolawee, the chief vigilante of Sulu. It
seems this personage had been sent to the Tawi Tawi Islands as pilot of the launch Maud, which,
under his careful seamanship, was then lying high and dry on a coral reef within sight of the
little garrison. Pirate under Spanish régime, chief of police under American administration,
Toolawee is known to fame throughout the archipelago, though perhaps most of his reputation
depends upon Mr. Worcester's delightful account of him in "The Philippine Islands." As all
may remember, Toolawee acted in the capacity of guide, philosopher, and friend to Mr. Worcester
and Doctor Bourns on their second visit to Sulu, many moons before our occupation of the place.
Toolawee was at that time acting as "minister of war" to the nominal Sultan, having for reasons
of his own become a renegade. Mr. Worcester says of him:

"A Moro by birth and training, he had thrown in his lot with the Spaniards. As a slight safeguard
against possible backsliding, he was allowed a fine house within the walls, where he kept several
wives and some forty slaves. Arolas reasoned that, rather than lose so extensive an establishment,
he would behave himself. Later we had reason for believing that the precaution was a wise one....

"He was considered a 'good' Moro, and we were therefore interested in several incidents which
gave us some insight into his real character. After satisfying himself that we could use our
rifles with effect, he made us a rather startling business proposition as follows: 'You gentlemen
seem to shoot quite well with the rifle.' 'Yes, we have had some experience.' 'You say that
you wish to get samples of the clothing and arms of my people for your collection?' 'Yes, we
hope to do so.' 'Papa' (the Moros' name for their governor-general) 'told you if you met armed
Moros outside the town to order them to lay down their weapons and retire?' 'Yes.' 'Papa does
not understand my people as I do. They are all bad. When we meet them, do not ask them to lay
down their arms, for they will come back and get them, and probably attack us; just shoot as
many of them as you can. You can take their weapons and clothing, while I will cut off their
heads, shave their eyebrows, show them to papa, and claim reward for killing Juramentados.'
Toolawee never really forgave us for refusing to enter into partnership with him on this very
liberal basis.

"Just before our final departure from Sulu, he presented himself before me and remarked, 'Señor,
I want to buy your rifle.' 'But, Toolawee,' I replied, 'you do damage enough with the one you
have; what do you want of mine?' 'My rifle is good enough to kill people with, but I want yours
for another purpose,' my good Moro made answer. Pressed for details, he confided to me that
he had heard 'papa' was soon going back to Spain, and, after the governor left, he should be
'afuera' i.e. offshore, waiting for victims. He explained that he never fired at the people
in a canoe, but shot holes in the boat itself, so that it would fill with water. The bamboo
outriggers, with which all Philippine boats are provided, would serve to keep it from actually
sinking, and the occupants, being up to their chins in water, could easily be despatched with
the barong, thus economizing ammunition; and he added, 'My rifle makes but a small hole in
one side of a canoe, senor, while yours would make a much larger one, and the ball would go
clear through.' Toolawee was nothing if not practical."

While in Bongao, a Moro dance was given in our honour at the house of the governor's interpreter,
a German, who at the time was away on a business trip. His wife, a plump and jolly matron of
Moro descent, did the honours, and smiled her good-natured, indiscriminating smile on one and
all, shaking each cordially by the hand and indicating where we should sit by many motions
of her fat, brown wrists and many shrugs of her still fatter shoulders. Unlike other Moro women,
our hostess's hair was neatly arranged, her teeth were beautifully white, and her costume,
which consisted of a nondescript skirt and loose dressing sacque, much affected by Spanish
women throughout the islands, was daintily clean.

The other occupants of the big room were Moro--unadulterated Moro--fifty or sixty of them,
all in gala dress, the women squatted on the floor, the men leaning against the side of the
house, and all staring with unabashed interest in our direction, while we stared back at them
quite as interested.

Every man there was armed with at least a barong stuck into his broad sash, and many of them
boasted a kris and campilan as well, while the brilliant colours of their costumes, and the
still more gaudy sarongs of the women, made them resemble a gathering of strange tropic birds,
our European apparel looking singularly dull and sober beside their scarlets, greens, and purples.
Over this strange scene flickered the dim light of cocoanut-oil lamps, and outside a shower
beat softly against the trees, and the moon looked down at us whitely from a cloudy sky.

Presently a weird noise broke in upon our conversation. The orchestra had begun to play. Now,
Moro music is strangely unrhythmical to European ears, consisting as it does of a monotonous
reiteration of sound, even a supposed change of air being almost imperceptible to one unaccustomed
to the barbarous lack of tone. The Moro piano is a wooden frame, shaped like the runners of
a child's sled, on which are balanced small kettle-drums by means of cords and sticks. These
more nearly resemble pots for the kitchen range than musical instruments, but each is roughly
tuned, forming the eight notes of the scale. Women, crouching on the ground before this instrument,
beat out of it a wailing sound with shaped sticks, while on larger kettle-drums, hung by ropes
from a wooden railing at one side, two men accompanied the "piano," an old woman in the background
drumming out an independent air of her own on an empty tin pan.

Meanwhile the dancing had begun, or rather the posturing of the body, for the feet and legs
are used but little in the Moro dances, which consist principally of moving the body and arms
rhythmically and to music, the wrists always leading gracefully.

Among the women this attitudinizing was very pretty, the bangles tinkling on their round arms,
while the sarong half-revealed, half-concealed the curves of their figures. Most of them danced
with their heads turned away, but whenever the evolutions of their measured step brought them
face to face with us, they would hold up the sarong so that it concealed all but the eyes,
evidently a survival of the yashmak, for Moro women do not hide their faces at all times from
the gaze of men, as do the women of India.

When the men danced it was far less graceful, and at times bordered on the grotesque. They
contorted and twisted themselves out of all semblance to the human body; they made their abdominal
muscles rise and fall with the music; they seemed at times to put the body out of joint, and
then reset it properly with jerks and jumps and sudden fierce movements; they twitched, and
twisted, and twirled, hardly moving their feet from the floor.

Then came sword-dances with naked blades, when some young Moro advanced and retreated, leaped
high in the air, or crouched on the ground, waving his barong or kris aloft, now retreating,
now coming uncomfortably close to the little party of unarmed Americans, the flickering light
gleaming redly on the glittering knife, and reminding one, with a horrid insistence, that the
time and place were ideal for a wholesale slaughter.

As the necessities of the dance took the last of these lithe youths farther away, I must confess
to a feeling of relief, which mounted to a nervous joy when, after apparently slaying his enemy
and grinding him under heel, the dancing combatant gave place to a chubby youngster who stamped,
and twirled, and gestured himself into our very hearts. This baby, for he could not have been
over four years old, was also a prime favourite with the Moros, who yelled out their delight
at his prowess, and even clapped their hands and jumped about in their enthusiasm. But the
baby was stoically calm, and moved not a muscle of his little round face in response to their
greetings.

Then came the old Maharajah, who had set his price on the American women. Wrinkled, white-haired,
and toothless, he danced amidst great applause; and after him a tiny girl posed most picturesquely,
throwing out her plump, dimpled wrists, on which twinkled innumerable bangles. Waving each
wrist in turn, the little maid would fasten upon it a serious gaze, as if she were a snake-charmer
and each arm was a serpent, her hand representing the head, which waved ever back and forth
restlessly and in time to the strange music.

Before leaving, a mock marriage was performed for our benefit by the one-eyed Pandita. As is
the custom at such times, all the Moro women, including the bride, who is never present at
her own wedding, were hidden behind an extemporized curtain. On the ground before this curtain
sat the Pandita and the prospective bridegroom, the bare soles of their feet touching and their
hands closely clasped beneath an enshrouding cloth. The Pandita then chanted or intoned a service,
the bridegroom occasionally joining in, and not infrequently some outsider introduced a facetious
expression or joke, which was greeted with uproarious delight by the others, the Moro sense
of humour being apparently well developed.

Of course, the mock marriage ended here, but we were told that at this point of the service
in a real wedding the groom would go behind the curtain and seize his bride, who was supposed
to struggle violently to escape. She would then be carried to the groom's house, and for three
days the feasting and merry making would continue--for everyone but the happy pair, as according
to custom, the bride must quarrel violently during this time with the groom, and not allow
him to come near her, though when he finally leaves her alone, she must bitterly weep and lament.
At the expiration of the three days, this charming state of affairs is discontinued, and they
are considered legally married, and thereafter may be as happy as they are capable of being.

On leaving the interpreter's house to walk back to the ship's boat, we were lighted by a misty
moon which gave the effect of twilight, and in our half lethargic state could hardly be sure
that what we had seen that evening was not, after all, a dream or a strange hypnotic memory--the
dancing Maharajah, the Pandita performing the marriage ceremony, the terrible sword-dance,
and the little snake-charmer fascinating her own plump hands! Was it possible such things had
occurred in the twentieth century and on American soil?

Chapter X

TAMPAKAN AND THE HOME STRETCH

Our last day in Bongao the Governor secured a little pearling launch, the Hilda, and took several
of the Burnside people on a jaunt to the island of Siminor, as it is written on the map, or
Siminol, as it is called by the natives. Siminol is about ten miles south of Bongao, and our
destination was the town of Tampakan. It was a misty, moisty afternoon, with a sharp salt smell
to the air, and through the haze distant mountains loomed spectre-like, or else melted into
blue clouds on the horizon.

After a two hours' run, during which the Hilda wheezed and puffed like a fat old woman in a
tight frock, we reached Tampakan, and anchored as near the shore as was practicable, blowing
our whistle to attract the attention of the villagers. In a few moments several praus and bancas
were poled out to the ship by a motley array of half-clad Moros, big, brown, lithe fellows,
each with a turban or fez topping off his black hair, and all armed with a goodly array of
sharp knives. Over the side of the launch they swarmed, talking excitedly with our interpreter,
the chief vigilante of Bongao, and reminding one strongly of their piratical forebears. Many
of these very men had been pirates in Spanish days, and not one of them but was a descendant
of some marauder of the high seas.

The three hundred yards that we had to be poled to shore from the Hilda was through water not
more than three feet deep, and over a bed of pink and white coral, which could be plainly seen
through the crystal clearness. At low tide one can walk out over this submarine beach, but
the Moros say that the rocks, seaweed, and coral lose much of their beauty when not seen through
a lens of water. At the time of our visit it was such high tide that even with the native praus
and the little rowboat from the launch, we were unable to make a good landing, so the men jumped
ashore in imminent danger of a wetting, while we women were carried, one by one, through the surf.

A villainous looking gentleman, whose costume consisted of skin-tight Moro trousers and an
American bath towel, was introduced by our host as the head man of the town, and he shook hands
all around, quite solemnly and conscientiously, as if it had been a religious rite imported
to Tawi Tawi by these strange white people.

Meanwhile the entire male population of the place gathered about us, and we found them in very
truth a murderous looking lot, armed to the teeth with barongs and krises and campilans, while
none of us had any visible means of self-protection. There were a few pocket revolvers, however,
hidden under the officers' blouses, and well hidden, the Governor having warned us to take
no arms of any description to Tampakan, for while money would have been no temptation to these
people, they would not have hesitated long to kill one for a Krag rifle or a Colt revolver.

After the head man had religiously shaken every newcomer's hand, our officers began bargaining
with him and with his people for their knives, and the crowd of men around us grew every moment
greater, with not a woman in sight. There were men in complete Moro costume, handsome and picturesque;
others ruining their appearance by the addition of a hideous balbriggan undershirt, sandwiched
between tight trousers with innumerable buttons and a brilliantly coloured turban; while still
others, in little else than a fez and breech-clout, seemed not a whit abashed. The children
were either quite naked, or wrapped in sarongs, faded by the sun and weather to a dull harmony
of their once too brilliant reds and greens.

Finally on the outskirts of the crowd I caught a glimpse of three Moro women, and forced my
way to them, shaking hands and smiling as affably as possible. They shook hands in return,
rather awkwardly, but answered smile with smile, talking excitedly in their native tongue,
and seeming surprised that I could speak only a word or two of Malay, without doubt a more
agreeable language than that harsh and unintelligible one in which the white officers were
bargaining for barongs and krises.

Over the stone fortification a short distance away I had a glimpse of tree tops and the steep,
slanting roofs of nipa houses, while at the gate stood still another group of women, most of
them dressed from the waist to the knees only. Motioning my three friends to follow, I approached
these women, whereupon they took fright and hid behind the nearest house. That is, all but
one old crone, too feeble to run, who tremblingly awaited her fate until, reassured by the
manner of those I had talked to outside the wall, she lifted up her voice in voluble Malay,
evidently telling the others that the strange creature neither bit nor scratched, whereat they
all came back, first slowly by ones and twos, and then more rapidly, until they stood around
me in a ring at least twenty deep.

As women have a language of their own the world over, we understood each other quickly; and
how friendly they were, and how delighted with my clothes and all the little accessories, the
hat, the veil, the belt, the collar. Next they were amazed at my teeth, and pointed to their
own blackened ones, and then to mine, pushing forward little girls under ten to show that only
children should have white teeth, while I, despite my extreme age, still sported such evidences
of youth. Was it possible I considered myself a child? Or was I younger than I looked? Next
my skin was marvelled at, and they took my hands in theirs and shouted with good-natured laughter
at the difference in colour between us, for despite two and a half years of tropic tan, my
skin, compared with theirs, was very light.

Before I realized what they were doing, they had unbuttoned the cuff of my shirt-waist and
pushed the sleeve a little way up my arm, evidently anxious to see if I were white all over,
while at the same moment a small girl of twelve, married or of marriageable age, as one could
tell from her stained teeth, knelt down on the ground at my feet and was apparently examining
my shoes.

Suddenly she gave a startled cry, and before I could prevent her, lifted my skirt and petticoat
to the ankle, revealing a small expanse of black lisle thread stocking. For a moment there
was an intense silence, followed by a low murmur of astonishment, which soon grew into a veritable
roar of displeasure, and the women no longer beamed approvingly, but gathered together on one
side, regarding me with great disfavour.

I was dumfounded at this sudden change of manner, and could not account for it in any way,
until I saw some of the blackest among them pointing to their own bare legs with apparent pride,
and then turning scornfully and motioning in my direction. Did they object to my wearing stockings?
Or was it possible they had mistaken the stockings for skin?

Acting on this very improbable suggestion, I demonstrated that the black outside covering could
easily be peeled off, whereupon there was great amazement, and once again the women crowded
around in deifying adulation. They had thought their American idol had worse than clay feet,
that the feet were black, blacker even than their own dusky skins, and their relief was obvious
at finding the dark flesh but a close fitting covering.

So it was I was again restored to favour, and the women with swift, shy gestures fingered my
dress and hat, my army belt, and the red silk handkerchief at the throat of my sailor collar,
saying, "Mariloa, mariloa" over and over, which in their tongue means "pretty" or "good," depending
on how it is used.

They laughed at my shoes, spreading out their flexible toes that I might see how much more
comfortable feet were unshod, and then pointed to their hands, indicating that it were quite
as sensible to wear shoes there as on the feet, which made me sorry some of us had not worn
gloves. Also I was much amused to notice that after biting even so lightly of the fruit of
knowledge, most of the women about me had drawn up the folds of the sarongs, tied so artlessly
around their waists, and fastened them securely under the armpits, so that they were clothed
quite decorously from shoulder to knee.

There was one beautiful little girl among the many plain ones in Tampakan. She could not have
been over ten years old, and her heavy eyebrows were shaved into a narrow black line above
magnificent eyes, shaded by phenomenally long lashes. Her features were regular and finely
cut, her mouth being particularly pretty, and when she smiled, which was seldom, her red lips
disclosed even little teeth, glistening and white. Her very hair, fringed heavily above her
brow, was soft and fine and hung almost to her knees in a dusky, rippling cloud, while both
tiny ears were pierced, the left one boasting an ivory stick about the size and shape of a
cigarette, and the other a roll of red rags, which barbaric custom served only to enhance her
wildwood tropic beauty.

The child's ena, or mother, was evidently very proud of her daughter, and through the interpreter,
told me that within a year the little maid was to marry a datto in a neighbouring town. A very
great honour, to be sure, and then her pretty, gleaming teeth will be blackened and filed into
an arch, her eyebrows shaved off completely, and at twenty-five the little beauty will doubtless
have been transformed into a wrinkled, loathsome old hag, and perhaps a grandmother to boot!

At the windows of a house under which we stood, women, who for some reason did not mingle with
the others of the village, peered down at us curiously, some holding up their sarongs to cover
all but the eyes, and some frankly interested, with uncovered faces; while still other creatures,
of nightmare ugliness, their skins plastered with a white flour paste, their eyebrows shaved,
and their teeth newly blackened and filed into shape, incurred the displeasure of their respective
lords and masters by appearing at the window even for a few moments at a time, it not being
Moro etiquette that these recent brides of the neighbourhood should be seen until a later period.

About this time Half-a-Woman and her mother appeared on the scene, the American child, with
her golden hair and white skin, enthusing the Moro women to the utmost, while the tall slenderness
of the mother excited their voluble admiration. But neither mother nor daughter appreciated
natives, except as accessories to the landscape, so they delayed not on the order of their
going, and audibly marvelled that I could be interested in such filthy wretches, insinuating
that a carbolic bath would be necessary on our return to the ship. But the Moro women, unconscious
of any criticism as to their personal neatness, smiled at the Americanas delightedly, telling
me through the interpreter that it would take two or three Moro women to make one as tall as
the quartermaster's wife, who looked very young indeed to have attained so great a height!

When the officers had completed their purchases, they started through the village on a tour
of inspection, and at their approach my women friends beat a hasty retreat, scattering in every
direction like so many quail; but as we proceeded along the one street of the town, accompanied
by a veritable army of native boys and men, I saw at the windows of different houses many familiar
faces, all grinning cheerfully in response to my nods of recognition.

The houses of Tampakan are built on one side of this broad street, and are small nipa shacks
on stilts, with steps of bamboo logs, and steep thatched roofs, while back of this first row
of houses stands another row, and back of that still another. At the far end of the street
two or three houses are built at right angles to the rest, and it was here that beautifully
woven petates, or sleeping mats, were offered for sale, some of them white with appliques of
red and blue cloth in curious designs, and others of split bamboo, the patterns being woven
in with different colours.

These mats were most reasonable in price, none of them costing over a dollar and a half, and
some very pretty ones were valued at only fifty cents apiece, but for sanitary reasons we were
obliged to forswear them, unique as they were, for they had all been in use, and we had seen
more than one leper among the villagers, and numerous evidences in scars and sores of loathsome
skin diseases.

Embroidered turbans, jabuls, and sarongs were also offered for sale, as were chow-covers and
tall pointed hats, while one man with great pride produced for our inspection a pressed glass
sugar bowl, that variety which one does not have to examine or tap with the finger to prove
counterfeit. It was pressed glass with no intention to deceive, the kind one runs across in
the dining-room of country hotels, or at cheap department stores. That it was appraised highly
in Siminol, however, was beyond question, and on every side swarthy faces watched eagerly to
see what impression it would make upon us, though the owner himself assumed a nonchalant air,
as became the possessor of so rare an article of virtu. It had evidently been in Siminol a
long time, and was possibly stolen from a trading-post on some piratical expedition, or looted
from a Spanish planter's home during a raid on a coast town, or more prosaically acquired in
exchange for curios. However that may be, it was considered a rare bit of bric-a-brac in Siminol,
and the possessor was counted a most fortunate man among his fellows.

There were many beautiful barongs bought that day, the natives willingly exchanging them for
money, which the Governor of Bongao declared was a unique way to disarm an enemy. American
gold was especially appreciated, and the natives passed a piece around from hand to hand with
an absolutely childish delight in its yellow beauty.

One of my purchases I paid for with a new five dollar gold piece, and before turning the money
over to the Moro, held it for a moment pendent from my ear to suggest an earring, pointing
at the same time to one of his wives, who was standing in the doorway of their house. The man
was delighted with the suggestion, as were numerous other Moros who had seen the pantomime,
and the woman in question clapped her hands and laughed aloud. I have often wondered whether
or not she received that earring, and if it became a universal custom in Tampakan to wear money
thus.

One of the officers, while drawing out some change from his pocket to pay for a very handsome
and expensive barong, came across a gold-plated spread eagle, such as officers wear on their
shoulder-straps. It was worth perhaps twenty-five or fifty cents, but it glittered alluringly
in the sunlight, and one of the Moros, with whom he had been bargaining, made a dive for the
bit of metal, calling on his companions to look at it. After a swift examination the owner
of the barong, to the officer's intense surprise, offered him the knife in exchange for the
worthless bauble. Noting the American's hesitation, and misinterpreting it, the Moro added
an embroidered turban to the knife, and waited in breathless expectation for his answer.

The officer still hesitated what to do, and then, through the interpreter, explained that the
eagle was of no monetary value, and that he could not accept so expensive a knife or such a
handsome turban in exchange for it. The Moro seemed astonished, but appreciated the reason,
and had his first lesson in the apothegmatic saying that all is not gold which glitters. Later
the eagle was given to the Bongao vigilante, who pinned it to the front of his fez, for was
he not a protector of the peace under the great American government?

To one side of Tampakan stood a plot of ground used as a cemetery. This we saw from a distance
only, the newly made graves presenting quite a gala appearance, decorated as they always are
with bright coloured umbrellas, these being usually of yellow. When a Moro is buried his grave
is protected from the sun and rain, and must be watched continually night and day for a period
of three months, doubtless to keep the corpse from being defiled by man or beast.

At about six o'clock we left Tampakan, being followed to the boats by the entire male population
of the town, even to toddling, naked boy babies, while the women hung out of their windows
in imminent danger of a fall and shouted strange things at us in their own tongue, which the
Bongao vigilante interpreted as "Good-bye, nice people, come again."

It was almost dark when we reached the Hilda, and she immediately put off for the ship, though
seeming literally to creep along, her engine wheezing even more painfully than earlier in the
afternoon. At that rate we should certainly be late for dinner, and all were hungry from the
trip across.

But a more serious contingency awaited us, for within a half-hour after starting, the native
fireman came up on deck, his face blanched with fear, to say the boiler would not work, and
that unless we could anchor at once we should be swept out to sea on the strong current. Soundings
were immediately taken, and the water found very deep, so, dragging our anchor, and with our
last remaining bit of steam, we reached a place shallow enough for anchorage. It was literally
the last gasp of the engine that put us in safety, for a moment more and we should have been
adrift on the trackless sea.

Of course the next thing to be done was to send up distress rockets, with which we had fortunately
provided ourselves, that the Burnside, whose lights we could faintly see far, far over on the
horizon, might know of our predicament; but as it was not yet dark enough for her to distinguish
our signal against the sunset sky, we decided to save our ammunition until there was no danger
of its not being seen from the ship, there being but three rockets aboard the Hilda.

Those few minutes of waiting seemed preternaturally long, and when the first rocket was finally
sent up, everyone watched, with almost feverish impatience, for the Burnside's return signal.
One minute passed in breathless silence; another minute, during which we shivered slightly
with cold and excitement; ten seconds more, and a sudden flash in the direction of the ship,
which we took to be a search-light answer to our rocket of distress, was greeted with a simultaneous
yell of delight. But our joy was dampened suddenly by some one suggesting that the search-light
might have been merely a coincidence as to time, and that the ship was in reality using it,
as often happened, for other purposes. Then, too, as this same Jeremiah pointed out, a distress
rocket would always be answered by a rocket, or at least by a Coston signal.

There was a general lowering of personal temperature at this, and a few moments later, with
even less confidence than we had sent up the first rocket, a second one was launched. But this
proved a failure, and went down instead of up, covering the water with a shower of golden sparks,
which hissed and sputtered angrily on the green waves that were rocking the little Hilda back
and forth as if she had been a cockle-shell. Of course there was no answer to this signal,
for the ship could not have seen it at her great distance.

In the meantime the tide was going out so rapidly that we soon found ourselves in only two
fathoms of water, the Hilda drawing one and a half fathoms, while every few minutes the bottom
of the launch ground ominously on the rocks below. The pilot of the little craft was stretched
out on the covered hatchway, frightfully seasick from the churning motion of the boat, when
the native engineer, ghastly with terror, reported to the Governor what we had for some time
suspected, namely, that we were anchored on a coral reef. To stay there much longer was out
of the question, but as the boiler would not work, the only other alternative was to let the
boat drift out to sea on the tide.

While we were all ostentatiously cool, I think there was not one among us but mentally computed
just how long it would take for a hole to be knocked in the bottom of the boat, leaving us
at the mercy of those cruel, green waves that licked at the Hilda's sides with foaming tongues,
eager for their prey. Our Jeremiah added to the general cheerfulness by advancing an enlivening
theory to the effect that the Siminol Moros would undoubtedly surround us ere long, attracted
by our futile signals to the ship, and brought up pleasant visions of swarthy pirates, under
the leadership of our interpreter, making us walk the plank, or fighting against us to the
death on a deck slippery with our own blood.

Only one more rocket left! How carefully it was hoisted to the top of the awning, and how circumspect
was the man who applied a lighted cigarette to the fuse, while the rest of us breathlessly
awaited the result. What if it, too, should prove a failure? The very thought was terrifying.
But there went the rocket--up, up, up,--a steadily mounting streak of red, which seemed to
touch the dark dome of the heavens before breaking into a shower of golden sparks. Eagerly
we watched the ship for some answering sign. The seconds seemed like hours, the minutes like
days. But at last, way over in the distance, a rocket from the Burnside split the darkness,
and we looked at one another silently, too deeply moved for cheers, knowing it was only a question
then of a race between our ship's launch and the hungry, hurrying tide.

After a bit we laughed and joked a great deal to make the moments pass more quickly, while
our host told good yarns and recited some of Eugene Field's inimitable verse in an inimitable
way, to a running accompaniment of the waves dashing against the side of the launch and her
occasional bumping on the rocks below. So long as most of us live I fancy that "Casey's Table
d'Hôte" will be associated in our minds with that night on the coral reef.

At last in the distance we saw the red, white, and blue Coston signal of the Burnside's launch,
its skipper doubtless asking us for a guiding light, our lantern on the masthead not being
visible over a mile. For a moment we were at a loss what to do, our last rocket having been
used to signal to the ship, but some one took a newspaper which had been wrapped around a package,
divided it in two, soaking one half of it in machinery oil from the engine-room. This greasy
paper was then put on the end of a fishing-spear, and, when lighted, it made a glorious blaze,
which was immediately answered by a second signal from the ship's launch, which changed its
course, making for us more directly. A little later, in answer to another signal, we lighted
the paper remaining, and in reply to still another, some waste soaked in oil did duty as a
light. By this time the launch was near enough for us to distinguish its whistle, to which
of course we could not reply, having no steam. Meanwhile the tide was very low. "Nine feet,"
announced some one, sounding, and the coral grated harshly under our keel. A moment more and
the launch might be too late.

But just then came another flash out of the gloom, so near that we were startled, a shrill
whistle, and the rescuing party was at hand. Very hurriedly the passengers were transferred
to the Burnside, Jr., and the Hilda was towed to a safe anchorage, where she was left for the
night.

The ride back to the ship was a long one, and we struck a tide-rip half-way there, which drenched
us all to the skin and tossed the staunch little craft back and forth, as if she had been a
chip on the water. But at eleven o'clock we climbed aboard the Burnside, after having given
the Powers-that-Be and our many friends a fright which made them threaten us with the brig
if it ever happened again.

Fortunately for us, our first rocket had been seen from the ship, else the launch might have
been too late to rescue us, and what we had taken for a gleam from the search-light was in
fact a Coston signal, our distance from the Burnside not enabling us to distinguish its red
and blue lights, the white alone carrying that far.

A good dinner, finished long after midnight, so rested us that, being young and foolish, we
went ashore with our host of the afternoon, merely for a farewell glimpse of Bongao, retiring
at ever so little o'clock in the morning, and not very long before the engines began to puff
and pant, preparatory to our trip northward.

Then followed a month of cable repairing, which took us again to Zamboanga, Iligan, and Cagayan.
A little stretch was also laid connecting Oslob, Cebu, with the Dumaguete land line, and later
a cable laid nearly two years before on the southeast coast of Luzon was thoroughly overhauled
and put into shape. This cable connected Pasacao and Guinayangan, or Pass-a-cow and Grin-again-then,
as we always dubbed the towns.

It was on our way to Pasacao from Iligan that we had our last glimpse of old Mount Malindang,
or, as the sailors called it, Mount Never Pass, because it was so seldom off our horizon. All
day the sea had been oily smooth, and fish jumped out of the water continually, the sea-gulls
swooping down upon them and carrying them off in their talons. The sailors had been holy-stoning
the decks and painting every bit of available woodwork white, preparatory to our entrance into
Manila Bay, and the cable machinery for the nonce was still, the native employees lounging
about the lower decks, playing monte or strumming their guitars in idle joy.

At sunset we all went aft to see Malindang for the last time. To the southeast it stood stolidly
against the flushed sky, a white cloud about it, reminding one of some old Indian chief wrapped
in his blanket, passively watching the departure of the pale-faces who had invaded his mighty
solitude. To the north were Negros, Cebu, and Siquijor; to the south Mindanao; and even far-distant
Camaguin to the east, with a faint wisp of smoke from its volcano. Then night came upon us
suddenly and blotted out Mount Never Pass--perhaps forever.

After our experiences in the far south, we found Oslob, Pasacao, and Guinayangan strangely
uninteresting, although at the beginning of our cable trip I have no doubt we should have enjoyed
them hugely. There were the same curious natives who dogged our every footstep; the same nipa
shacks surrounded by palms and bamboos in the same dazzling sunshine, of which no words or
symbols or formulas could give one an idea. There were the inevitable churches with decorations
of faded artificial flowers and much tarnished tinsel, the same wooden images with large eyes
and simpering little mouths, the same glaring chromos of the Virgin and her angels.

In Oslob the church was further decorated by brown velvet portières being painted at each side
of the long windows, an obvious advantage in the event of house-cleaning, while the wooden
pillars were also stained to resemble marble. At the time of our visit women knelt on the bare
floor at their prayers, all wearing stiffly starched white linen veils, which did not entirely
conceal their fleshly interest in ourselves, the while they told their rosaries with busy fingers.

Guinayangan had a wooden belfry to one side of its church, the bells therein being made of
metal arms captured from the Moros many years before. We also noticed, on entering the church,
a palanquin shaped affair at one side of the door. This, we were told, was used by the priest
in processions, when altar boys dressed in scarlet and white robes carry him thus enthroned,
two other boys walking ahead of the procession and two behind, all bearing candles in candelabra
taller than themselves, and all dressed in scarlet and white like the bearers of the palanquin.
It was used as well for a confessional, and to carry the priest to and from visits of extreme
unction.

Guinayangan also boasts a shipyard, which is nothing more than a rough shed, the implements
being most primitive in construction. Without even ways, not to mention the absence of means,
it is said that large sailing ships are made there, two of them being in the harbour at the
time of our visit.

For several days we hovered in the vicinity of Guinayangan and Pasacao, cutting and splicing,
splicing and cutting, while we idle ones of the quarter-deck unanimously decided that this
lower corner of Luzon Island comprised the prettiest landscapes we had seen on the trip, consisting
for the main part of wonderful mountains covered with a luxurious tropical growth of trees
and shrubbery, these perpendicular forests springing out of the water with scarcely any intervention
of beach between their green sides and the sparkling sea beneath them.

In places the mountains were bare of trees, suggesting forest fires in the past, but in the
distant past, as the patches of ground were covered with grass, the exact tender shade in which
the young Spring clothes herself at home. In many of these rifts between the trees nipa houses
were tucked away, adding to the charm of the landscape, and the multifarious shades of green
to be found on these hillsides were further diversified by shrub-like trees with a faint red
tinge like furze, and by still others with a silvery sheen to their leaves.

It was while paying this long-laid line into the tanks, when looking for faults, that wonderful
sea growths were brought up on the cable, especially in comparatively shallow water, revealing
varieties of submarine life undreamed of in our philosophy. There was white coral, and coral
in shades of pink, and red, and violet; there were sea-cucumbers and jellyfish; shrimp of tiny
proportions and scarlet in colouring; barnacles of every description; curious shells of fairy-like
proportions; seaweeds and grasses and moss of exquisite delicacy, making the cable look in
places as if it were a rope of tiny many coloured blossoms. The small girl of the Burnside
was enchanted with the pretty playthings sent her by the mermaids, and gathered the gaily tinted
wonders into a box for safe-keeping, but before the passing of another day they had lost their
beauty, and, moreover, smelled up to very heaven, and had to be thrown overboard.

But at last the Signal Corps completed its work on the Pasacao-Guinayangan cable, the final
splice was made, and the bight dropped overboard, whereupon we were off for Manila, stopping
en route at Pasacao to ascertain if all were well with the line. This was on Good Friday, and
the officers who went ashore said that natives, dressed to represent the Twelve Apostles, roamed
the streets and at given intervals flagellated one poor chap who had been elected to represent
Judas for the time being. The native padre assisted in the semi-religious function, and all
seemed more interested in it as a diversion than impressed by its devotional significance.

The rest of the day we sailed over absolutely peaceful water, with scarcely a ripple on its
crystal surface, swinging in and out of the myriad wooded islands, peninsulas, and capes that
make the southern part of Luzon so ragged and uneven on the map, and thence into the China
Sea, where we floated, sky above and sky below, for hours, anchoring off Manila on the following
forenoon, just in time to spend Easter Sunday, April 7th, at the capital.

And so ended our cable trip and those pleasant days in the far South Seas.

                         THE END.
